INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  mw  To: ODr. G. R. DiMarco May 8, 1984 From: M. Stowe  Subject: R&D and PT&D Projects on Specially Processed Tobaccos  Drs. Bernasek, Dickerson, and I have discussed the type of R&D work which we feel should. be conducted as an extention of the MaD Project. We recommend that work be undertaken in  R&D to 1) confirm the effect of this type of tobacco processing on smoking characteristics, and 2) determine which process(es) RJR should develop. An outline of the project work and staffing which we recommend for 1984 is attached.  Since further evaluation of blends ‘depends on the availability of adequate quantities of the specially) processed tobaccos, an attempt was made in late April to produce cast reconstituted sheet at TMCI, Inc. The sample arrived in R&D on Monday. If the smoking characteristics of this material are judged to be acceptable (or close enough to lead us to believe acceptable material can be made at TMCTY), then the R&D program outlined on the attached document should be feasible for 1984. If this is not the case, the timetable will be lengthened cansiderably. ,  Recommended staffing for the R&D project is shown on the project outline. The appropriate Managers have been contacted to determine that temporary assignment of the staff indicated to this project is possible if you approve this commitment of R&D manpower. Because his time is heavily committed to work on TGA, Dr. Casey is not included in the project staffing. Dr. Dickerson had indicated that a limited amount of his time would be available for consultation, and I will ask Dr. Lloyd if such an arrangement will still be possible.  A major objective for PT&D in 1984 should be to establish facilities for the production of experimental quantities of cast reconstituted sheet. This along with the planned upgrading of the G7 Pilot Plant will put us in a position to conduct process research on either ‘or both of these types of - reconstituted sheet. Without such facilities, it will not be possible to conduct research of :any quality on the  type of treatments needed. A memorandum is attached which outlines the work which PT&D will conduct in support of this  project.  Please let me know when you would like to discuss this project.  . an UK ye He XC: Dr. E.

UPHOLSTERED  FURNITURE ACTION COUNCIL : Box 2436 cM  High Point, NC 27261 (819) 835-5065  FABRIC CLASSIFICATION TEST METHOD--1990  I. BACKGROUND  To participate in the UFAC Voluntary Action Progran, upholstered furniture manufacturers must agree to produce their furniture in accordance with the basic UFAC construction criteria. In order to identify component materials which meet the UFAC requirements, a test method is needed to define acceptable performance in each criterion.  II. SCOPE  This test method is intended as the means of establishing the performance level of upholstery cover fabrics in contact with polyurethane foam with respect toe cigarette ignition resistance. Fabrics which meet the requirements of this test method may be labelled as UFPAC Class I, and may be used directly over conventional polyurethane in the horizontal seating surfaces of upholstered furniture bearing the UFAC hangtag. All other fabrics are UFAC Class II and require an approved barrier between the cover fabric and conventional polyurethane foam in the horizontal Seating surfaces.  III. GENERAL PROCEDURE  Vertical and horizontal panels of two inch UFAC Standard Polyurethane  Foam substrate are covered, using the fabric to be tested. The panels are placed in three specimen holders and a lighted cigarette is placed in each crevice formed by the abutment of vertical and horizontal panels of each assembly. Each cigarette is covered with a piece of sheeting fabric. The cigarettes are allowed to burn their entire length, unless an obvious ignition occurs. Test measurements and observations are recorded. A minimum of three test specimens are required for each cover  fabric sample to be classified.  TV. DEFINITIONS     1. IGNITION: Continuous, self-sustaining smoldering combustion of upholstered furniture substrates after exposure to burning cigarettes. 2. OBVIOUS IGNITION: Pronounced continuous and self-sustaining  combustion of the test system. Determination is a matter of operator judgement based upon experience in this type of testing. ~  3. SAMPLE: Upholstery cover fabric material being classified.  4. SPECIMEN: Individual piece of sample used in one test assembly.  5. CHAR: Area of fabric which is destroyed or degraded from face to. back, not including the area which is only discolored by smoke.  April 1, 1990  PTP9 ES8OS __label__Report

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: 25 September, 1987  From: Barbro Goodman  Subject: CIGARETTES. FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH  Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical Research, and Cigarette Technology personnel, several cigarette models were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke composition. The objective for the upcoming studies is to investigate the efifect of cigarette circumference and Mg (OH) 2 wrapper. In order to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes were made at three different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8 mm) each with a standard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156) and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from the same batch of tobacco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered configuration.  The selected blend was the current project TRIM blend with standard production components. DBC Bright, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC and RL 150B was used. It contained no stems or expanded tobaccos, so that better looking ultra slim cigarettes could be produced. All samples had the same casing and aftercut system.  The Hauni lab: max was: used for all three circumferences. Cellulose acetate filters were made with widely varying efficiencies in an effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries within reasonable levels. The tables attached to this memo give analytical data for each of the models. As can be seen in Table I, the 17 mm configuration gave extremely high RTDs for nonventilated cigarettes. This could have an efffect on mainstream puffing to a greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra slim prototypes. typically have RTD’s above 6" water for 45. - 55% filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for the slim cigarettes.  Tables II and III give the calculated diffferences in data for each circumference with the commercial and the low sidestream wrappers at standard circumference as controls.  2c0e  C87-@3852  aEStst __label__Memo

LONG-PATH INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR AIR POLLUTION RESEARCH  E. R. STEPHENS*  Franklin Institute Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  (Received 30 September 1960)  Abstract—Two long-path absorption cells have been designed and built for the measurement of gaseous contaminants in the atmosphere and for the laboratory study of reactions occurring in such atmospheres. These instruments are based on the White multiple-reflection system, having two large mirrors of 3 m radius of curvature at one end of the cell and a smaller mirror  of the same radius at the other end. To avoid excessive losses of radiant energy, the image of the infrared source is magnified and  demagnified to match the cell to the spectrometer. Optimum path for maximum absorption signal is reached when reflection losses reduce the energy to i/e of its initial value. This cor- responds to a path length of 120 m with the present cells although they have been successfully used at paths several times this length. It is possible to detect and identify many contaminants of importance in air pollution at concentrations of a few tenths of a part per million. The absorptions of water vapor and carbon dioxide make some regions of the spectrum opaque,  but this interference is not serious over most of the spectrum. The first of these cells was used for laboratory studies in Philadelphia and the second was mounted in a laboratory trailer and taken to southern California where it has been in use  since 1956 for the study of the atmosphere and related problems.  ONE of the most serious problems encountered in air pollution research is that of obtaining adequate analytical methods. Often one must try to analyze a complex mixture whose composition can only be guessed and in which the components of interest are present in very minute amounts. Chemical methods applied to such a problem suffer from the short- coming that serious interferences may be caused by components whose presence is not only unknown but unsuspected. An example of this is the potassium iodide method used to measure “oxidant” in the Los Angeles atmosphere. Although most of the so-called “oxi- dant” is believed to be ozone, the question of how much of it might be other oxidizing agents is still unresolved.  To meet the need for more specific analytical methods for the many substances of interest in air pollution. the Franklin Institute Laboratories have been developing the technique of long-path infrared absorption spectroscopy.  The primary interest in this work, which is sponsored by the Smoke and Fumes Com- mittee of the American Petroleum Institute, has always been the chemistry of air pollution rather than optics, spectroscopy, or analytical methods per se. For this reason, previous publications") have emphasized the results of reaction studies and described only superficially the instrumentation used. This paper is written in the belief that more details  of the long-path infrared technique may be of interest.  * Now with Scart Research Laboratories, P.O.

CAMEL SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT Week of 3/12/84     1) Focus groups were conducted in Dallas, TX last week to assess consumer reaction to CAMEL's recently approved Style Awareness and Relatability advertising approaches. A total of five groups were conducted among both male and female 18-34 year old competitive smokers. Overall, consumer reaction to both advertising approaches was very positive, and both were effective in communicating their intended messages. The focus groups also generated discussion of consumers' current perceptions about CAMEL and confirmed: the need for increasing overall brand style awareness. A full report of findings from these groups will be forwarded the week of 3/19.  2) The CAMEL team Positioning Process Hypothesis Development meeting was held on 3/14 at the Graylyn Conference Center.  This meeting served as the initial stage of development for reassessment of the brand's current positioning as defined by MDD's new positioning process. As next steps, MDD will specifically investigate each hypothesis generated using available data sources, Their findings will be presented to the brand team in April, after which implication to the brand's current positioning will be assessed.

Tobacco Institute  FROM: John Chwat  DATE: February 21, 1997  It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to cxiend our clients special interests throughout the United States. And, J appreciate the opportunity to tell you about an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our firm has taken the lead, on behalf of the NLBA, to establish new NLBA state affiliates and to build their  membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish new state affiliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA represented 18 states. As of the first of January ‘97, they represent 29 states. And, we have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA affiliation process. I'll give you a mo- down for cach state, later in this memo.  While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the pace of our membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine, the membership recruitment portion of Campaign 2000 is pick-and-shovel work that requires people and funds. Typically, our new state affiliates have a small cadre of people, but, understandably, no start-up funds. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite iny limited. budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases. However, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state affiliate logo’s and application forms, are often beyond the new slate affiliates financial capabilily. Accordingly, they are only able to do a limited amount of membership recruitment. While I expect the pace to speed-up over the next several months, J Temain concerned that the organizing groups may not be in a position to fully exploit a recent development that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live and mechanical), and/or television broadcasts.

The Hispanic market in Pheenix is clearly a full-taste non-menthel murket. Marlboro an¢ Winston are far and away the leading brands. At best, menthol usage among Hispanic smokers is about equal to the E al average (30%), In ne way does menthol usage in the Hispanic community resemble that of the Black community. There does not appear to be any stigma asgociated with menthol cigarcttcs however,            KOOL and Salem full-taste styles are neck and neck in the Phoenix Hispanic market but neither is considered by siore managers to be a fast mover in compazisen to Marlboro and Winston,  Low 'tar' brands, menthol and non-menthol, nave exhibited only marginal growth among Hispanics according to the trade. Roughly 10-20% of brands stocked in stores in the heart of the Hispanic com- munity were hi-fi's.     Very litile promotional activity was observed at retail in the Hi nie market, A few American “pack tape-on" displays were observed as well ag some blister pack lighter offers far Decade. The receptivity of the trade ic on-pack promotional items varied. Cigarette coupon redemption was reported to be low to non-existent.            SILEISOLG __label__Memo

However, the major benefit for me was  their overall positioning guidance - what to communicate and 7 (especially) what not to communicate.     We are moving very, very fast. And as we move forward over the next several months we will all stay open to modifying these early positioning thoughts. However, for now this  positioning gives us the necessary focus against which to make changes.  Positioning Thoughts  What Helps - 1. Every group has voiced surprise, "shock" at how good the product tastes. Of course we'll make final  determinations and modifications based on product testing. But this reaction is sure nice to see.  2. Thirty cigarettes (10 extra, pack and a half) is very positive to many respondents. - While taste is important  ("ten extra what"), this added quantity is our uniqueness, and will be very important to trial.  3. Good taste and low tar is an important, unsatisfied need for many smokers. Relative to Carolina 30's, we  particularly saw this in the second session yesterday.  4. Although not explicitly probed, the brand name Carolina 30's seems to work well. I believe it brings  assurance, credibility and good taste overtones to this new brand.  QTESECTS __label__Memo

PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  To: To All Philip Morris Employees cate: August 23, 1996 FRM: Geoffrey C. Bible  SUBECT: FDA Regulation of Tobacco Products  Today President Clinton announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued regulations governing tobacco products, with the stated purpose of reducing underage tobacco use. As you know, we firmly believe that kids shouldn't smoke, and we're leading the industry in preventing underage access to cigarettes.  On May 15, we proposed federal legislation that would make it impossible for anyone to legally obtain tobacco products in the U.S. without a face-to-face transaction where age can be verified. We believe a legislative approach, which President Clinton has said he would prefer, would take us a long way toward the goal we all share: a marketplace where kids cannot buy cigarettes. We hope Congress will take up this issue soon.  The FDA's plan is wrong-headed. It's illegal. And we're going to fight it with everything we've got. The agency claims it must seize control over cigarette advertising, promotion and sales to prevent underage smoking. And FDA Commissioner Kessler says that once his agency takes control of the tobacco industry, it could ban cigarettes.  This Pandora's box of regulation flies in the face of the law, the facts, history, common sense and public opinion. In our corner we have the U.S. Constitution, recent decisions by the Supreme Court, Congressional history and past statements by FDA commissioners. What's more, the vast majority of Americans take our side on the central issues, including the right of adults to make their own choices about whether to smoke and our right to market  |  our products to adults.  Our blueprint for legislation contains many of the same elements the FDA has proposed. But under our plan, the FDA will be expressly forbidden  £osZeveloz __label__Memo
RUA SOON ayy  Subject:  To:        AL © C  e Memorandum  Alternate Approaches to Low-Sidestream Cigarettes Date: December 21, 1982  Dr. A. Rodgman From: D. E. Townsend Dr. D. H. Piehl Mr. J. D.Phillips  Several staff members in R&D have obtained information which is epplicable to the development of low-sidestream cigarettes. I have prepared two low-sidestream prototypes, one with information obtained by Dr. J. L. Harris and the other with Harrie’ information combined with the use of “carbonized” filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal emoking suggeste that these prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating sidestream sroma which ie common to the current CC~prototypes.  Dr. Harris has demonstrated (R&DM, 1982, No. 50; CIM, 1980, No. 27; CIM, 1977, No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without CaCO, filler results in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries.” The major disadvantage is that due to the reduced smolder rate, the puff count is extraordinarily high (“20-25 puff/cig). He suggested that unusual configurations are required to obtain cigarettes with reasonable deliveries and puff counts.  Prototype DET-111682-B was prepared with CaCO,-free cigarette paper (supplied by Schweitzer) and 27.5mm long non air-diluted filters made with 2.9/44,000 tow. NOW 100 blend (high G-13 level) was used in an effort to reduce the puff count to acceptable levels. The resulte of smoke analyses are presented in Table 1. It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS 'tar' “25mg/cig), substantial reductions (750%) in measured sidestream ‘tar’ were achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were obtained.  Prototype DET~111682-A was similar to that described above except that the filler included 302 “carbonized” flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. White). Mr. White has demonstrated that the use of “carbonized” filler in @ blend results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The results of smoke analyses for this prototype are also presented in Table 1. A comparison of samples A and B shows that the use of “carbonized” filler resulted in further sideatream 'tar' reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as only an upper limit, however. Dr. Harris has demonstrated that the routine method for measurement of sidestream ‘tar’ is in error for cigarettes which contain “carbonized” filler. The actual 'tar' delivery is somewhat less than that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS ‘tar’ from  cigarettes with “carbonized” filler. Thus, all we can say at this point is that the sidestream ‘tar’ reduction is in excess of ~ 60%,  The results of visible sidestream measurements are unavailable at this  time due to the load and priority of CC-prototypes. However, it is clear that the visible sidestream is very low.  LOST 6S2TS  RJR} FORM 2422—Rev. 7/70 __label__Letter

INTER-OFFICE  CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  () be  Date: February 4, 1992  Subject: 1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee  The membership of the 1993-1997 R&D Strategic Planning Committee was generated by consultation with R&D management and management outside R&D. Those listed have been selected to serve on this committee. I hope to contact most of you by telephone before you receive this memorandum to discuss with you the goals and plans of the committee. If I have not been able to do so, please accept my apologies.  A meeting of the R&D Strategic Planning Committee will be held within the next one or two weeks to begin our important work for the coming year. I realize how difficult it is to schedule meetings for such a large group, and the realities are that any individual cannot attend each meeting we have during the year. However, I strongly urge you to attend the first meeting  because a number of organizational issues and goals will be discussed. Please arrange a substitute when possible for future meetings.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  Those_Listed  H. Alonso C. Campbell A. Confer  K. Cox  K. Detenber R. Fenner  B. Fischer P.. Gauvin W. Glover R. Heretick T.

Wall  RE: Modification of May 4, 1994 Document Disposal Suspension Notice  Requiring Retention of Electronic Mail and Other Electronic Récords in  Their Original Electronic Media  On May 4, 1994, the attached document disposal suspension notice  (“suspension notice”) was issued as a result of a court order in pending litigation.  The suspension notice required, among other things, that electronic mail and other _.  electronic media be retained in their original electronic form for the categories of  records described in the suspension notice.  _._ The court order requiring the retention of electronic media has been modified by limiting the obligation to. retain electronic records subject to the suspension notice to those written or generated on or before March 29, 1994. Effective on receipt  of this memorandum, the procedure specified in the suspension notice for retaining electronic mai! and other electronic records in their original electronic form may be  discontinued prospectively for those electronic records capable of being printed.  From receipt of this memorandum onward, electronic mail and other electronic  records, if any, should now be retained, by printing and retaining a paper copy  only, in accordance with the usual retention practice for electronic records subject  to each Records Management Manual’s Appendix entitled Topics Subject to  Disposal Suspension. However, electronic records subject to disposal suspension  that are incapable of being printed must continue to be maintained in electronic  form. Except as modified in this memorandum, prior document suspension notices  and the Appendix entitled Topics Subject to Disposal Suspension in each Records  Management Manual remain in effect without change.  006226PS02 __label__Memo
THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE  1875 { STREET, NORTHWEST SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR. WASHINGTON, DC 20006 President 202/457-4800 © 800/424-9876 MEMORANDUM , March 24, 1992 ‘, To: The Members of the Executive Committee  From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. i.  Today, by a vote of 8-7, the Los Angeles city Council rejected a smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking restriction measure. The phased-in ordinance proposal would require 60 percent of restaurant seating space be set aside for nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors.     This measure now goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote, probably within the next 60 days. The mayor must then sign the  measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign this ordinance.  While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I Know you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive, complex and complete. That complete industry effort will continue in the same vein throughout the process.  cc: Members of the Management Committee TI Senior Staff  DEVLGL26  A aN tN Ril SATE PATNI RIE EP acts ot, __label__Memo

March 20, 1992  Senator Harold R. Finn State Office Building St. Paul MN 55155  Dear Senator Finn:  Solving our health care insurance problems are going to require far more difficult solutions than simply making  Minnesota’s tobacco tax the highest in the nation at the expense of Minnesota’s businesses.  If Governor Carlson’s proposal goes through, one group of businesses and consumers will bear the burden of paying for a necessary and vital program. My only question to you is this: what happens when those customers go elsewhere to buy their tobacco and the state doesn’t collect the’ amount of money it needs to finance this program? Where will the money come from next? Who is going to make the decision on who gets coverage and who doesn’t when the money runs out?  Customers of Minnesota businesses and most importantly their employees should not be the ones who have to pay the price because Governor Carlson and some legislators think raising tobacco taxes solves the problem of affordable and  accessible health care. We don’t need gimmicks; we need leadership.  Sincerely,  arte. Caw Orda,  Darla Edwards RT 2 Box 274 Nevis, MN 56467  TIMN 458860 __label__Letter

PROJECT NUMBER: 1740 DATE: November 1, 1983  PROJECT TITLE: Flavor Components of Tobacco and Filler  PROJECT LEADER: C. S. Kroustalis  PERIOD COVERED: September 26 = October 25, 1983  I.  TOBACCO AND FILLER  A.  The following compounds were identified in the 8-glucosidase  hydrolyzate of the E-55 glucosidic fraction by Dr. F. Hsu  using GC/MS: 3-methyl-l-butanol, 2-methyl-2-buten-l-ol, 3—hexen-l-ol, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethylalcohol, 2-methy1-5-(2-methyl-5-isopropenyl tetrahydro-2-furyl) furan (tentative identification), 3-oxo-a-ionol, blumenol C, 4-(3-hydroxybutylidene)-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexone (two isomers), cadineol, and hydroxysolavetivone (two isomers).  Propyl paraben determinations have been made on 45 RL samples and size. Size samples at timed intervals during a Pilot Plant run showed no concentration variation over several hours. RL sheet samples analyzed randomly indicated a small amount of application cycling in concentration levels. Standard response in the range of 100 to 2200 ng/yl was linear. Lower limit of detection under current analytical practices is 1.20 ng/ul. The RL sheet generated will be made into cigarettes to determine dust generation from RL as well as possible transfer of propyl paraben to non-RL blend  components.  We are currently working with Ms. E. T. Oakley in developing a procedure for estimating oriental tobacco in cigarettes. The methyl ester of 8-methylvaleric acid is used as the marker for oriental. Contributions from bright and burley tobaccos appear to be minimal (<10 ug/g versus 950 ug/g for oriental).  Preliminary results with synthetic Marlboro blends show good correlations, but B-methylvaleric acid concentration ranges in various grades of oriental from different countries need to be determined.  A procedure is being developed for determining C2-C,. volatile fatty acids in tobacco and filler. Although we were not successful with butyl ester derivatives because of dilution problems, benzyl ester derivatization shows promise. This procedure involves the reaction of the tetrabutylammonium salts of the acids with benzyl bromide in acetone.  ai S ar oo ~ “I an si Ne or __label__Scientific

D. denkins  Changes in Smoking Characteristics by Type of Employment From 1970 to 1979/80 [cre “yor,  James J. Weinkam, osc, and Theodor D. Sterling, PhD     Changes in the distribution of smoking status between and within occupations by sex, race, and age are examined for 1970 and 1979/80, 10 years that saw rapid changes in smoking prevalence. The pattern of occupation within smoking categories remains basically unchanged, and, in fact, becomes more pronounced among males. The proba- bility of young people taking up smoking remains tied to eventual occupational choice. The decline in smoking prevalence is larger among the employed than among those who  are not employed. There has been a substantial increase in refusals to answer questions about smoking.  Key words: occupation, smoking prevalence, smoking decline     INTRODUCTION  There have been a number of reports on prevalence of smoking by occupation, based largely on data collected prior ta 1971 [Sterling and Weinkam, 1976, 1978; Covey and Wynder, 1981; Blair et al, 1985]. However, profound changes have taken place since then that may have affected both the mix of occupations and the prevalence of smoking of the U.S. population. Widespread introduction of new technology may have operated to lessen the importance of certain service jobs and to increase technical, professional, and clerical employment. These same factors may also have contributed to a shift in racial differences in occupation. Housewives have entered or reentered the labor force in increasing numbers. At the same time, there appears to have been an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking.  Changes in smoking prevalence oyer time raise a number of questions of importance to occupational health investigations:  1. Have ‘here been changes in the occupational differences in smoking prevalence?  2. Have there been changes in the distribution of occupations within various smoking categories?  3. Are such changes similar for females and males, for blacks and whites?  School of Computing Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.

_—a 3970 Association of Profilin with Filament-free Regions of  Human Leukocyte and Platelet Membranes and Reversible Membrane Binding during Platelet Activation  John H. Hartwig,** Kristen A. Chambers,* Karen L. Hopcia,* and David J. Kwiatkowski**  ® Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, and * Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology and § Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  Massachusetts 02114  Abstract. Profilin is a conserved, widely distributed actin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin monomers in a high affinity profilactin complex. In vitro, the complex is dissociated in response to treat- ment with the polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylino- sitol monophosphate, and phosphatidylinosito) 4,5- bisphosphate. Here, we demonstrate the ultrastructural  ROFILIN is a 12-15-kD cytoplasmic actin monomer P binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson ¢1 al., 1976: Magdolen et al., 1988; Reichstein and Korn, 1979). Mammalian profilin occurs as a single isotype (Ampe et al., 1988; Kwiatkowski and Bruns, 1988) and interacts with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment into actin filaments. In vitro, the affinity of mammalian spleen profilin for skeletal muscle actin monomer is relatively tow. Ks = 1-50 pM (Markey et al., 1982; Nishida, 19853, is higher for nonmuscle actin, K, = 10-400 nM (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988), whereas profilin and actin can be puri- fied as a high affinity, K, = 1-10 nM, profilactin complex cells (Blikstad et al., 1980; Carlsson et al., 1976; Hanis and Weeds, 1978; Malm, 1984; Markey et al... 1978). The factor(s) responsible for the high affinity profilactin complex have not been identified (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988). The transien) appearance of the high affinity compiles before and/or during platelet activation (Lind ct al., 1987, Markey et al., 1981) suggests that some mechanism exists in- side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing and Lindberg (1985) have demonsteated that the high affinity complex can be dissociated by treatment with the polyphos- Phoinositides, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP).' and phosphatidylinosito! 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) in vitro. More recently, human platelet profilin has been shown to bind PIP and PIP, reconstituted into vesicles in vitro (Lass- ing and Lindberg, 1988; Goldschmidt-Clermont, P.. J. Bal- dassare, and T.

In both cell types, a significant fraction of profilin is found associated with regions of cell membrane devoid of actin filaments and other discern- ible structures. After platelet activation, the membrane association of profilin reversibly increases. This study represents the first direct evidence for an interaction between profilin and phospholipids in vivo.  notan interaction between phosphoinositides and profilin oc- curs in vivo and whether this interaction regulates the transi- tion between the high and tow affinity states of the profilactin complex.  PIP and PIP; consist of an acidic, phosphorylated inositol side group connected to a glycero! backbone to which two long hydrophobic acy! chains are attached. They are. there- fore, likely to reside in cellular membrane compartments, and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman, 1975; Maucoet al., 1987). The presence of rnultip!e distinct meta- bolic pools of PIP and PIP; in erythrocytes and platelets (Billah and Lapetina, 1982; King et al., 1987). suggests. moreover, that some PIP and PIP; are sequestered in the plasma (and perhaps othe intracellular) membrane(s). pos- sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and Marchesi, 1985: Sheetz et al., £982).  In support of an intracellular interaction between profilin and membrane-bound PIP and PIP;, here we provide direct morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por- tion of cellular profilin with membranes in both intact human platelets and 'Wakocytes. In addition. we demonstrate a re- versible. transient association between profilin and plasma membrane after the activation of platelets, consistent with previous observations of the formation/dissociution of pro- fitactin complexes during platelet activation.

Test results indicate that increasing licorice would be the most practical means of maintaining sweetness in chewing tobaccos, from both quality and cost standpoints, should saccharin be banned. FDA has not yet banned the use of saccharin in foods, but has reported finding bladder tumors in some of the animals used in their feeding studies.  Licorice from Chemicals and Phosphates, Ltd.  Tests designed to qualify a higher percentage of C&P licorice on Days Work , and to re-qualify it for other plug brands have been completed and a report issued. Test results indicated that products made with C&P licorice were equal to or better than controls. Manufacturing approved the recommendation that the Plug Division be allowed to use C&P licorice for up to two-thirds of the licorice requirements for each plug brand.  Rishmac Licorice  Tests designed to evaluate and qualify spray dried licorice produced in Iran by MacAndrews & Forbes on plug tobacco have been completed and a report issued. Test results indicated that this licorice would be suitable for up to fifty per- cent of the licorice requirements for chewing tobaccos. Usage of Rishmac licorice at this percentage was recommended in the report and Manufacturing accepted the recommendation.  PROJECT NO. 2356 - FIRMENICH/RJR BURLEY PROGRAM     Burley Flavor Modifiers  Preliminary evaluation of Burley Flavor Modifiers (Series 17, 18, and 19) submitted to RJR in October, 1972 was completed in January and a report submitted  to Firmenich, Two flavors (RJR 17C and 19B) were accepted for commercial evaluation  and Series 18 was rejected. The date for acceptance or rejection of 17C and/or .19B is January 16, 1974, Firmenich has accordingly provided us with a list of 27 compounds present in the Burley Tobacco Essential Oil which are in 17C and 19B. Our top dressing tests to date indicate that 17C is the best of these two flavors. An additional evaluation report was submitted to Firmenich in March.  866L thos __label__Letter

Letters to the Editor  On Ulcer Therapy  Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro- versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June 23) with interest.  Some years ago, I discarded the’  theory of hyperacidity as a total  ‘ cause for the presence of the benign  duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided that the Sippy diet was inadequate.  Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is     a multifaceted disorder involving not only hyperacidity but hypermotility, infection, allergy, and local endarte- ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur- geon, I recognize that adequate medi- eal therapy for the benign ulcer must include eradication of any or all of the above factors in order to satisfac- torily rectify the disease.  ‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me because it not only did not clear all the symptoms but left the patient weak and unhappy. With the treat- ment that I followed [which begins with placing the patient on a milk-, wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only was relief frequently obtained, but there was an absence of the monot- ony of a milk and cream diet. Often  dramatic symptoms of well-being ©  were encountered, particularly if [an allergy to} milk was [causing the disorder]... .  MILTON W. WHITE, M.D. Detroit  Sir: I have just read with interest the article “Controversies in Ulcer Ther-  12  F1EqICSi VVC CWE em  apy.” There are many ideas put forth about medication, diet, and rest, but I was greatly disappointed that no one mentioned anything about the effect of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.  I have been in general practice for 41 years in the western part of Cin- cinnati, and although I have not kept the kind of statistics that research people do, I have come to some very firm conclusions about the relation- ship of smoking to ulcers.  In fact, I have had many patients come to me with recurrent ulcers— having been treated by other doctors without success—who healed their ul- cers within a few weeks when the abolition of smoking was added to their daily routines. I have also had many other patients who did not stop smoking and who had recurrences, al- though they stayed on a diet and [took] antacids.  As a result of this experience, for the past 20 years I have refused to treat all ulcer patients unless they  ‘ would promise to stop smoking per-  manently. FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, M.D. Cincinnati  Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy” interested me very much in that at this late hour in medical history con- troversy should exist on the subject.  Certainly there is a consensus that if you can maintain neutralization of the gastric acidity and establish con- comitant normal digestion through- out the gut, you are going to heal the ulcer—providing the area has not been so cicatrized [that] normal arte- rial, venous, and lymphatic movement to [it has been completely cut off].  When this has occurred, a gastro- plasty or duodenoplasty would appear to be entirely proper.  But a vagotomy at qny time sug- gests .. . surgical-medical incompe- tence in the fields of diet, psychothe- rapy, and physiology.  ERNEST J. CARLSON, D.O. Denver  Sudden Loss of Hair Pigment  Sir: The article “White from Fright— or Lack of Henna?” (mwN, June 23)  RTS tied  Pi) "© HKa0074158  brings to mind my critical evaluation of the subject 40 years ago in Hand- book der Haut und Geschlechtsk- rankheiten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011- 1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and published by Julius Springer Verlag in 1988. The article I wrote for that / collection was titled ‘Pathological  Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair)  in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and  Psychiatry.”  Gradual graying of the hair is fe netically determined. But there’ is abundant evidence that canitieg, or premature depigmentation of /air, can result from continued severe stress. However, as [your article re-- porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E. Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-  tening of hair—e.g., overnight or in a |  day—is still disputed as it was 40 years ago, largely because it is Very        complete, one partial, of relatively rapid development in young soldiers in World War I. To be exact, eannot be accepted as cases nities subita sive acutissima because the individuals were not seen imme- diately before and after the occur- rence. This requirement is seldom ful- filled.  The effect of disorders of the ner- vous system (especially the sympa~ thetic), as well as metabolic and endo- crine disturbances, on skin and hair are well established but rarely come to the attention of the dermatologist. Aside from their diagnostic signifi- eance and scientific interest, abnor- malities of the pigment do not cause any therapeutic stir.  _ It may be for this reason that the questions of the formation of air or gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc- ing a white appearance] has not been settled, which one would expect, con- sidering the advanced technology of electron microscopy. I have seen un- der the microscope (at a magnifica- tion of x 1600) the disintegration of the medullary area of the shaft of a diseased whitened hair, while the cor- tex was relatively intact. .

Attached is the version of S.B. 55 approved by the Senate Health & Human Services Committee. It is an improvement over the original bill that you reviewed previously. Deleted is the ban on outdoor advertising and the provision that would have prohibited an adult consumer from redeeming a coupon in a face-to-face transaction. Also, administration has been moved from the Department of Health to the State Comptroller’s office, which is a much better agency for enforcement of this law.  This bill, however, still has two major problems:  1) Aself-serve ban. ,  2) A 10% tax on outdoor tobacco advertising to pay for a tobacco education media campaign plus expanding the state’s current outdoor advertising ban from 500 to 1,000 feet from a church or school.  The bill also has the 27 year old carding requirement.  Please review this latest version and let me know if you identify other major concerns that we need to address.

Now, I need the wisdom especially.  It is possible that at some time in the future there may be some legal action which would touch CTR. We need someone of stature who would be willing to plainly state the facts, i.e., that the research supported by CTR over the years was never influenced by our sponsors and that the award of funds for biomedical research were made with total objectivity  by the SAB. No one is better qualified to do this than you are,  Frankly, this matter may never come up. The first anticipated possibility of needing such testimony is some two or three years in the future. However, our lawyers do want to know whom they might call upon, and I hope you will agree to do this.  Needless to say, you would be reimbursed for your time and expenses in connection with anything of this sort.  If you feel that you would be able to help me; I would appreciate it if you would send along a copy of your current curriculum vitae and bibliography. I will in turn pass them along to our attorneys.  I hope that you and Lou are doing well and I send my warmest personal regards always. Thanks and all best wishes.  Sincerely, Ly  mes F.

Yatrakis  Subject: Flavor Development Weekly Summary - Week of August 14, 1989  PROJECT ART:  A low pressure trial was run at the Bermuda Hundred Factory. Four (4) loops of filler were extracted at 2400 psi, 140 °F and 150 M/M. Extraction efficiency met the 97% target. Cigarettes will be requested in the low/ultra~low, KS/100mm and regular and menthol versions.  Bermuda Hundred Modules IIA and IIB achieved targeted extraction efficiency. Models were made and subjectively evaluated from both. Subjective approval was given for both Module IIA and IIB for production of BERM, CIG 8 and CIG &M filler.  A large-scale casing trial using 8$C-392 pilot plant filler has been completed in Semi-works with a new casing formulation (8611-78-1). Cigarettes have been requested with aftercut (8mg) for comparisons to the current casing, and without aftercut (8, 11, and 15mg) for further laboratory evaluations of new aftercut systems.  All of the filter modification models have been made and are in analytical for physical testing. Subjective evaluation of the models has been initiated. Evaluations continued with alkaline treatment of filler and filters in an effort to increase overall response of ART cigarette smoke.  The large-scale portion of the nicotine add-back study is complete. The nicotine add-back for small-scale has been rescheduled for early September.  Subjective screening has been completed of 24% RL’s (Marlboro configuration) from Park 500 with 2% and 4% Bermuda stem. The 4% level again was clearly different. Evaluation of combinations of these RL’s with test RCB’s (11% and 16% Bermuda stem) at normal levels in Marlboro are in progress to select models for POL tests. Pilot ES tests are in progress on both MPC and citric acid post-ART stem based on encouraging subjective results with NH,OH and Ca (OH), treatments. Analytical and subjective tests are in progress to establish specifications for Louisville ZS production trials.

The award is made without guarantee of support beyond June 30, 1988, even though we recognize that your application proposes a study extending two years beyond that date. Therefore, if by November 30, 1987 you submit to us a formal renewal application, including a report of your progress to date, your request will receive consideration.  Your attention is called to the enclosed “Important Procedural Information for Grantees”. Please fill in the attached “Notice of Research Project” and return it to me. Drs. Harmon McAllister, Research Director, and David Stone, Associate Research Director, will serve as your primary contact with our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant.  Please consult the staff as questions or problems arise, and keep us informed about the progress of your study.  AS Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances at the end of cach grant year. We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of expenditures and commitments to assure that you agree with your institution’s official financial statement at the end of the grant year. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Finally, please be aware that our failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office will stop further grant payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the grant year, Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this statement of our fiscal policies will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

The test can be performed In a few minutes by @ techni: dan using equipment that costs only $150. He simply runs a small metal wheel over prescribed areas of the pay ilent's skin.  The wheel is an electrode, attached to two small batter. Jes. Another electrode is at- tached to the patient’s leg. A  meter records the resistance encountered by the flow of current, and the technician maps the pattern on a draw- ing of the human body.  “Almost everything that hap- pens in the body Is referred to the skin,” said Dr. Curt P.

The Liggett “Settlement” Doesn’t Change the Facts  The law isn’t determined by public relations.  That’s why courts and juries have consistently rejected arguments that the tobacco industry should pay damages to smokers, and why courts continue to insist that states cannot ignore the fact that individuals choose to smoke and states choose to make substantial profits in the form or excise taxes.  Perhaps that’s why Liggett received such favorable terms in their “settlement.” Behind the media hoopla, here are the facts:  ¢ A $25 million dollar payout. But only if Liggett is acquired or acquires another tobacco company. Translation: nothing.  e A 25% payment from their profits. Liggett isn’t making a profit. Translation: nothing.  We continue to believe that as a matter of law, the states’ Medicaid lawsuits are fundamentally flawed.  Attorney General Grant Woods of Arizona may have said it best a few months before he decided to hop on the politically correct bandwagon.  In May 1996, the Arizona Business Gazette reported that Attorney General Woods said he “never liked the idea of filing suit against tobacco companies...such litigation made little sense, particularly since smoking is a voluntary habit and cigarettes are  legal...After all, if cigarette manufacturers could be sued for the detrimental health effects of their products, why not the people who manufacture and sell alcohol? Or even red meat?”  He was right then. He remains right today.  And what do other lawyers in this litigation think of this “settlement?” Stanley Rosenblatt, a Miami lawyer handling two cigarette class-action suits in Florida, who -- when he learned of the class action filed against and with the concurrence of Liggett -- told the New York Times: “This is a phony gimmick designed to enrich a bunch of plaintiffs’ lawyers.” Rosenblatt told the Miami Herald, “I have to take a deep breath to avoid cursing... This attempted settlement is a disgrace.”  Ht  9@SS bZSTsS __label__Report

(Jack) Ce: Glenn, Charles; Hallman, Clinton; Barrington, Marty; Holleran, Jack  Subject: Superslims US patient case - it's aver  i'm pleased to report that the B&W patent infringement suit re Virginia Slims Superstims is finally over in the US. PM USA has won.  In particular, last fall PM USA was successful at the Federal Circuit in arguing that the relevant claims of B&W's US Reissue Patent 32,615 re a cigarette w/ a reduced circumference were invalid, which upheld a '99 ruling to the same effect by federal district court in Louisville in a trial beginning in '89. B&W attempted to have a rehearing at the Federal Circuit and was denied. The time has now passed for B&W's last recourse, a petition to the Supreme Court, without any filing by them.  Re specifics, this clears the way for future PM USA production of Superslims for export, assuming no relevant BAT patents in the particular countries of destination. We are currently researching the issue specifically in Japan to see if there are other BAT patents in addition to the BAT Japanese patent successfully invalidated by JT with PM assistance and will report the results when available in ~3-6 weeks. Of course, our proposed global resolution to BAT in response to their offer to setile the issue in Australia would resolve this question on a worldwide basis.  Special recognition needs to be made of Jim Schardt, who handled this entire matter for many years with great skill, patience, and foresight.  We'll keep you posted. Pls. let me know if you have any questions. thanks  VCCCHOLS 807 __label__Email
introduction  The c-fos gene belongs to the family of growth- and differentiation-related immediate early genes whose expression, in vivo and in vitro, represents the first measurable response to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli including tumor promoters and DNA-damaging agents. The expression of c-fos has been identified as a signai for ceil proliferation, but also for apoptosis.  Key Findings:  2R1 mainstream smoke-bubbled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) induces c-fos expression in quiescent 3T3 fibroblast cells ...  conceniration-dependenily. A threshold concentration of approx. 0.015 puffs/ml was observed.  by interfering with transcriptional and  posttranscriptional regulatory components since a slight induction of the c-fos promoter and a strong stabilization of c-fos transcripts were observed. The translation of smoke- bubbled PBS-induced c-fos mRNA into protein was confirmed using immuno-  detection methods.  independently of the presence of hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton reaction since neither o-phenanthroline - an efficient, membrane permeable scavenger of iron cations - nor catalase were able to reduce cigarette smoke- dependent c-fos expression at concentrations that were shown to inhibit DNA  strand break formation.  the kinetics being different from those reported for physiological inducers (growth factors, serum), TPA, or stress treatment (heat shock, UV, hydroxyl  radicals).  in a manner very similar to that described for okadaic acid, a specific inhibitor of cell cycle-specific phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP-1/2A). Cellular effects  shared by smoke-bubbled PBS and okadaic acid in vitro are:  e kinetics of c-fos expression,  e pattern of c-fos expression, ie., the slight activation of the c-fos promoter as well as the stabilization of c-fos mRNA, partial inhibition of protein synthesis,  induction of stress response genes such as heme oxygenase, induction of cell cycle arrest, and  inhibition of PP-1/2A enzymatic activities.  “  associated with a concentration-dependent loss of total celluiar glutathione (GSH).  €20EE0 1062 __label__Scientific

Lillian,  TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  January 20, 1993 TO: M. S. Ireland FROM: A. Prakash  SUBJECT: Analysis of Phenols in an Experimental Cigarette Sample Made With Brown Wrapping Paper and Compared to the Reference Cigarette, 1725-89 (PROJECT B 451 CMP)  Phenols in the mainstream smoke of 85 mm straight cigarette sample, submitted by J. H. Bell, were quantitated by HPLC (1). The sample cigarettes were made of brown wrapping paper. An earlier memorandum (2) on phenol results for the brown paper cigarettes is invalid since the sample was incorrectly identi-  fied.  Three cigarettes per pad were smoked by a single port smoking machine in J. H. Bell’s laboratory. The Cambridge pad containing the particulates of the mainstream smoke was extracted with 20 mil of isopropanol from the smoking laboratory. The isopropanol extract was diluted with equal volume of 6% aqueous acetic acid and analyzed for phenols. Results of the analyses are presented in Tables I and II.  A review of the results based on wet tar suggested lower hydro- quinone levels in the brown paper cigarettes compared to the reference, 1725-89. The results of the brown paper cigarettes were not consistent as seen from the relative standard deviations being greater than 25%, whereas the control showed a relative standard deviation 4-7%.  t C NA de foo Le  A.

Garman Date: September 17, 1990  From: Barbara T. Joyner  Subject: Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol Cigarette  The product "Smoke-Free Twenty-two Menthol" submitted by Judy Smith, was - analyzed for the determination of nicotine, glycerin, PG and menthol. A non-mentholated version of Smoke-Free Twenty-Two was analyzed previously for the same components.’ The product is packaged as five "pellets" of a tobacco-like material. One pellet is inserted into the tip end of a plastic filter holder resembling a hollow cigarette rod and is puffed upon.  The product was assembled and "puffed" for forty consecutive 35 ml puffs to determine the presence of any released components in the vapor state. Nicotine, PG, glycerin and menthol vapors released through puffing on a 5-port smoking machine were trapped and analyzed following a previously established procedure? The components released by dry puffing were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results generated from the menthol version are compared to results from the non-menthol version reported previously are shown below:  Menthol = = —s_ Non-Menthol  Nicotine ND Glycerin ND PG ND Menthol <0.2 mg  5866  The pellets were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Analysis for glycerin, PG, menthol, and TA showed no within and between carton differences. Comparisons of these components to Twenty-Two (Regular) showed greatest difference in menthol levels.

Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102  Dear Mr. Oldaker,  Tread your recent letter to Dave Tott telling of your past association with Art Yorozu. You also described your analytical model predicting levels of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins, and requested detailed information on the B727 ventilation, air velocities and leakage rates.  We appreciate your need to improve the accuracy of your analytical model by obtaining the described detailed information. Unfortunately, the limited amount of information that we may be able to provide you would be of little use. All information on air velocities, ventilation rates and  _ leakage rates for the B727 is for new production aircraft. These values could change significantly as a function of interior configuration, aircraft service life and maintenance history. The test data you mentioned, obtained from measurements within aircraft cabins, is most likely your best source of information today.  I'm sorry we cannot meet your needs.

The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and at generic prices in Shreveport. According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989. e Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport (Generic Priced) and increased one~tenth in Bakersfield (Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period. Similar to when last reported, the share difference between the two markets appears to be due to the higher levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% _ of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion versus 20% in Shreveport. * Bakersfield’s incentives include B1GIF’s, $3 off carton purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase. The pantyhose with carton purchase and B1G1F’s continue to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition, only one store offered the free magazine with carton promotion in the generic priced market. e For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has remained relatively constant at 64%. However, distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.

RHODE II?  Department of Pathology and Microbiology and The Eppley institute, The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198  Recewved February 14, 1991; accepted May 2. 1991  We generated @ mutation in the gene for the nonstructural protein NS2 of Parvovirus H-1 in which the highly conserved dinucleotide AG at the 3' splica acceptor site of NS2 intron 1 wes mutated to CG, The mutation does not change the amino acid sequence for NS?. The splice acceptor (SA} mutant gene was introduced into the H-1 virus {H-1SA) and an infectious clone of Lulil (pLUH1SA). Tha A2 transcripts encoding NS2 were absent by both Northern blot and primer extension anelysis in the LuH1SA or H-1SA virus-infacted cells and the NS2 protein was undetectable in the infected ceil lysate by immunoprecipitation. These NS2 null mutant viruses were capable of lytic growth in cell lines that were derived from human, hamster, and dog, but they produced lower virus titers than wild-type H-1, The H.1SA virus nonproductively infected Rat2 rat fibroblasts and transformed Rat? cell lines: Analysis of synchronized infections of rat fibroblasts demonstrated thet H-1SA viral duplex replicative form ONA replication was reduced and that single-stranded progeny DNA was deficient compared to wild-type H-1.in addition, H-iSA viral protein synthesis was about 10% of wild-type virus and virions were nat detectable in rat fibroblasts. However, H-1SA mRNAs R1 and R3 accumulated to wild-type levels. NS2 was also required for productive infection in newborn rats but not in newborn hamsters. These results indicate that NS2 plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells  in vivo and in vitro, ©1991 Academic Press. Inc.  INTRODUCTION  Autonomous parvoviruses contain a linear, single- stranded (SS) DNA genome of about 5 kb. The geno- mic organization has been found to be identical among the radent parvoviruses. The viral genome encodes two overlapping transcription units; the early promoter, P4, at the left-hand end of the viral genome produces the transcripts R1 and R2 which synthesize the non- structural proteins NS1 and NS2, respectively, and the late promoter, P38, generates the R3 transcripts which are translated into the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP (Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987).  NS1 protein is coded for by a single exon and is predicted by the sequence to have a motecular weight of 76 kDa. However, NS1 migrates as several 84- to 88-kDa bands on polyacrylamide gels. The slower mo- bitty of the B8-kDa form of NS1 is due to phosphoryla- tion {Rhode and Iversen, 1990: Iversen and Rhode, 1990; Paradiso, 1984). NS1 accumulates in the nu- cleus and it is essential for viral DNA replication (Berns etal, 1988; Rhode, 1989; Tratschin ef a/., 1984: Li and Rhode, 1990), P4 and P38 promoter regulation (Labow etal, 1986; Rhode, 1985; Rhode, 1987b; Tratschin et  ‘We reported the preliminary data of tis study at the Amencan Society for Virology Annual Meeting, workshop No. 39, July 8-12,  1990. * To whom requests for reprints should be addressed.  PUBLICATIONS  V7  al, 1986), and cytotoxicity (Labow ef a/., 1987; Rhode, 19872; Li and Rhode, 1990).  NS2 is a much smaller protein with only 188 amino acids in parvovirus H-1 and migrates at 25-28 kDa on polyacrylamide gels. NS2 protein of minute virus of mice (MVM) has three isoforms (Morgan and Ward, 1986; Jongeneel ef af, 1986; Clamens er a/., 1990; Cotmore and Tattersall, 1990) and H-1 should have at least two. The major one is encoded by three exons with a large intron and 4 smail intron removed during the splicing process. Exon 1 of NS2 shares the sarne Start codon at nucleotide 264 with the NS1 gene, thus NS2 and NS1 have an identical 84 amino acids at their amino terminus; exon 2, located at the carboxyl-ter- minus of the NS 1 gene. is translated in a different read- ing frame from NS1; exon 3 encodes only 6 amino acids. The minor isoform of NS2 is produced by using an alternative splice donor and acceptor site for intron 2. Translation terminates betore its splice donor site, therefore its exon 2 is 6 amino acids longer than the major form of NS2 and there is no translated exon 3. Thus, the two isoforms of NS2 differ only by the 6 amino acids at their carboxyl-terminal end (Rhode and Iversen, 1990; Iversen and Rhode, 1990) (Fig. 1).  The function of NS2 has not been well defined. Since NS1 is essential to virus replication, it is difficult to sap- arate the gene of NS2 from NS1 and generate muta- tions in the NS2 gene without affecting the structure of NS1.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: R. Prasad ~~" "““Date: April 9, 1990  From: Cc. R. Howe and R. Southwick  Subject: Recovery of Tobacco Neutrals from Water Column Effluent  The removal of hydrophobic organic compounds from aqueous effluents is a well-known technology. For example, Bitteur and Rosset (J. Food Science  53, 141 (1988) describe the use of octadecyl-bonded silica (C-18) and styrene-divinylbenzene to recover blackcurrant aroma compounds from food plant waste water. These packings selectively retain organic compounds while inorganic salts and ionic organic compounds pass through unretained. We reasoned that the acidic water column effluent could be pumped through C- 18 packing and the organic "flavor" components could be retained while the protonated bases, e.g., nicotine, would pass through.  We have carried out an experiment to test this hypothesis (Notebook 8889-69). Specifically, to 1000g of ART MPC solution was added at room temperature 20g of Baker reversed phase packing (octadecylsilane bonded to silica gel, 40 micron particle diameter). This suspension was stirred vigorously for one hour and then filtered through a coarse fritted glass funnel. The solids (yellowish in color) were washed with two 500ml portions  of water. Nicotine analyses for the filtrate and washings were as follows:  Filtrate 27.719  lst Wash SO 675  2nd Wash .038 Total 28 .432¢  The nicotine content of the initial solution was 29.4g; thus nearly 97% of the nicotine passed through the packing.  After the second washing with water, the packing was air-dried for about 2 hours. The packing showed a weight gain of 0.25 grams. The dried packing was slurried with about 30ml 95% ethanol and filtered by suction. The packing was rinsed with two 10-ml portions of ethanol, at which point the packing was colorless. After drying the packing weighed 19.5g, probably due to mechanical loss. The yellow ethanol solution has a rich tobacco aroma and will be evaluated by the odor profile panel; it is available for subjective evaluation in cigarettes as well.  Since this result is so promising, we plan to perform additional experiments to evaluate the capacity of the C-18 packing. An alternate packing material is a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer.  We will order some of this material for studies to compare with the C- 18 data. The styrene-divinylbenzene packing can be used over a pH range of 1-14 whereas the C-18 is limited to pH 3-6 by its chemical reactivity.  SSTZtLA¢9¢ __label__Memo

Self  Vicki Lopez  Purpose  To compare True (L-11,942A) to a DORAL estron prototype (L~12,059B) among Hi-Fi non-menthol smokers.  Test Method  A paired two cigarette mall intercept test was conducted by Dwight Spencer and Associates. L-11,942A was compared to L-12,059B by 60 Hi-Fi (less than 15 mg.) smokers. These panelists were asked to rate each cigarette on ten smoking attribute statements. The scores represent a range of 1 to 7, in which 4.0 is the mean. The lower the score the greater the agreement with the statement; and the higher the score the greater the disagreement with the statement. Also, the panelists were asked for overall preference and to compare each product to their usual brand.

a EEE —_— ee     __  DRAF'?-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT~-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT—DRAFT—-DRAFT—-DRAFT  HIGHLIGHTS DATE: April 24, 1990 BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH =  Psychophysiology of Smoking - Integration of analytical chemistry data with EEG, heart rate, task-performance, and mood/feeling rating data from the 1989 EEG study was begun. Subjects were segregated into 3 groups based on  pre- to post-smoking plasma nicotine ‘rise’. Appropriate analyses of Variance are underway.  Drs. Reynolds, Robinson, and Pritchard met discuss a study to determine the optimal structure for DFC (Desire For Cigarette) measurement. Ina subsequent meeting, Drs. Robinson and Pritchard planned the detailed experimental design.  Basic Sensory Research - Evoked brain potentials, respiration, and sensory data were collected from one subject during exposure to nicotine. This session completed collection of required evoked potential data for 6 subjects. Collection of data from subject 5, an in-house volunteer, is all that remains for the completion of this phase of the work.  Mr. Roger Jennings prepared computer files of sensory attribute data on ETS chemicals from recently published reports. Sensory information on chemicals in ETS will be incorporated into a relational database that contains other information on the compounds. The data base will be used to answer end-user questions on specific chemicals or sensory characteristics.  UNIFY database software, currently on the Biobehavioral Division’s SUN computer, was evaluated by Mr. Jennings for use with the ETS data.  Dr. Jim Walker attended the 12th annual meeting of the Association of Chemoreception Sciences. He presented a paper entitled "Effects of Odorants on Respiratory Behavior and Nasal Patency." It was timely, owing to a  great deal of interest by meeting participants in the question of perceived irritation in humans. The following were noted at the meeting: an increase  in research on primate gustatory and olfactory systems, renewed interest in "taste" sensations mediated by the olfactory system, increased representation of manufacturers of fragrances and others who use fragrances to enhance product appeal, increased competition among NIH-funded chemosensory centers, increased interest in the "olfactory deficit" in Alzheimer’ Ss disease, sophisticated use of voltage-sensitive dyes and video- imaging techniques, interest in the measurement of human respiratory behavior, an increase in the number of industrial chemosensory scientists conducting psychophysical studies, an increase in the number of chemosensory scientists in consumer product R&D, and increased interest in odorant-evoked potentials.  Smoke Component Dose - Mr. Davis sought information from Dr. Brian Lawrence and Mr. Brian Smeeton (P&AT) about tea cultivation and the use of nicotine sulfate as a pesticide. Mr. Davis is preparing to survey a number of teas for potential nicotine content. We and others have observed nicotine in teas previously.  Nicotine Receptor Pharmacology - Dr. Eric Fluhler continued to characterize     the effects of nicotine on calcium flux in synaptosomes prepared from adult ~~  rat brain. Results indicate that micromolar concentrations of nicotine Significantly increase intrasynaptosomal concentrations of calcium. Modulation of calcium levels is thought to help regulate the release of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals in vivo. The abilities of several  f8OG 66L4G __label__Report

Immunoglobulin E Receptor Cross-linking Induces Oscillations in Intracellular Free Ionized Calcium in Individual Tumor Mast Cells*  ‘Received for publication, June 5, 1989)  Paul J. Millardt§, Timothy A. Ryan, Watt W. Webbj, and Clare Fewtrellt From the {Department of Pharmacology, WDepartment of Physics, and the | School of Applied and Engineering Physics,  Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853  Fura-2 fluorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia cells was monitored to study the rise in intracellular free ionized calcium ([Ca*]) produced by aggregation of immunoglobulin E receptors. Repetitive transient increases in (Ca**],; were induced by antigen stimula- tion and were measured using digital video imaging microscopy at high time resolution. The {Ca?*], oseil- lations were not dependent upon changes in the mem- brane potential of the cells and were observed in cells stimulated with antigen either with or without extra- cellular Ca**. Transient oscillations in [Ca2*]; were also observed when calcium influx was blocked with La®*. These results suggested that during antigen stimula- tion of cells under normal physiological conditions, release of Ca** from intracellular stores makes an im- portant contribution to the initial increase in [Ca?*},, Oscillations in [Ca?*]; are not induced by elevating [Ca’*], with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mito- chondrial calcium buffering is not required for [Ca?*], oscillations to occur. The results show that rat baso- philic leukemia cells have significant stores of calcium and that release of calcium from these stores can par-  ticipate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in [Ca**],.  rr rr  Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)' cells are a tumor mast cell line that responds to stimuli that aggregate surface receptors for immunoglobulin E (IgE), generating a large rise in intra- cellular free ionized calcium ({Ca**],) and ultimately resulting in secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. It has long been known that Ca** plays a critical role in the  initiation and control of secretory behavior in many different eee  * This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grants DCB 8702584, DIR 8716854 (to C.

Furthermore, studies in mast cells using Ca’* ionophores have established a causal relationship between the increase in [Ca**], and secretion (1, 2). Changes in (Ca?*], in RBL cells have largely been attributed to the influx of Ca2* from the extracellular medium (3-6). However, the involve- ment of releasable calcium stores in the control of cellular processes has been documented in many cell types, and cal- cium stores have recently been implicated in the generation of elevated [Ca’*}, in RBL cells? (5, 7, 8). Indeed, stores are sufficient to supply enough calcium to support much of the early phase of the rise in [Ca], in these cells (5).  Digital video imaging of fluorescent indicators has been used to study changes in [Ca**], in a number of different cell types (9-18) including RBL cells (19). Current studies by us and by others have shown remarkable differences between the measurements of [Ca’*], in populations of cells and those obtained from the individual cells that comprise the popula- tion. In our early work (19), the [Ca?*]; responses of individual RBL cells stimulated by cross-linking surface IgE receptors were found to be preceded by lag times of variable length; once initiated, the rise in [Ca’*]; was much more rapid than might be predicted from fluorometric studies with cell suspen- sions. It has been observed that [Ca’*], in different types of cells stimulated with a variety of agonists fluctuates markedly (20), sometimes in concert with repetitive spiking of the membrane potential (21-24). Because of technical restrictions frequently associated with digital video microscopy, high time resolution measurements of [Ca’*]; have often been carried out using one cell at a time. Significant improvement of the temporal resolution of [Ca]; imaging measurements has allowed us to record simuitaneously the marked, frequently oscillating increases of [Ca’*], in many stimulated RBL cells.  In this study, we have begun to characterize the (Ca?*]; oscillations, to identify their source, and to determine what cellular components are involved in their control. We have found that oscillations in [Ca’*‘]; can still occur when the membrane potential is clamped and do not require calcium influx from the extracellular solution. The [Ca?"], oscillations  appear to occur as the result of modulation of [Ca**]; by exchange with intracellular stores.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell Preparation—Rat basophilic leukemia cells of the secreting subline 2H3 (25) were cultured as described previously (26). Cells were removed from flasks by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) in a calcium- and magnesium-free saline solution. Sensitization by incubation with a monoclonal IgE directed against the dinitrophenyl hapten was carried out in Eagle's minimal essential medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10 mM Na-HEPES and 20% newborn bovine serum (GIBCO).

They are not intended to represent necessarily the priority topics that all of the involved agencies and individuals working toward the Year 2000 will ultimately agree to address.  "BRAINSTORMING" PROCEDURES  The four topics will be briefly overviewed by David Burns, M.D. "Brainstorming" begins after the first morning break.  There will be 30 minutes to brainstorm each of the four topics. Each of the four facilitators will elicit fran the Work Group participants ideas for priority issues within the four general topics.  The objective of each thirty-minute session is to generate as many ideas as possible. :  It will not be necessary to either prioritize or evaluate the many ideas produced regarding each topic.  The Work Group will prioritize the issues generated during the "brainstomming" sessions after the second morning break. Typed copies of the issues/ideas generated in the four sessions will be distributed to all Work Group participants for their use in this prioritizing session.       PETS 69LOS __label__Report

The investigator's specific aim is to examine the role of alpha antitrypsin (a, AT) deficiency as a risk factor in the development of  chronic airway obstruction. The hypotheses to be tested are that  a) MZ heterozygote for a,AT deficiency has impaired lung function as measured by a wide range of tests of lung mechanics and  b) the MZ heterozygote does not belong to the high risk category for the development of chronic airway obstruction unless there is an  additive factor such as smoking, pollutants etc.  In view of the unusual population available and her expertise, I recommend continuation at high priority.

Time-Out is still a great magazine for the brand and so are all the others mentioned below. All the other books mentioned below should also stay on plan and have more Camel and Kamel impact. By leaving these books I am only raising Marlboro's share of voice. I will be fired or I should quit if New York share for Camel and Kamel does not grow. I have to have better, more impactful advertising.  Salem has a great challenge ahead, but the ONLY thing that will work for Salem is having more impactful creative. Having Mela - Alem on billboards and POS means nothing along with the ORB which has no equity. To suggest taking the foot off the pedal for Camel and Winston with strong equities to make room for Mela - Alem and the Orb is absolutly wrong. New York if anything needs more Camel impact.

Research Department  MEMORANDUM September 2, 1971  NEW_IMPACT STANDARDS /715 MEV LoD  A new series of impact standards has been developed and recently reported by R&DE, Southampton(!), Although the Southampton approach was expected to be an improvemant over the chemical standards, we felt that BéW's needs would still not be met by these new standards. Consequently, we have been pursuing the development of our own series. Preliminary results are quite encouraging.  This memo covers my comments on the Southampton Report and the status of our developmental work.     O6-R     Ad Comments on R&DE Report Ri  Jeremy Wood's report contains several points of immediate importance in view of on-going WOODROSE activities and current R&D projects.  1. The new series of nine impact standards are designed to give more precise determinations than the previous standards, covering the same impact sensation range (0 to 4 is now 1 to 9).  2. The filter cigarettes are available from R&DE and Wood makes the recommendation that the new standards be used by all panels using WOODROSE .  3. Very casually in passing, Wood makes the comment that impact "should be based on the whole cigarette and not merely on the first few puffs." This is news to me.     The new series is based on the relationship between extractable nicotine delivery and impact. The desired levels of impact sensation are produced by blends of two flue-cured tobaccos, widely differing in nicotine concent, in proportions to yield theoretical nicotine deliveries, which give just noticeable differences (j.n.d.) in impact. Calculations for the tobacco blend formulations are based on the theory that the difference between two stimuli is what is important in determining j.n.d. and net absolute values,  The impact standards, identified as IMP/1, IMP/2...IMP/9, were evaluated by “blind” panel testing. Ten members scored, by the old scale, adjacent pairs from memory, i.e., no standards were used. The panel average re- sults ranged from 0.56 for IMP/1 to 3.50 for IMP/9 with all samples falling in the "carrect" sequence. However, for three of the adjacent pairs,     Diooe, D.

FIELD MARKETXNG MANAGER MEDIA GUIDELINES  When contacted by a reporter, field marketing managers should forward calls to the public relations staff. You  should also contact your RJR Marketing contact.  If reporter insists that he/she needs to talk with a local RJR representative, field marketing manager should respond  that his/her responsibility is field marketing support, not media relations. PR staff in Winston-Salem will support  field marketing managers by emphasizing to reporter that managers are not prepared to represent the company's view on all issues.  If approached by a television crew, field marketing manager should stop all sampling procedures. Do not cause an uproar -- simply cease all sampling activities quietly.  All other events should continue as scheduled, with age verification particularly stringent.  Be aware that some news crews or photographers will "plant" underage children near the activity, appearing as if they are waiting to participate. The field marketing manager is responsible for politely moving along such clearly underage people.  It is preferable for announcements of RJR donations, sponsorships, etc., to be made by the recipient organization on their letterhead. However, before an organization sends out a news release on an RJR contribution, sponsorship or other involvement, the field marketing manager must send that release to Public Relations for approval before it is released. The same applies to any photos/captions being provided to the media.  CC6QS  T6o0e __label__Report
oa)  Souilbeengl, TOBACCO COMPANY:  MEMORANDUM January 2, 1991  TO:: FF. J. Schultz FROM: S. 8S. Miller  SUBJECT: Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes  Direction was given to develop a modified Newport cigarette with "low ignition propensity" properties that smoked equal to the control. Prior work by A. M. Ihrig) and C. I. Lewis showed that a blend containing between 30% and 50% expanded tobacco and a cigarette paper having a Coresta value between 9 and 11 would result in a cigarette having the: desirable “low ignition" properties. Although these modifications. gave the desired “low ignition" properties the cigarettes smoked very bland and were undesirable when compared to a control Newport..  A blend containing 30% Burley/Flue: cured P.T. with increased casing and. recasiing was developed to make the modified cigarette smoke comparable to a control Newport. This combination in addition to the low Coresta. cigarette paper yielded approximately a 35-40% increase in CPM. Higher filtration and air dilution was incorporated to reduce the CPM to the control. level.  Old Gold. and Golden Light "low ignition propensity" cigarettes were also developed using the same: blend, casing and recasing modifications.  Based on the Product Development. panel tests the test. samples were found comparable tio the controls.  When this project was started it was. referred to as. “Self Extinguishing Cigarettes" Project B-337. As of December, 1990 this project will be referred to as “Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes," Project B-337.  Fabric ignition testing was done to determine if the test cigarettes after all combined modifications were made, still exibited low ignition properties. Also a series of analytical tests were run. to determine if the smoke: chemistry had. changed.  SULST6ELS __label__Memo

Nearly two years ago in this paper I reported on the advertizing blitzes and media campaigns of American cigaretle companies here (“Welcome to Marlboro Country: the new Transylvania”, Jan. 25, 1996.)

After all, wasn't President Clinton encouraging initiatives to decrease smoking, especially among youth?  Whatever Congress or the White House may or may not have done, our tobacco companies’ efforts in Eastern Europe and Romania have reached phenomenal proportions, and more and more people -- especially the young --  are smoking more than ever before.  We have here a public health epidemic. There is virtually no education about the dangers of smoking: Even the doctors smoke.

vee ee ee ee ee re meee cent oe oe nee ete | 4  Siate of Immunity And Personality  Tied to Cancer  Medical Tribune Report CAREFREE, ArRIz,.—The role of the emo- tional state in association with malignant disease has recently been sharpened to an extent that enables a delineation of the “cancer-prone personality.”  And what ultimately makes him sus- ceptible to cancer may be a psychologi- cally triggered alteration in his immune defense.  Both views, and some supporting ex- periments, were reported here at the 13th annual Science Writers Seminar of the American Cancer Society.  The personality sketch was described by Claus Bahnson, Ph.D., senior research scientist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psy- chiatric Institute in Philadelphia, who for more than 10 years has been testing and interviewing hundreds of cancer patients for comparison with normal persons and, more recently, with coronary patients and  Medical Tribune May 5, 1971  patients with a variety of other somatic diseases.  In general, he said, the cancer patient represses all unpleasant “affect states,” such as anxiety, depression, hostility, or guilt, much more effectively than nor- mals or other sick persons do. As might be deduced from that, the cancer pa- tient feels the least stress in his job, re- cent stress of any kind, or psychic anxiety and is furthest from the “pat- tern A” associated with myocardial in- farction (competitive, restless, anxiety- laden).  From childhood the typical cancer pa- tient recalls a life that was “bleak and un- satisfying,” remembering mother as un- loving and unprotecting and father as un- protecting and undemanding. The upshot is a person who conforms to social norms, living “a formal, realistic, and common- sense—oriented effective social and family life unrelated to his basic needs for affec- tion, warmth, and personal creativity.”  “The cancer patient is a nice guy,” Dr. Bahnson said, and has great difficulty deal- ing with or expressing anger.  Subjected to statistical analysis, the “projection score” data on cancer patients compared with normals and patients with other ills indicated the cancer patients’ re- pression of emotions was significantly greater than normals for all indices and greater than that of any other patient in all indices except guilt, where there was no meaningful difference between cancer, coronary, and other sick patients.  Dr. Bahnson said he currently is work- ing with cancer specialists and immunolo- gists in an effort to pin down a relationship between affect and stress states and im- mune reactions in cancer patients com- pared with normals. As it stands now, -he said, on a purely empiric basis it should be possible to screen psychologically a ran- dom group of people and accomplish a 30 per cent improvement in forecasting which members of the group are most likely to develop cancer.

eS > foo Hogh RIR Interoffice Memorandum Faget 72/9  Contact Cement  Subject: Use of Weldwood Date: February 29, 1988 (egy Copy  To: Mr. Richard J. Hal} From: Or. Rob Harrington  Below is an evaluation of Weldwood Contact Cement manufactured by DAP, Inc. (Dayton, OH). Scientific Affairs approves the use of this product to secure gaskets to apron dryer doors. Product contact with this adhesive should be kept to a minimum. This adhesive contains solvents that may cause dizziness, headache and other health effect. Proper ventilation and the use  of rubber gloves are recommended when applying this adhesive.  This adhesive is composed of neoprene rubber in a 1,1,1 trichloroethane/ dichloromethane base.  Chloroprene rubber (neoprene or latex) is a polymer made from chloroprene monomers, It 1s commonly used to waterproof rubber materials such as gloves, coatings, belts, tires, etc, Chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene) is a color- less flammable liquid with a high vapor pressure. Jn chronic Studies with mice and rats, chloroprene monomer was determined not to be carcinogenic. It is not considered to be a teratogen. Chloroprene is a respiratory tract irri- tant. At very high levels it can cause respiratory depression and asphyxia.  At levels above 300 ppm chloroprene can produce toxic effects. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set a threshold  limit value (TLV) of 10 ppm for exposure in the workplace. Polychloroprene rubber is essentially non toxic. It has an average molecular weight of  100,000. These polymers often contain sulfur. Pyrolysis products of the monomer or polymer include hydrogen chloride (HC1), sulfur dioxide (S09), car-  bon monoxide (CO) and small amounts of chloroprene, benzene, acetic ac mic acid, formaldehyde and various mercaptans.  1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) is a clear nonflammable liquid with a very high vapor pressure. It has a low oral toxicity with an LD (le- thal dose to 50% of the test population) of approximately 8 g/kg (ACGIH, Documentation of Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices, 1986). It may also be absorbed through the skin. Contact with methyl chloro- form readily de-fats the skin and may Cause redness and scaling. Inhalation exposures to 500 ppm for 7 hours a day for 6 months did not cause any adverse effects in rats, rabbits or monkeys. High concentrations may cause anesthesia and levels above 15,000 ppm may be fatal. It is not considered to be a car-  cinogen or a teratogen. Due to its low toxicity, the ACGIH has set a TLV of 350 ppm in the workplace.  Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) is a colorless, highly volatile liquid. It 4s used in paint removers, solvents, and degreasing agents.

Role Title of Original Grant: Modulation of nicotine-receptor channels  Abstract of the Specific Aims as stated in the original application:  Aim 1: Modulation of post synaptic nicotine-activated channels subtypes.  Aim 1 of the original application propased to asess the differences amongst native neuronal nAChR subtypes with respect to which subtypes are subject to modulation and which nAChR @ subunits are required for modulation. We proposed to examine the single channel properties and modulation of nAChRs on primary neurons and then compare the behaviour of native nAChRs with those expressed by "subunit deleted" neurons (i.e. neurons treated with subunit-specific antisense oligonucleotides). This analysis was to be complemented by studies of the modulation of nicotine activated channels made up of particular « and B nAChR subunit cDNAs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes.  i : Role of presynaptic nicotine receptors in th: tion of synaptic  Experiments in Aim 2 were to examine the role of presynaptic nicotine receptor channels in the modulation of synaptic function. Our preliminary experiments suggested that nicotine might augment the release of fast excitiatory transmitters. We proposed that different subtypes of nAChRs might mediate nicotine-induced synaptic facilitation, perhaps dependent on the targetting of specific subtypes to terminal fields receiving co-incident cholinergic input. Aim 2 experiments proposed to extend our preliminary findings by examination of both the molecular mechanism(s) and nicotine receptor subtypes responsible for synaptic modulation in the CNS.

a  —_ ATTACHMENT C     TO: D. Dangoor DATE: February 16, 1990  FROM: N. Lund  SUBJECT: Marlboro Ultra Lights  This provides an alternative to our February lst testing plan for  Marlboro Ultra Lights. We recommend replacing the original proposal with a plan to open new test market(s) with alternate packaging,  (soft), and marketing programs highly targeted to competitive smokers.  Rationale for this direction is discussed below. Rich’s recommendation is attached. It provides more detailed support and begins to sketch out the new plan.     Brand developed a plan to increase competitive conversion and restore Lights growth trend in the current test markets. While the plan would likely achieve these objectives, full costing out of the  programs discloses a spending level so high as to raise serious questions about expandability and projectability of results. This  factor, combined with several strategic issues outlined below, lead us to a recommendation to abandon development of the Phase II plan in current test markets. We believe we can generate new, perhaps more  relevant, learning through new test market(s).  TEST MARKET RESULTS SUMMARY  Performance in three test markets suggests Marlboro Ultra Lights is likely to achieve a 1.2 ~ 1.4 share of market, contributing however only +.3 incremental share points to PM and +.5 to Marlboro. Further, the entry is not demonstrating growth and Marlboro Lights has been destabilized. While nearly 60% of converters fall within our 25-44 year old target, smokers fall disproportionately to the younger end of that target.  STRATEGIC ISSUES Ideal Ultra Launch Timing/Implications  Brand believes Marlboro Ultra Lights should ideally be launched when such a launch would add significant on-going growth for the brand.  We believe that two factors would make for the ideal launch environment: 1) a vital ultra category defined by accelerated growth and/or 2) a slow down in Marlboro Lights growth trend. Accelerated category growth could result from heightened health/social concerns and/or a marketplace destabilized by the introduction of a  revolutionary product.  SOISICTH IG __label__Memo

SWITZERLAND  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  To: K Schmidt Date: 21 October, 1999 From: E. de Borst cc: MAS, JAG, AKA, TEB, GAE.  Subject: PROJECT PALOMINO  Recommendation  Reference is made to the attached subjective evaluation results, which were very conclusive and in favor of a total elimination of both urea and ammonia  rather than urea only.  For all blends in the EU region we, therefore, recommend to discontinue the usage of RLB and BL, in favor of the utilisation of RLE and Cast Leaf.  Implementation considerations and strategy  1. Priority will be given to production for Norway. As of the November 99- production, implement the ML PE blend with CL and RLE for FF, MED and Lights in MUG/FTR. There is no impact on tobacco weight. For Merit and Merit Ultra, production at FTR, the project Hill blend standardisation using CL/RLE is recommended. It should be noted that also production of CH Domestic and Duty Free are to follow to ensure sufficient volumes to use full batches of filler. A weight saving is foreseen. Sufficient cast leaf to support this production will be supplied ex Bremen to FTR.  2. Second priority will be given to production for UK. In view of production volumes and availability of cast leaf, production can only begin in  S8PZ6PEL0z __label__Memo

S CALCULATIONS FASED UPOH & PUBLISHED REVIEW OF AVERAGE  SECONDHAND SMOKE:  HOW MUCH ARE NON-SMOKERS  EXPOSED TO?  With all the discussion today about second- hand smoke, you may be interested in how much you are exposed to.  The answer, in our opinion, is very little. Expressing exposure to secondhand smoke in terms of cigarette equivalents is one way to gain a perspective. For example:  1} In a month, a non-smoker fiving with a smoker would, on average, be exposed to second- hand smoke equivalent to smoking approximately (vs cigarettes?  2) {na month, a non-smoking waiter who works eight hours a day, five days a week in a restaurant would, on the average, be exposed to  _ Secondhand smoke equivalent to smoking about 2 cigarettes?  3) In a month in a modern office where smok- ing was permitted, a non-smoker sharing an office with a smoker would, on average, be exposed tothe equivalent of smoking about I'4 cigaretces*  There are many ways to calculate cigarette equivalents, and no method exactly predicts the precise amount of secondhand smoke a non-  smoker is exposed to. Also, cigarette equivalent calculations are-  THE HAGNITUOE OF SECONDHAND SHORE EXPOSURE. USE       SMOKING AREA MEASUREHENTS OF NICOTINE -ONE OF SHE COMPOHENTS (OF OTHER COMPOUNDS MAY GIVE DWFFERENT ACSLATS, AND AN WIDIVIDUAL'  not necessarily relevant to an assessment of the potential risk from secondhand smoke.  In our opinion, secondhand smoke is not the same as the smoke a smoker inhales.  ‘What we are saying is that there are always two sides to every argument. Both sides need to be heard and evaluated in order to make an informed decision.  ‘We believe that the solution to most smoking issues can be found in accommodation. There are ways for smokers and non-smokers to co-exist peacefully. And we encourage discussion that will help solve the issues without resorting to Govern- ment intervention. Clearly common sense should tell everyone not to expose very young children to high levels of secondhand smoke.  As it relates to smokers, in our opinion smoking is a risk factor for certain diseases. At Rj.Reynolds we believe the choice to smoke shoutd be made only by adults.  This opinion is brought to you in the inter- ests of an informed debate by the R,].Reynolds Fobacco Company. For further information please call 1-800-366-8441.  TOGETHER, WE CAN WORK IT OUT  USED BY HANY RESLARCHERS TO DEVELOP A SEHSE OF ‘§ ACTUAL EKPOSURE MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.     Z8@9 692TS __label__Advertisement

REVIEW & OUTLOOK Rethinking Risk     When the new Republican Con- gress convenes in January, one of the top priorities ought to be relling back what Lamar Alexander calls the “Waxman State’’—the torrent of rues and reguiations enacted into law by the likes of Congressman Henry Wax- man (D., Hollywood}. This is an espe- cially pressing priority in the environ- mental arena, where Congress and various executive branch agencies have spent years passing onerous rules to deal with negligible or nonex- istent risks.  Environmental regulation is the source of much public outrage nowa- days. Often the rules are a tangled meéss because Congress's underlying  legisiation vas complex in its goals °  and impossibly vague in how to meet those goals. The real rule-making was left to the bureaucracies, which in (urn produced their own Rube Gold- bergian complexity. Now comes evi- dence from a most unlikely source— the government itself~to support the contention that environmental spend- ing bears little if any relation to the real risks faced dy the public.  —» The Department of Energy has  just released a report titled ‘“‘Choices in Risk Assessment,’ prepared by a Nonprofit Teseareh group. The agency has good reason to study the subject: It could spend $300 billion to S1 trillion over the next 36 years cleaning up waste sites. Does the sci- entific policy behind those cleanups— and other federal actions—stand up to scrutiny?  The report delivers some clear an- swers: ‘Most environmental risks are so smail or indistinguishable that their existence cannot be proven,” Scientific policy is “inherently biased and can be designed to achieve prede- términed regulatory outcomes.'’ “‘Pol- i¢ymakers, the media and the public are unaware of the role of science pol- iey because of a lack of full and fair @sclosure.”"  * Consider just one example: the Oc- cupational Safety and Eealth Admin- istration is now proposing sweeping indoor air-quality regulations that would inciude a ban on all workplace smoking. But according to “Choices,"* a-major part of this policy—estimated to.cost the private sector $8 billion an- oally—is based on a one-page, hand- written chart that has never been pub- lished or peer-reviewed.  The “Chaices'' report praises the government for not banning the fluo-  ridation of water, unleaded gasoline ! and used oil. for which some evidence | of risk exists, but which on balance do far more good than harm, The report asks why similar decisions haven’t been reached about other alleged dan- gers. For example, when the EPA tried to ban asbestos, it took into ac- count only the product’s hypothetical! cancer risk—not the many lives that would be lost if nonasbestos brakes are substituted on cars,  There's simply no rhyme or reason behind federal environmental policy. £ven the ‘one chance in a million” standard used by many agencies to define a minimum level of cancer risk turns out to have mo scientific basis. Kathryn Kelly, a Seattle environmen- tal consultant, reports in the newslet- ter EPA Watch that this standard was basically plucked out of a hat by the FDA in the 1970s to regulate animal drug residues. Now it's employed for everything from hazardous waste sites to pesticides—even though scien- tists have generaily concluded that risks of Iess than one in a thousand can’t even be quantified. i  ‘It’s insane that we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars chasing imagined risks,"* Steve Milloy, author of.“Choices,” tells us.  The road to sanity starts with more rational risk/cost-benefit analysis. Bills to accomplish that goal were in- troduced in the last Congress but got nowhere because of opposition from Democratic barons. Now that there are new Kings of the Hill, swift action is expected on this front.  But the new Republican majority     should be careful about the language ‘be  of cost-benefit bills. As “Choices” points out, many risk-analysis ideas have already been implemented via executive order—to no effect. What's needed ts legislation with teeth—set out clearly what standards bureau- crats should follow, and give compa- : nies and focal governments the right to sue if regulators get out of line. GOP Sen. Trent Lott. the new Majority Whip. has introduced a draft proposal along these lines, and Rep. Dan Mica (R., Fla.) will probably follow suit.  Passage of their plans would be a first step toward dismantling the | crushing cost burden of the Waxman State, which surely played aroleinthe ! voters’ recent decision to part ways with the Democratic Party.

July 1, 1992  Key Points:  Q  Dr. DiFranza, a principal author of the JAMA studies, has said, “None of these studies were designed to show that these Camel ade increased smoking among kids.*  Joe Camel and Mickey Mouse were not equally recognized in the total study.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza has admitted to bias and research manipulation in his work that purports Camel hag 32% of youth smokers.  Youth smoking is on the decline in the U.S., while youth disapprovabeof smoking is increasing. -  Recognition of advertising does not translate drito usage or changed attitudes about smoking.  The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that  teen smoking can be reduced by as much as 50% through compliance with existing minimumeage laws.  Background facts:  The statement Joe Camel is as well recognized as Mickey Mouse 4s one of the most incorrect headlines in this controvarsy. The article shows that 91.7% of the 229 kids in the study recognized Mickey Mouse as the Disney logo, 51.1% recognized Joe Camel as a cigarette illustration -- a  40-point gap. The 23 6-year-olds in the study came closer to recognizing the two equally, but 23 kida in one school - are in no way representative of the entire U.S., and the ~ flawed methodology of the survey affected this result. Also, recognition does not change the negative recognition kids have about smoking.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza, the principal author of the article on Canel's share of the youth market, has admitted to the press that there is bias and manipulation in his research on Camel. The purpose of his work, ha says, was to "give us a couple of smoking guns to bring to the media." He has acknowledged that, "None of thease studies were designed to show that these Camel ada increased smoking among kida." He outlined the final article more than a year before its publication, writing a research colleague, "There, the paper 6 ail ready. Now all we need ia some data."  LOC H2STS __label__Report

- PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC, _ INTER-OFFICE  CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592  To: Hans Storr Date: September 1, 1993  From: Barry Holt Subject: Media Request -- CAPITAL (France)  As you'll remember from my previous memo, Eric Wattez, a  reporter with the French business monthly Capital, is writing a cover story on Philip Morris Companies Inc. He would like to  interview you sometime between September 9-15 or after September 20.  Background:  Capital is the leading French economic/business magazine. It is published by the Prisma Group and has ties with the German group, Gruener & Jahr, which publishes the German edition of  Capital.  The French Capital was introduced in October 1991 and met with immediate success. It surpassed the then-leading French economic  monthly, L'Expansion. Today, Capital's circulation has reached almost 300,000.  Capital employs somewhat unusual angles: it tries to ‘humanize’ its stories, making the economy and business readable and appealing to everybody.  Capital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page story to a large company which is in the news because of its success (or failure.) Mr. Wattez  is preparing such a story on PM -- as an example of success. He has already interviewed Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael  Horst (EC) and Ray Viault (Jacobs Suchard). He has also seen PM sponsorship in action by attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand  Prix.  ¥999999%  , +  ry ¢ __label__Memo

Are you all OK with the use of the words "flavorant" and "processing aids." What about "formulation aids"?  Enciosed is tha next draft.  Two portions are highlighted, both of which could ba ramoved. Regarding the second portion (alking about rate of absorption), this comes from our answer to Markey, with references, plus a direct response to the Pankow claims. Aerosols are not mentioned; vapor phase is. The inclusion of a discussion about rate is necessary only if the audience receiving this is sophisticated enough to understand the issues. Certainly, we do rot want to provide a complex answer which confuses folks, when a simply one would work.  << File: Markey_Dempsey_references_draft.doc >>  VOECEZTPELO™ __label__Email

Kabat  Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine Albert Einstein College of Medicine  Belfer Building Rm. 1302  1300 Morris Park Avenue  Bronx, NY 10461-1601  Dear Dr, Kabat:  I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL. Am. J. Epidemiol. 142(2):141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely  indicates a minor error.  Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in childhood as 0.90 for “yes” (i.e., any exposure), 1.12 for “1 smoker in the household,” and 1.13 for “2+ smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the OR’s for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is, unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe, be incorrect.  I calculated crude OR’s and CI’s from your published case and control counts for each exposure category and was surprised to find that the crude results for “yes/no” identically replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142 that “[u}nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2 contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state if the results in Table 2 are, or are not, adjusted. My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household” was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2,06) and for “2+ smokers in the household” was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.31-2.45), These calculated crude sub-category results are logically consistent with the published, dichotomous “yes/no” results.  wrk for smokers.”     C862 LSLTS __label__Letter

Last year, three million people started to smoke.  This year, the criticism will continue. And next year, too. Butafter all is said and done, another three million people will probably start smoking.  Maybe the people who criticize smoking should stare the facts in the face. Then they might recommend that if you've decided to smoke, but are concerned about ‘tar’ and nicotine, you might smoke Vantage.  Vantage offers smokers the rich, tobacco flavor they've come to appreciate. Witha substantial cut in ‘tar’ and nicotine.  So if you're one of those smokers who is now deciding between high ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes that taste good, and Tow tar and nicotine cigarettes that taste like nothing, you might appreciate Vantage.  Because Vantage is both high in flavor and low in ‘tar’ and nicotine.  That's why so many people who have smoked for many years have switched to Vantage.  And that’s why, if you've just started to smoke this year, we suggest you try Vantage yourself.                        ©)  VANTAGE      > OB San ~ Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking ts Dangerous to Your Health. _. . _. .

RJ REYNOLDS INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  SUBJECT: Irritation Test 9 DATE: March ‘26, 1985" Percent Wet Particulate Matter : Aed. | To: File FROM: Saniel Kurtz BACKGROUND  This study was designed to examine the shape of the psychophysical curve relating perceived sidestream smoke attribute magnitude to the percent wet particulate matter left in the sidestream smoke. Previous studies have examined the effect of total removal of particulate matter and include Irritation Tests 1,2,3 and & (report on Irritation Test 6 will be forthcomming).  METHODS  Testing was similar to that reported by Gayle Ryan in SED Test Report No. API.  CAMEL LIGHT 85's were chosen on the basis of draft (12.2 to 13.4 cm H20) and % air dilution (27% to 34%), Product manipulation was as follows:  + 92.5% WIPM - filter holder without filter  » SS.5% WPM ~ filter with two fat short tubes.  34.6% WIPM - filter with one fat short tube.  17.5% WIPM - filter with one long skinny tube.  15.5% WIPM - filter with no dilution tubes.  MmooODD>  The filter holder was placed directly above the smoking chamber with  the aid of a Delryn connector. A similar connector was placed on top of the filter holder to which a Teflon Tee was attached. Also to this were the dilution air and the exit tube to the soliniod box.  The method for callibrating the filter pads is described in Appendix a.  fs in prior tests Gayle Ryan was responsible for subject performance evaluations and statistical analysis. Ruth Webb and Saundra Jacobs shared the responsibilities for arranging test schedules, running the  test and data entry  Evaluations were performed on 9 sensory attributes (attachment 1) using unstructured line scales (attachment 2).

It ig indeed heartening that at long last scientific evicence is  -available to show the harmful effects of passive smoke on non smokers.  We have done vesearch on less harmful effects of cigarettes for the non smoker and the smoker himself for over 20 years, The results of our research have produced a number of patents which have a major effect of reducing the sidestream smoke to almost zero, thus removing the very dangers to the lungs of the non smoker. St ae  You have stated "I think the protection of human health is very important. I'm one who really detests legislation, but I wouldn't have any idea how to protect non smokers without some type of legislation", We have this answer.  Our developments in this area are based on coating the cigarette paperwith a well known, safe compound which has been documented over the years to be clear, tasteless, odorless, inert, non carcinogenic and non ellergenic, releasing only a small amount of water vapor into the smoke stream. - - - ,  The applied compound forms an insulating cover over the puraing | eoal which, in turn, slows the burning rate of the cigarette between  puffs, without interfering with the quantity, guality and taste of the puff, .  The state of California has tested our cigarette development for its properties of fire resistance, Enclosed is a copy of their report.  The Department of Hoalth, Education and Welfaro tested an earlier version of our cigarette devolopmont with test results showing about 20% less "tars", nicotine and carbon monoxide in the mainstream amoke and about 60% lesa "tars", nicotine and certain gases in tho sidostream smoke.

Box 1556  Little Rock, AR 72203  Dear Maurice,  The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S. Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation would affect just about everyplace except one’s home.  The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact. While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your members.  It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As lam certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.  Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.     TI1632-1601 __label__Letter

PROJECT SUMMARY: -  Be brief-200 word maximum: (Include Objective, Approach, / . ~ Current Plans and/or . Progress) Analytical methods will be developed to separate the naturally occur- i ring stereoisomer 1-nicotine from d-nicotine. Attempts to. accomplish this { will involve the use of high performance liquid and capillary gas chromato— i . eraphic columns with stationary phases containing optically pure chiral i @ groups. Another approach to be investigated involves the interactions of t nicotine with various optically. pure chiral acids and separations of the re- . sulting diastereomeric ion pairs by liquid chromatography. A less attrac } tive possibility involves chemical modification of nicotine by an efficient | nonstereoselective process to a species which can besconverted to diastereo~ { meric derivatives. The resulting derivatives might be separable by liquid | or gas chromatographic techniques. Once suitable chromatographic methods ! ‘have been developed for the ‘micro-scale analyses of d- and i-nicotine, ‘studies will be initiated to accurately determine the degree of conversion of the natural l-isomer to its enantiomer during the burning of tobacco.  The comparative metabolism of d- and 1-nicotine will also be investigated in rats and mice following administration of the racemic compound. In addi~ tion, methods will ‘be’ developed for preparative-scale chromatographic separ~ ations of the enantiomers of nicotine and nornicotine. :     50168370 __label__Report

ANALYST IMPRESSIONS  I listened to several impromptumedia interviews of Analysts. In general, the Analysts' answers were precise, low-key and  favorable about the development.  They also refused to speculate on questions designed to  elicit a negative and/or controversial response.  John of the Wall Street Journal asked one analyst if this  product failed would it “be like the introduction of new.  Coke?" the answer was:  "Of course not; Coke withdrew a product and RJR is not doing that. Also this is nowhere near the same level of spending  and commitment.  Another analyst said it "is a good move because RJR has nothing to lose here. It's a technological advancement and  that puts them on the leading edge. But, if it doesn't fly  they have really not invested that much.  ui °o a _ wn Ww w ~ oO __label__Report
PROJECT 2302 IMPROVED SMOKE FLAVOR  PERIOD COVERED BY REPORT: August. 18 ~ September 16, 1960 DATE CF REPORT: September 26, 1960 PROJECT LEADER: W. H. Danker  PROPYLENE GLYCOL IN! FILLER FOR SMOKE MILDNESS.  A study has been under way for several months to determine the maximum amount of propylene glycol we could add to fillers without staining the paper. Both Alpine and Philip Morris  cigarettes are being tested - at room temperature and at elevated  temperatures. A range of from 4%. to 8% propylene glycol is  being used in the study, The 8 samples show paper spotting within a month. The 6% samples show a slight amount of spotting on Philip Morris cigarettes. andi frequent spotting on Alpine ciga- rettes in 2 months. The 4% samples show spotting only at 110°F after 1 month; samples stored at 75°F did not spot in 1 month. ,  Analysis of propylene glycol has been recently made relatively much more reliable and show much variation in application of propylene glycol on filler. Therefore future panel studies: will be more meaningful when accompanied by analytical data. Our studies will continue until firm results are determined correlating percentage propylene glycol, spott-~ ing and reduction in irritation,  In the event. that spotting does occur at a propylene @lycol level which is threshold for irritation, Mr. J. W. Geiger has a paper which has shown no spotting at. the higher levels of propylene glycol in filler.  SIMULTANEOUS EVALUATIONS OF FLAVOR. AND IRRITATION  We have completed the first of a basic series of studies on changes of flavor and irritation with changes in concentra- tion of three flavors and of smoke. The four materials selected to show a wide range of difference in flavor and in irritation, were furan, acrolein, anethole and whole Philip Morris cigarette smoke. Sensory evaluation results show strikingly different patterns for each of these materials with change of concentra- tion in air dilutions. Furan's flavor increases. faster than does its irritation with Increasedi concentration. By contrast the reverse is true for acrolein, Irritation inereases faster  Cc C6G-82322  se burtgy ee  et te kode Wl  gogahecen¢ __label__Scientific

Penick  SUBJECT: MARC INBOUND 800# COST REDUCTION IMPACT  MARC’s toll-free cost reduction will impact two of our operational areas: Smoker Recruitment and Product Research. Savings in the 1991 Product Research projects would have totaled $180,000 with MARC’s new toll-free cost. This represents an 8% reduction in their total fieldwork costs. For the smoker recruitment area, the savings are negligible as MARC’s new rate is slightly lower than what we were paying in 1991; and the use of the toll-free operation  has been increased significantly with changes in our recruitment document design.  Coincidentally, but unrelated to MARC’s inbound cost reduction, Tracker is  reducing the cost we were paying for the diary panel recruitment tag-on. This cost reduction will provide a $235m cost avoidance in 1992 and is explained below.  . $46m was spent with TRACKER in ‘91 for diary panel recruitment. On a cost/complete basis, this cost was more than what we paid  MARC for smoker recruiting through SRMS. When questioned about this discrepancy, MARC attributed this cost difference to the  different markups each group in MARC used. MARC has standardized this markup, and the price was reduced to $23m.  . Instead of reducing the cost of Tracker by $23m, we asked TRACKER to use this money to recruit as many smokers as possible due to the low cost/complete with the new price. This has resulted in doubling the number of smokers recruited.  . We also made a procedural change in how these smokers are used. Instead of putting these smokers directly into the diary panel, the smokers will now be placed in the SRMS and allocated where they can provide the greatest benefit. For example, an 18-24 year old Marlboro smoker to a CAMEL product test. This will allow us  to maximize savings for the company ($235m estimated in 1992) through the most efficient allocation of resources.  If you have any further questions, please call.  “traO  W. R.

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-1, Whitaker Park. RIRT may proceed with the installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modification.  For this modification, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct application of natural menthol at a maker will not significantly affect the current emission factor used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including menthol application to other brands, we would request certification of VOC emissions by use of appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certification would then be used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol  (FAS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated product.  537 North Spruce Street - Winston-Salem, NC 27101-1362 - Phone 910-727-8060 - Fax 910-727-2777  & Recycled Paper     Lye6 99¢2eS __label__Letter
IR ult. islbbaceo Company,  VINS’TON-SALEM,N.G.     January 14, 1954  Dear Fellow Employee: In order that you might have a better understanding of the many  operations carried on within the Company, we have outlined in previous —  letters the work performed by seven different Departments. Today we  want to tell you about another important teammate, the Advertising  Department. This Department is under the management of Mr. W. T. Smither, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. His Assistant is  Mr. Ernest M. Fulp. The 20 employees in the Department are directly  supervised by Mr. W. H. Maddrey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N.  Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager.  The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general  lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every  phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and  making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget  authorized. Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping  instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the  Company’s Sales Representatives in the field. National advertising of the Company’s products is one of the most  important phases of its business. It is true that superior quality is in  itself the best advertisement for any product.

DATE: September 25, 1975 MEDIA: — i CLIENT; VANTAGE | SIZE:  JOB NO.: Al101-532 ISSUE:     THE SWITCHER'S GUIDE TO LOW 'TAR' AND NICOTINE CIGARETTES.  With all the controversy about smoking going on, lots of smokers would like nothing better than to switch to low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes, After all, when you like smoking too much to quit, switching to a low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette is a realistic alternative.  But which low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette should a switcher switch to? ,  Well, for every smoker who has ever considered switching, here's an easy guide to low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes.  First, there are super low, low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes. They're fine if low numbers are all you want. Because their scientific filters work so well, they just about filter out all the taste.  Next. The low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes that claim to deliver flavor, If you've ever tasted one of them, you've probably been disappointed. Empty promises and empty taste, That's what these cigarettes are made of,  Finally, there's Vantage. The low 'tar’ and nicotine cigarette that's different from all the others.  Vantage isn't a watered down version of a cigarette. Because from the very beginning, Vantage was specially engineered to deliver flavor like a full-flavor cigarette, Without anywhere near the 'tar' and nicotine.  So if you'd like to switch to a low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette, try Vantage first. You might save yourself a lot of searching. Because Vantage will probably turn out to be the only low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette you'll enjoy smoking. __label__Advertisement

All samples were conditioned for 48 hours in the Smoking Lab conditioning room and weight selected by the Smoking Lab prior to analysis.  Four cigarettes from each group were then selected and analyzed using a Borgwaldt smoking machine coupled directly to a Varian 3600 GC. A Cambridge pad on the smoking machine removes the particulate matter from the whole smoke passing only the gas phase to the gas chromatograph. Puffs prior to the sample puff are vented. The sample puff selected is taken on the next puff after the burn line had passed a point 35mm from the tipping paper.  { 1 :  The gas phase column effluent is split into two detectors. The NPD detector is most selective to organic compounds containing nitrogen and the total area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds detected in the gas phase. The other detector is a FID which detects most organic compounds and the total FID  area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds. Experimental conditions are presented in Table I.

JUL 14 185  AMA Proposal Includes Regulating Tobacco as “Drug Delivery Vehicle’  TOBACCO, From Al ~  and that the industry deliberately con- cealed its knowledge from the public and the courts,  “No right-thinking individual can ig- nore the evidence” of tobacco industry duplicity, the JAMA editorial conclud- ed, “We should all be outraged, and we should force the removal of: this seourge from our nation and by so do- ing set an example for the world.”  The articles, taking up much of ‘next week's issue of JAMA, are based on an exhaustive analysis of internal tobacco industry documents conducted by a team headed by Stanton A. Glantz of the University of California at San Francisco, a prominent ant-smoking activist, The Brown & Williamson To- bacco Company documents have been the subject of newspaper articles and congressional hearings over the past year. The five articles provide the scientific review of the materials. vis though the major findings have been widely reported, Glantz said this schol- arly approach could serve as a guide for regulators, lawmakers, judges and others. “I see the big effect of these papers on the policymaking process,” Glantz said.  The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company issued 2 statement calling the JAMA articles “little more than a cherry-picking exercise” that selec- tively quoted statements from thou- sands of pages of documents stolen from the company.  Administration officials said yester- day that White House and FDA offi- cials have been discussing options aimed at stopping the sale or promo- tion of tobacco products to minors. They said the discussions had reached “senior political levels” within the     White House but that the president had not been directly involved, and that no plan had been presented to  Reports that the administration  could be nearing a decision on whether :  to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco sparked a furor among lawmakers.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R- Ga.) said the FDA had “lost its mind” for “picking a brand new fight when we haven’t won the far more serious fights about crack and cocaine and her- cin.” Other lawmakers called for the resignation of FDA Commissioner Da- vid A. Kessler.  But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D- Calif.) said that the opposition to regu- lation was coordinated by the political- ly powerful tobacco industry. “When the industry tells them to jump, the only question is, how high?” he said.  Clinton said yesterday in a Rose Garden appearance that he was most concerned with “the impact of ciga- rette smoking, particularly on our young people.”  In a statement yesterday, Kessler said, “The focus of our attention is to find ways to discourage children from starting [to smoke] in the first place. The administration is discussing what options to pursue, and as normally happens, any significant proposed reg- wation involves discussions with de- partment and White House officials.”  Administration sources said yester- day that in recent weeks, policymak- ers have been discussing five or six regulatory “option papers,” focusing on blocking tobacco marketing and sales to minors,  Regulatory actions under discussion between officials in the department of Health and Human Services, the White  House and the agency include prohibit- ing sales via vending machines: and other unrestricted distribution meth- ods such as handing out free’ samples at sporting events. Other proposals in- clude restricting advertising designed to appeal to children or teenagers.  But a broader, more comprehensive regulatory scheme being discussed over the past year is apparently not now under consideration. That contro- yersial proposal would have mandated the slow reduction of nicotine levels in tobacco products over a period of 10 or more years, eventually rendering them non-addictive. Such a program— if it could have been implemented and  if a threshold for addictiveness could:  be established—could have allowed youngsters to engage in experimenta- tion without becoming hooked, its ad- yocates claimed. But the plan never  * made it to the White House, sources  within the administration said.  Neither Kessler nor the .AMA is recommending a total ban on the sale of tobacco products, James S. Todd, executive vice president of the Ameri- can Medical Association, said in an in- terview yesterday, “Prohibition really doesn’t work. What we want to con- centrate on is education” and prevent- ing young people from taking up the tobacco habit.  Brennan Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, said yesterday that her organization believes that the FDA does not have the authority to regulate its products, but added, “If what the administration is talking about is reducing youth smoking, that’s certainly a goal shared by the to- baceb industry.”  Staff writer Ann Devroy contributed to this report. :  CHCTLLDPOS __label__News

TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  July 7, 1999  TO: All Salaried Employees in Corporate, Research and Product Development and Field Sales  FROM: Ronald S$. Milstein, Vice President, General Couns RE: Retention of Records for Antitrust Lawsuit (Lorillard v.  Philip Morris)     Lorillard recently sued Philip Morris, Incorporated ("Philip Morris") in federal court in Greensboro, charging that Philip Morris is attempting to unlawfully monopolize the retail cigarette  market through its "Retail Leaders" merchandising program. horillard's lawsuit has been consolidated with similar suits brought  by R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. Our lawsuit charges that Philip Morris' Retail Leaders program violates federal and state antitrust laws because it requires retailers to commit to exclusionary levels of display of Philip Morris brands, preventing Lorillard and other competitors from effectively displaying and advertising their brands. The judge in the case has issued a preliminary injunction that prevents Philip Morris from enforcing the more restrictive provisions of the Retail Leaders program. We expect that our suit will proceed to trial next spring.  As part of the pretrial proceedings, Philip Morris has served borillard with a request for documents, and we require your immediate assistance in helping the Company respond to this request. Please review this memo carefully, determine if you have any documents relating to the subjects set forth below, and segregate and retain all guch documents until further notice. You should then notify your supervisor and/or Jack Reilly, Associate General Counsel, Litigation (extension 7703) about the existence of such documents with an estimation of their volume (preferably by file drawer or box). Under no circumstances should you discard any document that relates to these  subjects.  ¥6P9ITIB __label__Memo

MICRO MARKETING PLAN  Background sf log In today’s environment, traditional mass marketing approaches with nationally oriented programs are becoming less and less effective. This could be explained in part by the fact that today’s smokers are far more fragmented in terms of lifestyle and product wants. Smokers have become > increasingly sophisticated and discriminating in their product choices. In addition, the retail environment is increasingly fragmented both in terms of types/number of outlets and the goods/services they provide their shoppers.  The result has been an explosion in the number of brands ; offered to smaller and smaller targets creating tremendous  clutter within traditional mass vehicles. Another result is _  wasted resources. As traditional mass spending approaches. are used, significant marketing resources are wasted against non-prospects in order to reach target smokers with a substantial level of impact. _  The traditional mass marketing approach may become even less important to the Company in the future for several reasons. The potential for advertising restrictions has increased. Restrictions may vary in form and severity by geography. This indicates the importance of local advertising/media __ flexibility. Retail marketing restrictions are less likely, therefore making the point-of-purchase an even more important advertising and promotional opportunity in the future. - RJRT has merchandising and overall presence strength to be leveraged in the retail environment. PM’s efforts to compromise this position is récognition of the value placed on the Micro retail marketing potential. The power of retail chains is growing, especially at the local level. This suggests the opportunity to adapt/tailor retail programs to exploit local retail opportunities.  A Micro Marketing approach to our business will provide RJRT the opportunity to tailor national brand strategies to specific smoker sub-segments based on lifestyle interests, geography, and retail opportunities. oe  Retail outlets will be classified on a consumer-driven basis. Segmentation will occur as outlets are classified on individual store purchase patterns.  Along with retail segmentation, smokers will be identified and segmented into homogeneous groups with something important in common such as ethnicity, key lifestyle interests, or geographical location.

\4 | wie  BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO  Marketing Research ~ Summary Report Lucky Strike Expansion Test Market Monitor - Wave 2  BACKGROUND / OBJECTIVES  In February 1998, Lucky Strike expanded its test market into three additional markets, Chicago, New York and Miami (referred to as the expansion markets). This expansion was in addition to San Francisco, Los Angeles/ San  Diego, and Sacramento (the Original markets).  The target segment for the Lucky Strike Filters was defined as free-thinking, independent-minded Male 21-30 Full Revenue, non-menthol, non-ultra, and non-slims smokers who smoke primarily Marlboro and Camel.  Marketing Objectives  The marketing objectives are to create awareness, generate trial and conversion, and enhance Lucky Strike imagery. The Marketing mix elements included:  « Advertising in ‘trendy’ magazines, alternative newspapers, and OOH « In-Store Promotional programs like lighters, pre-pack shippers, mystery shopper, telemarketing B1G1F and  metal tins. + Direct Mail: Two direct mail offerings were made in 1998. The ‘Rooftop’ offer in April was exclusive to the  expansion markets while the ‘multi-sensory’ offer of August covered all the test markets. « HORECA Bar promotions  Research Objectives  The primary focus of this study is to measure the impact of the Lucky Strike Advertising and Promotional programs on Awareness, Image and Usage of Lucky Strike Filters/Lights among the target group and among a representative sample of total smokers. Specific Research Objectives are to measure:  1. Awareness: « Unaided Trademark, Advertising, Direct mail, and Promotion Awareness for Lucky Strike trademark  » Aided Brand and Advertising Awareness for Lucky Strike Filters, Lucky Strike Lights and Lucky Strike trademark » Source of Advertising Awareness  2. Product and User Image of Lucky Strike Filters and Lucky Strike Lights 3. Usage: MOB, ORB, Total Purchase, Free Trials, and Aided Trials Method  The study was conducted in two-waves — April and October 1998. Telephone interviews were conducted in both the original and expansion markets among two groups of smokers:  * arepresentative sample of total smokers who were recruited via random dialing of households; and * atargeted sample of Male 21-30 year old Full Revenue, non-menthol, non-ultra, and non-slims smokers.

—— ~ - .-  _ BRANDS BUSINESS UNIT PRODUCT APPROVAL NOTE  BBU Note No. 15-94 — Date: 6/10/94  Temporary ____ Effective Date 6/27/94 Termination Date ©  Permanent _X  Type: Product _X Process _X Packaging ____ Flavor Tobacco ____ Material Other  SUBJECT: FULL PRICE ULTRA LIGHT NON-MENTHOL FILTER FLAVOR ELIMINATION and PLASTICIZER OPTIMIZATION (Except for NOW  Products)  BACKGROUND: Currently, nine different filter flavors are used in our Premium Domestic products. Of these, three are used in the full price non-menthol Ultra Light styles.  Testing to date indicates that there is no significant taste difference in products containing current levels of filter flavor, no filter flavor or ten times the current level.  Plasticizer level optimization is a program designed to simplify operations by reducing the number of plasticizer gears used by Manufacturing and to reduce cost. There is no adverse effect on finished product.  RECOMMENDATION: Remove filter flavors from all full price non-menthol Ultra Light styles with the exception of NOW (NOW will be considered under separate  evaluation). With the same filter specification change, optimize the plasticizer tevel -  in the filter.  RISK ASSESSMENT: All of the Ultra Light styles under consideration use the same blend. Products have been tested by the expert panel and are not significantly different when containing either E235, E240, E249, or no flavor. Additionally, this material change provides greater flexibility and reduced waste in Manufacturing.  Plasticizer optimization has no adverse effect on the filter and will allow gearing consolidation on the filter makers.  COST IMPLICATIONS: For the entire group of products, the cost savings for filter flavor elimination and plasticizer optimization is $72,000 annualized.  SbIT BPZTS __label__Report

Should the identity of the plasticizer be unknown, initial testing must include a  imple qualitative analysis by GC. Sample preparation consists of-extraction of Then the reaction of the extracted  nlasticizer from the filter material with methanol. Acetate with hydroxylamine, followed by an addition of ferric chloride, yields a The absorption maximum of the  4ferric hydroxamate complex, producing a violet color. 1 omplex is at 500 nm and follows Beer's Law from 0-800 ug/ml. The optical density range  is 0.00-0.700.  The simplicity of this procedure lends itself well to use with automated instrumenta- jon. It has*been adapted for use on the Robot Chemist which permits the performance of -Bnalyses at a rate of 120 per hour, less the standards necessary for a concentration k equally well for either triacetin or: triethylene:  urve.

BROW™ & WILLIAXISON TOBACCO CORPORATION  L600 West Hill Street + Louisvilie. Kentucky 40201  March 31, 1971  Dr. John H. Kreisher  The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A, 110 East Fifty-Ninth Street  New York, New York 10022  Dear John:  I would Like to indicate for you some of my thoughts on the current Walton-Morrissey Smoking Machine, demonstrated at the March 9 meeting.  It is obvious that considerable thought and effort has gone into bringing the machine to its present state of development. From a mechanical viewpoint the design is simple, straightforward, and should require minimum maintenance. There are several design features I would like to comment on, some of which were discussed at the meeting.  The design of the inhalation chamber is such that smoke distribution within the chamber is a function of the smoke entrance velocity and the dilution air stream. Since the entrance velocity is constant, as the dilution air is decreased, the effective distribution must, there- fore, decrease. After the two second puff is terminated, the smoke begins to age for an interval equal to the exposure time. Due to the chamber design it also begins to settle to the bottom of the chamber where the concentration is increased. Dr. Rosenkrantz commented that animals in the lower area always expire first. Only a long term study would establish a definite pattern.  During the meeting, attention was brought to the close proximity of the cigarettes to each other. Dr. Rosenkrantz was to determine if the free burn rate is changed due to radiant heat. The current holder design is based upon the use of 45 mm diameter Cambridge pads which restricts the spacing of the cigarettes. As I pointed out to you at the time, 70 mm dia. Cambridge pads are available which would permit the cigarettes to be moved further apart.  A final point in question is the capillary entrance port. This design creates a potential for two physical changes to occur to the smoke  aerosol. As the smoke is compressed into the smail diameter tunnel, the chance for collision between particles is increased. If the  CTR CONTRACTS 009745  11229487 __label__Letter
July 25, 1995  To: G. C. Pennell ec: Jim Helm Doug Shouse  From: Michael Corcoran Michelle Soyars Kathryn Noxon  Subject: Project Symphony Meeting  As we are postponing our Symphony meeting tomorrow, I wanted you to be aware of a couple of issues that, in order to keep the ball rolling, we may want to address prior to next Monday. Here is one item we wanted to discuss:  e Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan.  I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with Hogshead. H.J. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday.  As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. J. were going to propose that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings display, alongside Doral. They would not benefit from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success.  According to R.P., I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as another footprint.  At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and switch it out with existing RJR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a month instead of Doral, and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc.  e That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do, i.e. full partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock more conventional approach.  We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart. I just wanted you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation.  uw e ib H aa a N © Ww __label__Letter
J     ARTICLES  Xenograft Model of Progressive Human  Proliferative Breast Disease  Fred R. Miller, Herbert D. Soule, Larry Tait, Robert J. Pauley, Sandra R. Wolman, Peter J. Dawson, Gloria H. Heppner*     Background: Progression of proliferative breast disease has been associated with increased risk for development of invasive carcinoma. Cell lines have been developed to facilitate the study of this process. Human cell] line MCFIO0A originated from spontaneous immortalization of breast epithelial cells obtained from a patient with fibrocystic disease, and cell lines MCF10AneoN and MCF10AneoT were created by stable transfection of these cells with the neomycin-resistance gene and either the HRAS gene or the mutated T-24 HRAS gene, re- spectively. Purpose: Our goal was to develop an experimental model of progressive human proliferative breast disease. Methods: MCF10A, MCF10AneoN, and MCF10AneoT cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of male nude/beige (C57/BALB/c nu/nu bg/ bg) mice (12 mice for each cell type). These mice were examined periodically for formation and persistence or growth of palpable nodules. One mouse per group was killed 1 week after cell injection; thereafter, mice were observed as long as possible. Cells were recovered from palpable lesions by enzymatic dissociation of the excised lesions. Cells re-established in tissue culture from a week-14 tumor (MCF10AneoT.TG1) were injected into 12 male nude/beige mice. Southern blot hybridization analysis of the HRAS gene locus and cytogenetic analyses were performed. Results: Transplanted MCF10A and MCF10AneoN cells formed transient, small palpable nodules that regressed and disappeared during the 4th and 5th weeks. In 10 of the 12 mice, T-24 HRAS gene- transfected MCF10A cells (MCF10AneoT) formed small, flat nodules that persisted for at least 1 year. Three of these xenografts became carcinomas. One (removed 7 weeks after transplantation) was an undifferentiated carcinoma composed of polygonal cells with large, vesicular nuclei and numerous mitoses. The second (removed after 14 weeks) was an invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The third (removed after 56 weeks) was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Initially, xenografts of MCFLOAneoT.TG1 cells showed intraductal proliferative changes; after 23 weeks, the lesions showed  Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 85, No. 21, November 3, 1993  histologic features resembling those seen in atypical hyperplasia of the human breast, and later lesions showed characteristics of carcinoma in situ. The MCF10 lineage of cells of three MCF10AneoT.TG1 xenografts was confirmed by DNA fingerprinting and karyotype anal- ysis. Conclusions: MCF10AneoT and MCF10AneoT.TG1 comprise a transplantable xenograft medel that produces a broad spectrum of human proliferative breast disease. Implications: The reproducible establishment of repre- sentative stages in early breast cancer progression from the MCF10 model offers a new opportunity to analyze critical events of carcinogenesis and progression in breast cancer. [J Natl Cancer Inst 85:1725-1732, 1993]     Many human carcinomas evolve via a sequence from benign hyperplasia through atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ and eventually to fully malignant, invasive tumors with the potential to metastasize. In the case of colorectal neoplasia, the well-recognized polyp-to-carcinoma sequence is associated with a series of specific genetic alterations (7). Although the colon cancer model has become a paradigm for solid tumor development, definition of critical genetic events in breast cancer has been hampered by the lengthy natural history, architectural complexity, and relative inaccessibility for sampling of breast cancers, particularly at the small, early stages. In the human female breast, a spectrum of pathologic change has been termed proliferative breast disease. The progression of histopathologic features of proliferative breast disease has been associated with increased risk for the development of invasive carcinoma (2). Women with the most severe form of proliferative breast disease, atypical hyperplasia, have a fourfold to fivefold increased relative risk of developing breast cancer.  A series of human mammary epithelial cell lines has been derived at the Michigan Cancer Foundation from a woman with fibrocystic disease.

The CIB suggests that "exposure to ETS is most efficiently and completely controlled by simply eliminating tobacco use from the workplace." Short of a smoking ban, the CIB recommends separate ventilation for smoking areas.  Responses  ° No effort is made in the CIB to assess actual workplace exposures to ETS, Instead, tha report simply states that 29% of U.S. adults smoke, that urinary cotinine hag bean observad in nonsmokers and that respirable suspended particulate measures support the notion that nonsmokers are exposed in the  workplace.  -- of the eleven epidemiologic studies on ETS that examine workplace smoking exposure, only one reports a significant association <-= ten report no such statistically significant association.  “-- The authors of the one workplace study to report a statistically significant association suggested in their report that the association was weak and did not seem to fall in line with the other conclusions of the study.  - The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently argued, in response to an Action on Smoking and Health law suit seeking an emergency temporary standard banning workplace smoking, that the data on workplace exposure is scant, and is insufficient to support an emergency standard. OSHA's arguments were upheld by the vis: gourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  -~ Several scientific papers, including research undertaken by the American Health Foundation, have reported that workplace exposure to ETS is far lower than that found in the home, The CIB does not even mention this data, let alone discuss it, though the CIB concedes that "the relative contributions of work versus home environments in ETS exposure has not been well quantified."  oO  Ss  ~ ~l J oO oo ee re __label__Report

Dear Dr. Stone,  The Radiation Research Society is holding its thirty-seventh annual meeting in Seattle, on March 18-23, 1988. The Society is by far the biggest of its type in the world, and typically has more than 1000 participants at the annual meeting. One of the sessions, which I have been asked to organise, is a Workshop on “The Interaction Between Radon Exposure and Smoking." A brief description of the workshop, and the participants, is enclosed, the former to be included in the conference program book. In light of our phone conversation, it would be most helpful and extremely appropriate if the Council for Tobacco Research could sponsor the seminar, in terms of a contribution of, say, $2500, towards the travel expenses of the participants. An appropriate acknowledgement vould, of course, appear in the conference program.  Closer to home, our own laboratory has been doing a considerable amount of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions - which would imply that the hazard of radon + smoking is larger than the sum of the hazards from radon alone and smoking alone. Our end point will be in-vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a seminar - or a more informal discussion - on tobacco research in general? Our laboratory has a seminar series, and a small honorarium is usual.  I enclose our laboratory annual report, and my own ©.V., to give you a feel for the scope of our activities.

Pentagon Steps Up Effort to Limi     Promotion, Sale of Tobacco in Miltary     By Bradley Graham  ‘Washington Post Staff Writer  Stepping up efforts to curb cigarette smoking among military personnel, the Pentagon intends to ban such premo tional practices as military-only discount coupons and tobacco company pay- ments ts stores for favorable product placement, and will limit the amount of shelf space reserved for tobacco prod- ucts in military outlets.  The Defense Department's antismoking drive reflects heightened concern, Pentagon officials say, about the drain on tighter military budgets of lost productivity and rising health care costs associated with smoking, But the Pentagon's inifiative has generated sparks over the past year with a House defense subcommittee, many of whose members have received campaign dona- tions from the tobacco industry.  A decision last suramer to raise the price of cigarettes sold in military com- missaries led to heated congressional charges that the Pentagon had failed to consult sufficiently with legislators and was Violating federal pricing rules that  required commissaries to sell products at it “the lowest practical price.” One tobacco-state lawmaker, Rep. C. Saxby Chambliss (R4Ga.), warned the Penta- gon earlier this year not to impose the restrictions on cigarette advertising and marketing that defense officials have now formally notified Congress they plan to put into effect this summer.  Although the latest measures afe not expected to draw enough congressional opposition to block them, the smoking issue generally has placed the Pentagon in the trying position of balancing con- cems about the health and fitness of service members against the rights of members to choose whether to smoke.  For years, military life facilitated smoking. Mess kits contained free ciga- rette packs, Tobacco firms would send cigarettes to combat zones as a patriotic gesture, a practice stopped during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Training drills allowed for periodic smoke breaks, Car- tons could be purchased in military commissaries for discounts of up to 76 percent off commercial retail prices.  “A lot of people picked up smoking in the military.” said John Mazzuchi, a Pentagon health official who has had a role in the antismoking effort's slow evolution. “We had to create a new  educational environment, a new culture in which the command was saying smoking is not cool, it's not good for you and it’s bad for overall readiness of the force.”  Defense Department attempts to cur- tail smoking began in the mid-1980s, although the campaign was limited then to educating service members about the health risks of using tobacco products. By the early 1990s, a government-wide effort to ban smoking in federal areas led to a smoke-free Pentagon and desig- nated smoking areas on military bases,  But raising commissary prices was a  much more sensitive proposition, be- cause the discounts available in these government-subsidized military super- markets are highly valued by service members. Defense officials were reluc- tant to single out any product as an exception. Besides, tobacco products were big business for commissaries, generating $747 million in revenue and $103 million in profits and surcharge revenue in 1995.  ‘What finally prompted the Pentagon to act were the rising costs of smoking- related productivity losses and medical care, estimated at $930 million in 1995.  “We were actually asking the Ameri- can taxpayer to subsidize a product that we knew was injurious to health, in which there were substantial costs,” said Fred Pang, the Pentagon’s assistant secretary for force management.  Cigarettes are still sold in the mili- tary’s 230 commissaries, but responsi bility for managing the sales now rests with the military exchanges, which are not subsidized and so charge more. Even so, tobacco prices in these military outlets remain below commercial retail levels—a fact that defense officials ap- pear resigned to accept rather than court more political attack.  “We considered raising prices to pre vailing market rates, and we concluded that at least for now, the pricing policy we have is defensible.” said Pang. “We have not rejected absolutely that we would not do something like raise prices farther. That is under review now.”  Areport by the Pentagon's inspector general. issued in December, urged that prices be lifted to commercial retail levels. “The Department of Defense is sending a mixed messag é to its benedi- cjary population,” it said. “DOD should not encourage tobacco sales through discounted prices when the DOD health  community {fs striving to reduce the effects of tobacco on the active-duty force and its beneficiary population.”  In a move that defense officials see as retaliation for the earlier price hike. a House National Security subcommittee inserted language in this year's defense authorization bill shifting responsibility for overseeing the military stores from Pang's force management office to the comptroller.  Rep. John M. McHugh (N.Y), chairman of the House National Securi- ty Committee’s panel on morale, welfare and recreation (MWR), said in an inter- view that the measure had nothing to do with getting even. “It simply was an attempt to respond better to MWR programs, whose major crises are all financially related." the congressman stressed.  But the Pentagon is convinced re- venge played a part in the panel's attempt to eliminate the job held by Stephen Rossetti Jr., a former Demo- cratic staff member on the House sub- committee who was hired by Pang to revamp the military stores and imple ment the new cigarette policy.  “The panel's action clearly was at least somewhat retaliatory,” said Pang. “The comptroller could certainly do the job, but the military stores are regarded by service members as a benefit. a very valued benefit, and all the benefit pro- grams fall under this office. The pro- posed change would be an added re sponsibility for the comptroller that doesn't make any sense.”  Ina letter to McHugh last week, Pang  enclosed a draft copy of the new order” limiting promotional displays and shelf. space for tobacco products in military. stores. Additional measures banning cigarette sales to anyone under age 18, free samples and vending machine oper: ations were being taken to conform to Food and Drug Administration rules, Pang wrote, .  The Pentagon's declining tolerance for smoking has resulted in a drop in the proportion of smokers in uniform, from 52 percent in 1985 to 32 percent, slightly 6 above the civilian proportion. By 2000, defense officials intend to cut the num- ber of active-duty personnel who smoke to 20 percent,  “We going to continue to push it, but we have to look for our opportunities,” said Mazzuchi. “Having been here 24 CN years, | know you don't win every battle. ~" Weil take our victories where we can get them,” __label__News

MaJor histocompatibility complex class IJ molecules and their peptide ligands show unusual interaction kinetics, with slow associ- ation and dissociation rates that yield an apparent equilibrium constant of ~10 *-107° M (refs 1-5). However, there is evidence for a specific, rapidly formed, short-lived complex’. The altered migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of class II molecules upon stable peptide binding’ has led to the hypothesis that the two kinetically distinguishable types of class Il-peptide complexes correspond to different structures. In accord with this model, we demonstrate here that insect cell-derived HLA-DR1     a  E 10  a  £  &  8 ORISHA —»  = “HA trail { 10?  9 50 100 150 200  Disgociation time (min)  FiG, 1 Empty MHC class Hl molecules show both fast-on/fast-off and slaw-on/slow-off interactions with a single peptide species. a, Peptide— DR1 complexes were formed by incubation of 0.3 pM sDR1 with 100 pM +251 labelled HA peptide (HA) for 10 min or 48 h at 37 °C.

Fractions containing the labelled peptide were pooled and stored at 4°C. HPLC analysis showed that the +251 label coincided with the peptide peak. In most experiments the peptide poo! was vacuum-concentrated to 2.5-3 mM (6-7 x 10°c.p.m. per pl). Pep- tide concentration was determined by tyrosine absorption or quantita- tive amino-acid analysis. Reaction mixtures contained sDR1 at 0.3 pM and, unless otherwise indicated, peptide at 100 2M in PBS in a total volume of 50 wl. Spun cofumns (BioRad; 0.7 ml, containing BioGel P2) were blocked using 20% non-fat dry milk in PBS plus 0.02% NaN, and used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. There was a linear correlation between the number of fast-farming comptexes and the concentration of sDR1 used for incubation {S.S.N., unpublished observations}, which indicates that labelled HA 306-318 binds to sDR1 and not to blocking proteins or other components of the assay system. For measurement of dissociation rates, peptide and sDR1 were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and passed through a spun column at room temperature. The excluded volume was collected, counted, and incubated for the first indicated dissociation time. It was then reapplied to a spun column and the excluded volume recovered and counted. This process was repeated to generate the data for the entire set of dissociation times. Native gel electrophoresis was per- formed using Mini-PROTEAN II Ready Gels from BioRad as described’. Dried gels were autoradiographed.  50701941 __label__Scientific

We have labeled this as request number B1060. It was produced from the MCP SAS History week ending 9/26/98.  There were some changes made to the request.  * We changed the completeness store count to include active and completeness checks for 65 out of 65 weeks. This is just a store count and does not have an impact on the volume reported.  * We were unable to provide the Retail Masters Y/N column. This was excluded fram the report.  * The total store counts for 1997 and 1998 are calculated based on the current definition of the stores within a chain. This means that the  stores associated with the chain in the current time period will be the same stores checked on the 1997 history. We do not keep old assignments of  retail ids to a particular chain. Therefore there would not be a difference between the counts. We created one column with the total STARS stores and another based on the Retail Masters stores.  * The CPW values are based on the average per chain within a week. We pulled the data from LINQ and collapsed it by chain. Then that value was divided by the total number of retail ids within the chain.  If you have any questions, just let me know.

To:  From:  PHILIP MORRIS. U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  RICHMOND, WIRGINIA  -Mr. K. S. Burns bate: September 22, 1975  *G. D. Keritsis  Subject: -Desiyned Filler - 1504, Third Quarter, 1975  I. LOW TAR FILLER (LTF) A. Chemical Evaluation  1. The LTF-ILIDF formulation whose whole smoke conden- sate compared favorably to that of LIA has been modified further at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of  these modifications was that of IIJF which is a similar material to IIDF but without humectant.  The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared to that of IIDF; and based on the correlation of Grimmer fractions II, III and IV with activity, the order of relative predicted activity is LTF-IIJF > LTF-IIDF. The absolute activity, however, is predicted to be low for both types since the yield of fraction II is greater than 90%. in both cases.  2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.  B. Smoking Evaluations  Ll. A range of low tar fillers (LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIJF and IIICF) possessiny similar subjective characteristics, varying tar deliveries, and significantly lower CO values (7-9 myg/cigt) were developed and screened.  2. The blend and flavor development studies were continued with 50 and 75% LTF-1IDF in the blend,  3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts of the low molecular weight organic acids (C,-C,») with LTF-IIDF formilation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke at tlie 50 and 75% levels.  4. The tole of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliverics is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed LYF-I1D and I11B.  2000766495  C75-83529 __label__Memo
January 10, 1995  SUMMARY  MEASURES OF PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO FDA REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS  Public Opinion Poll .  The majority of Americans favor the current level of regulation of cigarettes or even teducing it --- only a minority believe regulations should be expanded to include the FDA.  Opinions do not differ by gender, age, education or income level and no subgroup favors expanded regulation.  Petitions  More than one million adult Americans have signed petitions opposing FDA regulation of tobacco products.  Signatures from every state -and every Congrerssional district-- illustrate widespread opposition to the FDA regulation.  Letters  Thousands of Americans from all walks of life have written to FDA in recent months  opposing FDA regulation tobacco products,  A sampling of these letters show broad, nationwide opposition to the FDA proposal and a strongly held view that FDA action is unnecessary.  a = m oa eS o a n wo  tie einer nvennananninttiaetmes __label__Report

After only: three days, your nervous system is “fooled” into be- Heving you are smoking your favorite. cigaret, cigar or pipe.  This sort of promotion has been mushrooming all over the U. S. since the Surgeon. General's re- port on smoking and cancer was released early in 1964. Since. January, Better Business Bureaus throughout the ‘country have been flooded with inquiries about dozens of “new” anti-smoking pills and lozenges, mouthwashes and chewing gums, stop-smoking plans and programs costing up to $40 and more for “the cure.”  Fanciful claims by manufacturers. for their products and programs include “miracle ingredi- ents” supposed to be “99 per cent effective’ and to “force you to quit whether you want to or not.” New commercial “tobacco guidance centers” with lofty-sounding names have sprung up from coast to coast—only a few of. them under competent medical supervision,  * * *  Millions of us are paying millions of dollars for products we hope will rid us painlessly of the cigaret habit.  We are gulping sugar pills and concoctions of ordinary spice such as ginger, Heorice, clove, cori- ander—as well as pharmaceutical preparations— to stamp out the cigaret craving.  We are. taking up fake cigarets—dubbed “smokes” or “adult pacifiers’ which contain such non-nicotinie ingredients as metho} srystals,     cabbage, lettuce or just flavored cigaret paper— to keep our nervous hands busy and permit us to “smoke without fear.”  We are falling for suggestive “stop smoking” phonograph records, recently the subject. of in- vestigation by the U.S. Post Office.  : We are enrolling in a wide variety of so-called “positive thinking” programs, even hypnosis, to spirit us away fromi tobacco. We are devouring no-smoke tablets. and how-to-stop-smoking pam-  phlets. % x *  Just what is the value of these pills and pro- motions? What can and can't they do? From the National Better Business Bureau’s Dr. Irving Ladimer, here are a few straight answers:  Despite the welter of new labels, there are no really “pew” substances on the market te help us stop smoking. Old ones simply have heen dressed up or combined to appear new,  The three standard types of anti-smoking medications now available are the nicotine sub- stitute (lobeline sulfate), which alleviates cigaret craving; substances which make smoking taste unpleasant (silver nitrate), and local anesthetics (benzocaine) which numb the mouth and reduce desire for.the puffing part of the smoking ritual.  Many- of these products do, in fact, help you .  quit smoking temporarily. But none does the job permanently. None works without a generous dose of will power on your part. Most are harm less, but a few cases of nausea, stomach -pain and loss of appetitite have been reported as. side- effects.  In conclusion, the American Medical Assn. |  states: “It is possible that some individuals amen: able to psychological suggestion would find anti- tobacco preparations to be an ald. However, ex- cessive smoking is a psychiatric problem and must be treated as such if the individual is unable to rid Eimself of the nabit voluntarily.”  Tomorrow: Health Quackery.  2  Evpszoszo __label__News

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Souza Cruz will win in a second instance, considering that “manufacturing cigarettes is a legal activity... Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes manufacturing activity even more legitime.” One of the lawyers who has been consulted (Dr. Celso Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US influence”.  An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidénio) questioned “how it could be possible to determine if the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”, and still complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also  provoque heart attacks”.  Only one attorney believes that “sf it could be proven that the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cuz and that his death was really a consequence of the smoking habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a fact”. This same attorney considered, at the other hand, shese proves difficult to be obtained.  Licio Pedro Macsanyi Corporate Affairs Manager  ECEIWE SEP 2.5 097 ROGER G.

oriliud  MEMORANDUM  July 7, 1994  TO: W. C. Baylies From: E. F. DeLaura  RE: Topline: Current Harley Lights Box 80’s Vs.  Proto Harley Lights Box 80’s In-Home Product Test MPID #5545/294 eyo  This presents the topline results for the In-Home product test conducted for the prototype Harley Lights Box 80’s versus the current Harley Lights Box 80’s.  Background  When producing the Harley Light Box 80’s product, R&D was confronted with significant manufacturing problems.  Specifically, the current box product was not found to be close enougc in taste characteristics to that of tne 85’s sott pack version. Additionally, the box product varied as R&D had trouble maintaining the product’s specifications.  Thus, R&D developed a revised Harley Lights Box product that employed a new filter which enabled the prototype to have taste characteristics that were closer to the king size Harley Lights.  Please note, since the time this study was initiated, R&D has resolved the manufacturing problem and is now producing a  consistent box 80’s product that successfully meets product specifications.  Objective  The Action Standard set for this study was a parity or better  performance for the prototype versus the current Harley Lights Box 80’s product among Marlboro Lights Box 80’s smokers.

INTER-OFFICE CORRE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592  To: Jim Kordenbrock DATE: May 17, 1994     FROM: Michelle Salzman / Rick Wilhelm SUBJECT: RX Management Materials -- Agency Development Brief.  The following outlines the information that is to be incorporated into the Management Materials for Project RX.  OVERVIEW  As the penny profit generated from sales of RX is less than those realized from the sale of full margin brands and, in some instances, deep discount brands, the focus of the “sell story" for RX will be one based on consumer demand for the product. In essence, consumer demand for RX will be so strong that retailers not carrying the product will be ata competitive disadvantage. To support this argument, key learnings from the RX Ad-pack research (such as purchase interest), as well as a few "memorable" consumer quotes from focus groups and onc-on-oncs, will be incorporated into the sales materials.  The actual sell in brochure should be a printed 4 page, 4 color piece that contains a pocket for introductory. allowance worksheets, pricing worksheets P.O.S. menu items etc.  4 R BROCHURE  The following details the clements which are to be included on the sales brochure in priority order:  1) RX Proposition  First and foremost, retailers must he educated as simply as possible as to what RX is all about. They musi clearly understand it's positioning as every bit a Marlboro that because its shorter costs less.  While retail pricing is obviously a critical element to the success of RX, the brand's desired absolute rctailpricing of RX should not be printed on the actual 4 color brochure. Instead, suggested retil pricing will be handled on a scparate worksheet insert so that Sales reps. can adjust pricing on un account by account basis (sec example)  2) Sell Story:  Involving and straight-forward copy that “sells” the retail trade on the strong consumer demand RX will generate and how important itis that he/she carry the product is the foundation of ths sites sheers and must be boldly communicated.  2024072051 __label__Memo

HARARE : ZIMBABWE  TELEPHONE 50411}  : TELEGRAMS: “TOBRES” Mr. Andre Beuchat,  Deltafina S.P.A., PLEASE ADDRESS ALL Via Donizetti 10, whe vintenom 00198 ROMA,  Italy.  Dear Andre,  I have now managed to sit down and organize the  two projects which we are to offer for PILC work  with the Smoke/Technology Groups. I thought you ‘would like to have details to be able to present  a more detailed programme at the meeting in Florence.  l. Nitrogen sources and nitrous oxide in smoke  We will have tobacco from three sources of nitrogen, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea. This is a properly replicated trial so we can give them up to ten replications.  2. Effect of sucker control compounds on leaf quality  We can supply up to four replications of cured leaf  treated with n-decanol, octonol decanol mixtures, Prime Plus (CGA41065) Bud Nip (chlorpropham),  Accotab (pendimethalin), Tamex (butralin), FST-7 (n-decanol plus potassium salt of maleic hydrazide) and several others.  From ooth these trials we will have yield and quality figures and this could be supplemented by any figures from Smoke group. Our tobacco will be available at the end of April 1984.  I hope this will be useful in presenting your case in Florence.  Yours sincerely,  ives ,  L.T.V. Cousins, SENIOR AGRONOMIST.  LTVC/rg  £SS9 €@nos __label__Letter
Tobacco tax could be  a deginning, not an end  hat does the nation want from W vse:  The crop is a moneymaker for the country. Since 1940, taxes on tobacco products have brought in more than 3129 billion dollars.  It supports small farms. The average tobacco farm covers less than 136 acres.

Tobacco 1s great except for one thing. it it kills the peopie wno use it And for thar  good reason. ieaf is Deing taxed out of existence.  F LEXINGTON HERALD-LEADER.  NOVEMBER 21, 1993  The structure. however — the smail ‘arms. tne cooperatives. the warehouses and work organizations — will remain. And if anyone has a shred of sense. the weo of farms and co-ops that have held together much of the rural southeast for the last 70 years will be put to other productive uses.  That can happen. At least, that’s what a group of farmers, oe economists and burley cooperative leaders thought when they first gathered last spring at a meeting” called by Berea’s Community Farm Alli- ance. Since then. the group has been knitting together pieces of the future.  The group has produced the outline of 2 plan. a 27-page document being quietly cwrcuiated around the South. Lrorucaily, the proposal depends on the Clinton heaith pian, the one that cails for a massive new ax on tobacco. Part or that money couid ‘shouid. farmers say) go back to topacco counties. Depending on which proposal ‘winds up in the Clinton packages, tobacco counties could receive more than 31 billion a year.  So this is the question: Given $1 billion a year. how can tobacco farmers and communities buiid new economies? How can tobacco counties survive as the de- mand for tobacco slackens’  The study does mot claim there is any singie crop that can repiace tobacco. Too much time has been wasted on this de- bate. There isn't any new muracie crop. The best the government can do is set up a system where innovative farmers and communities can find new ways Io use their assets to make money.  re  Under this plan. tax receipts wou: into a tobacco community trust fund. investment authonty, working with t: existing co-ops, would decide how to tribute the money.  The money would flow to tobaccc counties in severai wavs. A farmer or groups of farmers couid appiy for ioar. grants to deveiop a new agriculturai :: structure —- for exampie. conversion . existing tobacco warehouses to packir. cooling taciiities for other crops. (The report lists dozens of possible venture.  Other money wouid go for researc: for loan guarantees for agncuiturally - ‘ated projects ana for community pian ning. Or. farmers could ask the author to buy out their tobacco quotas. (Farm. taking buy-outs would be required to reinvest that money on the farm or in community.)  The pian 1s a good one because it builds on the structures that already e in tobacco country, the co-ops and farr {It also directs money specifically to su Sort farm counnes. And it encourages local ininatve. in the end, after all. if tobacco country “iii be saved, tobaccc farmers wiii have to do the saving.  Those are the ingredients ot good : ‘ong-lasung development. Now. it just needs to be passed by Congress.  89268210 __label__News

Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Dr. C. L. Ellis ) Date: August 25, 1998 From: A. I. Goldsmith YS  4 Subject: The Merit story  When Merit was launched in 1976, part of the promotional activities included a whirlwind tour by Dr. Ikeda touting the scientific breakthrough that enabled the creation of a low delivery cigarette with a full flavor taste; other researchers also spoke to the press, including Bill Dunn, Walt Gannon, and Hel- mut Wakeham. Based on the news reports —- some of which are enclosed — I pieced together a possi- ble sequence to account for a reference to nine years of research in light of the fact that the quest for a flavorful low tar cigarette goes back at least to 1958 [C58-00972; 1]. Actually, most news stories say  twelve years, which probably dates to the 1964 Surgeon General’s report. Interestingly, however, C75-01560 lists HTI test codes for high burley blends similar to the Timer blend so as to be able to substantiate claims that work had been continuing for seven years.  It would appear that Dr. Ikeda’s clock started ticking at about the time a research program began at the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) of which Philip Morris was a sponsor.  Philip Morris first got involved with TRI in 1965 [C65-03108], when looking into electrostatic filters. ! Then in 1968, along with Airkem, Armour & Company, Gillette, Givaudan, Glidden-Durkee, S. C. Johnson & Company, Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble, Rexall Chemicals, and Vick Chemical, Phi- lip Morris began jointly sponsoring a research program on odor characterization and measurement headed by Andrew Dravnieks. Progress reports from IITRI [2-12] refer to olfactometers, and of course gas chromatography was relied upon heavily, both of which correspond with the terminology in Ikeda’s presentations. When the initial three year program concluded, Philip Morris signed on as a co-sponsor of a two year follow-up program.  More significantly, Philip Morris assisted in a study on the determination of odor components in tobacco smoke, which was sponsored by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Con- ditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Phase I [9 and 13] found GC peaks correlating with likely contributors to tobacco odor, and Phase Il used mass spectrometry to identify most of the constituents [11]. Although the commercial cigarettes used were Winston, Philip Morris provided 1R1 Reference Cigarettes for use; some cigars and pipe tobaccos also were studied. In addition, PM R&D experts assisted in the identification of some ambiguous mass spectra. There was supposed to have been a Phase IIT geared to creating a tobacco odor simulant for room ventilation studies by mixing the most important constituents identified in Phase II, but I have not found a copy of a Phase III report.  The Phase II report is significant, because later in 1974 one sees the first indications in internal docu- mentation of the identification of odor-intense smoke constituents with the goal of using some to add flavor to a low delivery product [IR74-089 and C75-05631]. The major discontinuity in this sequence is that TRI’s compounds seem to relate more to room odor or even to stale odor than to the flavorful odor of fresh mainstream smoke. The urgency of Project Timer seems to have left little time for writ- ten documentation other than in laboratory notebooks, so it is difficult to determine how, when, and by  ' Probably because the Surgeon General's Report discussed the charge on smoke particles.  bSP8TS090Z __label__Memo

Mr. Johnston has received a letter, which was forwarded to me, and I subsequently received a phone call from.... a Sally Wilson. Sally is an employee of the New York Metropolitan Authority.  Where she works, they have separately ventilated smoking rooms. They have used them with success for several years now. Recently, however, management said they were still  getting complaints, and they could no longer smoke there at all. Have to step outside.  To be candid, up front, I have to tell you that Sally sounds to me like one of those "what have you done for me in the last five minutes?" types. Rather pushy, fairly humorless, cic.  But, it sounds like they are really, really getting the short cnd of the stick if, as she says, they truly have separately ventilated rooms and can't even use them anymore.  She wants our help. Ultimately, this one looks like it is an organizational/activist challenge. Maybe someone should go to New York and meet with her. See what they can do to help from an activist/organizational standpoint. Who do we have that works N. Y. C. these days? If we were able to help them out, it might be a nice success story for New York.

NICOTINE SPECIFIC MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY ee a th SUNUCLONAL ANTIBODY  A. Objective: To obtain a monoclonal antibody (MCA) against nicotine (NIC=-MCA):.  B.. Results: A thromboxane B2 scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was conducted. Results from this experiment: indicted that we can technically detect antibody-radioisotope binding under the SPA conditions. This indilcates that previous: negative results with SPA assays were not. due to technical difficulities associated with scintillation detection.  Cc.

—- io = i ‘ nan Sa we ve ae Le - VO). can ot SUBJECT: LNA Consumer Tests DATE: April 21, 1989 TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: J. P. Dickerson  I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-10P, scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The LNA-LOV product, which is being mailed for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining consumer test data on a "no-nicotine" protocept. The LNA-1OV product has a blend nicotine of 0.11% and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette. Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05-0.06% in Merit Free  and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to 0.06 in Merit Free and Next.  The low nicotine in LNA-10V was obtained through conventional denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-10P product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In  theory, the LNA-10P approach will give approximately the same nicotine value as the LNA-10V approach, using tobacco blends in inventory.  If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison  of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water extraction is being changed significantly.  Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that  would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to producing material for one consumer test.  I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we  should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-10P until we have done a more thorough job of process and formulation development.  9.0 Mca  . J. P.

He is only partly inclined to leave his present connection, but would be interested in tobacco research that utilized his knowledge of steroids, He might engage in such research at Northwestern, either sponsored  or gratis.  Dr. Chen feels in particular that the steroids in tobacco should be characterized, and an effort made to see whether they lead to carcinogenic  materials in tobacco smoke. Also, if any tobacco steroid qualifies as starting material for a medicinal such as cortisone, the resulting publicity  would be of great value to the tobacco iniustry.  If Dr. Chen does not qualify for an opening in our laboratory, it is suggested that he be referred to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee for  a possible research grant,  690 LO00S __label__Report
rawr.     MEMORANDUM TO: A. Pasheluk FROM: I. J. Staub RE: ' TRUE IMAGE STUDY -- Psychographic Analysis  This memo should serve to further explain the specifics of the psychographic lifestyle clustering we will be utilizing in the image study. It should be noted that this particular analysis is being used here on an experimental basis due to a limited working knowledge of its usefulness in this area (there is little historical data on this subject which can be used for comparison), and because of the relatively small sample size in this study. We are hopeful, though, that the incorporation of the lifestyle clusters can further enhance the analysis and provide additional direction for the agency's purposes.  As you know, the lifestyle clusters are derived from a series of sequential steps beginning with the self-administered list of statements which the respondent rates in terms of how well the statement describes him/her. The particular list we are using in this study is a general one with no smoker-related items and was supplied by an outside expert who has vast experience with psychographics. It is our feeling that this general list is sufficient for our purposes at this time.  The next step in the sequence is the utilization of a factor analysis which will group items that correlate together across the sample of respondents into five or six groupings which we will label as "Quality Consciousness", "Conservatism", "Sociability", etc. Then a cluster analysis is done which groups people that correlate together for their rating of the items or for demographic profiles (such as older/younger).  Assuming that the groupings we get are able to discriminate, the technique will provide us with an additional area of analysis of our potential market - their lifestyle characteristics ~ in addition to demographics.

Perfetti Flavor Division, PA&T  Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter Sheet Material  The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaC03. (Sample G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to 30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal- ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 + 2985 ug/cigarette, i.e. 4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 ug/ cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 1g/cigarette) and  silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066 ug silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.  The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaC03 present in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette.  As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G).  : tt, fy omas A.

THE THEATRE  :New Plays in Manhattan  ' The: Male Animal (by James Thurber & Elliott Nugent; produced by Herman Shumlin) provides Broadway—in a season tich only in comedy-—with another comedy hit. A frail, rachitic tyke of a play, with barely enough clothes to cover it, The Male Animal manages to captivate by its impish tongue and winning smile. It re- sembles a dinner party where there isn’t nearly enough food but where the conver- sation is so amusing that nobody minds.  . James Thurber, famous for iustrating The War Between the Sexes with his run-  James THurzer (SELF-PORTRAIT) Good conversation, not enough food,  away pencil, has curried the combat to the stage. The Male Animal tells of a young English professor (Elliott Nugent) .who has all the trouble that Thucher thinks the male animal is born to. The prof gets branded a Red for wanting to read one of Vanzetti’s letters to his class. He gets all tingled up with his wife when an old sweetheart of hers comes to town for a football game. A Milquefoast by nature, the professor’ quaiis too much of the cup that emboldens, and in 2 hilarious drunk scene decides to hold his mate as bull ele- phants, swans, land crabs do—by fighting for her. He does hold her, but not with his fists; it turns out that the old beau's interest is only pigskin deep.  The Male Animal serves up its bit of plot successively as roast turkey, creamed turkey, turkey hash, scraps, soup, and bones for the dog. Fortunately, Play- wright Thurber’s insane, melancholy stant on life fills the play with fresh and free- flowing laughter. Frustration is leavened jnto nonsense, indignation is alkalized by good nature. Admirably cast and directed by Producer Shumlin, The Male Animal js a gay evening in the theatre in spite of being no play at all.  John Henry (by Roark Braslford; music by Jacques Wolfe; produced by Sam Byrd) took Paul Robeson back to Broadway after nearly eight years. The stage seemed set for a great return.

To: From:  Subject:  PHILIP MORRIS INCORPORATED INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  100 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 owe 4 ° ‘| Y  - Mr. Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Date: Jahuary 18, 1974  » George Weissman  * Milprint Pulp Contract  The December meeting of the Board of Directors of Philip Morris Incorporated approved in principle authorization of a pulp contract to be signed by Milprint subject to clearing up two questions Legal raised. The Corporate Legal Depart~- ment has raised no further questions about the contract, and after speaking to each member of the Executive Committee, I have authorized Milprint to enter final negotiations with The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company for the purchase of 12,000 tons of pulp annually for ten years beginning in 1976.  Currently, Nicolet is paying $265.00 per ton. For purposes of calculation, it could be assumed that the pulp purchased under the proposed contract will cost approximately $300.00 per ton.  The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company, which is controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, has been a supplier to Nicolet for seven years. The relation- ship has been mutually satisfactory and Great Lakes' reputation is excellent.  The Milprint contract is a "take and pay" contract as are the others, and the financing of the new mill will be based on this paper. The mili will have a  capacity of 300,000 tons annually, 250,000 of which have already been committed to Milprint, Johnson and Johnson, Bergstrom Paper Company, National Cash Register, Proctor and Gamble, St. Regis Paper, Nekoosa Edwards, Fox River Paper and Landon  Paper.  The contract price will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase and although there is no contract guarantee that the price paid will be the lowest price available, pulp prices have traditionally been uniform within the industry. If the mill is not in operation by 1976, we can withdraw from the contract.  This annual 12,000 tons of pulp could be used in emergencies for flip top box and soft pack production for the Philip Morris tobacco operations.  Milprint will sign the contract since Nicolet is not a legal corporation. No guarantee will be required from Philip Morris.  At $300 per ton, this contract could total $36 million.

Thank you for your letter of February 7, 1964.  «quite a few of our friends have suggested or offered to disclose lines of research which might clarify the large gaps in existing knowledge of the relation of tobacco to health.  We want you to know we appreciate the constructive approach you and your client have adopted. However, we have thought it best not ourselves to engage in the type of research your letter. contemplates. Instead, since 1954 we have supported the Tobacoo Industry Research Committee, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17, New York, which has made grants totalling several million dollars to independent scientists engaged in a coordinated program of research into questions of tobacco use and health.

A detailed report will’ be -  available in late July.  Interviewing was undertaken in twelve northeastern cit4des among 404 menthol smokers and 102 young (18-24 years) Parliament smokers who occasionally smoke menthol cigarettes. The menthol smokers were broken out into the following groups:  o 147 full flavor king size smokers 0 161 flavor low king size smokers o 96 female flavor low 100’s smokers  The following points highlight the topline findings:  ° With the exception of the female 100’s smokers, Parliament Menthol did not appear to generate interest at the concept stage. Specifically, only one in ten of the Parliament and menthol king size smokers stated they would "definitely buy" the brand.  ° However, after trial, "definite" purchase interest levels doubled among both the king size and franchise smokers so that all four smoker groups exhibited similar levels of interest.  cc: D.

OF SMOG: PROPOSED  Five-Year U.S, Survey Asked -—Federal Aid to Localities Envisaged in Program  By BESS FURMAN  Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, June 11—A $25,000,000 five-year study of : “community air pollution" was; Proposed today by an interde- partmentat Federal committee  created last December.  The President had asked Mrs,. Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. to set up the committee after a’ group of California Congress- men had come to him with their: smog troubles.  The proposed $25,000,000 atudy would be much broader in. scope than one proposed in the bill for 2 $3,000,000 study, spon- sored by Senator Thomas H.| Kuchel, Republican of California. | This bill hag passed the Senate: and now is pending in the House j of Representatives. :  Closer to this plan is the smog bill sponsored by Senator Homer, E. Capehart, Republican of In-; diana, which set no ceiling on: appropriations for a broad-scale air pollution study. This bill also has passed the Senate, as a rider on the housing bill, .  House bills calling for Federal air pollution studies are spon- sored by John H, Ray, Repubti-. can of Staten Island, New York, - & locale which often gets the laden breezes irom the New Jer- sey industrial flats; by Repre-.      . sentatives Peter J. Frelinghuysen  Jr., Republican, and Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat, of New! Jersey; and by Representatives: Edgar W. Hiestand, Republican,: and James Roosevelt, Democrat,: of California,  The Interdepartmental Com-: mittee on Community Air Pol lution included representatives. of ; the Public Health Service of Mrs.: Hobby’s department; the Bureau. of Mines of the Interior Depart- ment; the Bureau of Standards/ and the Weather Bureau of the! Department of Commerce; the: Agricultural Research Service of the Department of Agriculture: the Office of Navy Research, De- partment of Defense; the Na- tional Science Foundation and the Atomic Energy Commission. Surgeon Generali Leonard A. Scheels of the Public Health Service served as chairman. Five meetings were held.     Permanent Group Urged  The committee recommended that the proposed anti-pollution program be administered by the  partment of Health, Educa- tion and Welfare with the assistance of 2 permanent inter- departmental committee repre- senting the departments and agencies that participated in the ad hoe deliberations.  It defined “community air pol- lution,” a term coined in distine- tion to industrial-site air pollu. tion and atomic fall-out as: “The presence in the ambient atmosphere of substances put there by the activities of man in concentrations sufficient to in- terfere directly or indirectly with his comfort, ‘safety or health, or with full use and en- Joyment of his property.”  The report specifically stated: “In general, it does not refer to the atmospheric pollution inci- dent to employment in areas where workers are employed, nor is it concerned with airborne agents of communicable disease, nor with overt or coverts acts of war.”  The responsibilities of the states and localities and of the Federa? Government in coping with this modern problem atso were defined by the committee.  Regulatory control of com- munity air pollution, its report stated, is the province of state and local governments, except with regard to radioactive air pollution resulting from opera- tions directly controlled by the Federal Government or inter-, State and international air pol- lution,  However, the report also} stated, the Federal Government should provide supplementary Support and assistance to state, local and other agencies includ-| ing private organizations in technical and operational Brab- lems or situations beyond their| cence ‘This ts the helpful role; en y the proposed $25,-| 000,000 program. .

SUMMARY:  Information concerning a cigarette made of papaya leaves was obtained through conversation with a man from Roswell Park Memorial Institute. This information has been verified and documented.  MEMORANDUM:  During the course of the banquet at the 18th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference, Mr. Raymond J. Shamberger of Roswell Park Memorial Institute offered the observation that he was smoking his "first tobacco cigarette in over a year."" Subsequent conversation revealed that he had been employed by a Los Angeles firm as a os biochemist to assist in developing a cigarette made of papaya leaves. This firm is backed by several very wealthy movie stars. The cigarette is to be marketed within a few months through the Frito-  Lay Corporation which is a nationwide distributor of food stuffs, particularly potato chips and Fritos.  Within the past year Mr. Shamberger was employed by Roswell Park Memorial Institute as a biochemist. He is one of a staff of  about 20 assigned to work on the question of tobacco and health.  Apparently studies of the papaya cigarette were (or are) also made at Roswell Park.  A subsequent check of the corporate structure of Frito-Lay (Standard and Poor, September 18, 1964) showed its relation to Sutton Research Corporation of Los Angeles "to conduct and evaluate consumers’ tests and technical research on a non-tobacco cigarette  made from papaya leaves. Frito-Lay has option to acquire 51% of Sutton."  Cc -  c6ec 0900S __label__Scientific

Botticelli  Alan Blum  It is somewhat difficult to give you anything definitive that Blum may bring up at the shareholders meeting, but I'l attempt a stab.  He's rather mercurial in his style, so he really can come up with anything. In the past, he has not been as combative as some of the other anti's (certainly not like the Connolly's, Slade's et al), and tries to come across as a "good" guy, often complimenting PM on its hospitality in Richmond, etc. I find him more an irritant, attempting to embarrass us, than, say, the institutional shareholders, who are pushing for dramatic change. This will be his seventh annual meeting.  He founded the group Doctors Ought to Care (DOC). It's a national physicians’ anti-tobacco group that is especially fond of protesting tobacco-sponsored sporting groups. It targeted Virginia Slims Tournament one year, calling it Emphysema Slims. DOC has been trying to bring in religious allies to its cause.  Blum likes to twist or exaggerate things. He has accused us of suborning the minority community. For example, he said the reason Blacks rarely criticized the tobacco industry on smoking and health issues was because we were “buying them off’ with our charitable contributions. Blum was also the person who, just before the 1992 Republican Convention, released our internal memoranda regarding political contributions. At the time he tried to embarrass us by saying that we are "buying" politicians with our PAC support and that Craig, as Convention Chairman, is further evidence of how we get to politicians. If we support a youth organization, he'll say our ulterior motive is really to get kids to smoke, or, if we sponsor a promotion, he'll say we are really trying to circumvent restrictions on TV advertising.  As far as I can recall, he has never put forward a shareholder resolution, but has seconded or commented on many others. We reviewed the transcripts of the past several years' annual meetings, and he has seconded or commented on the following resolutions - economic conversion (1994), cigarette advertising (1993), global warning labels (1993/91), marketing of Miller beer (1992/91), cigarettes and minors (1990). This year, I suspect he may be interested in Proposal 2 - ETS; maybe 3, primarily because it attempts to get us out of the tobacco business; and 5, economic conversion, since he seconded last year.

ee  ae  PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: - Mr. Leo Meyer Date: April 21, 1987 From: » Myron Johnston  Subject: . B&H King  At the March 13 meeting of the Benson and Hedges Task Force, I said I would look into the demographics of smokers of 80-85s who do not smoke our brands. I don’t think there is anybody in the company more enthusiastic than I about  the prospect of a B&H King (especially a menthol), and I have been pushing the idea at every opportunity for three or four years. Having said that, I  have to add a caveat: We have to be careful that we don’t shoot ourselves in the foot. We already own a good share of the nonmenthol 80-85 market.  Who Smokes Our Brands?  First a little background information. Figure 1 shows the total number of smokers, and the number who smoke a Philip Morris brand, by age of smoker and by length and type (menthol or nonmenthol) of cigarette. For all four length-type categories, @Q@esWar@ ST ‘market Ys: highest-anong the youngest# smokers and declines with age. Clearly this is the best position to be in, since there is a tendency for people to, stick within a brand name. This, combined with the increase in the absolute number of 18-34 year-olds from 1964 to 1984, is what fueled our growth in market share.      Figure 2 shows the total number of smokers of nonmenthol 80-85s and the number who smoke one of our brands, by age, sex, and race. Figure 3 shows the same data for menthols. I have deliberately put them both on the same scale to show the relative importance of menthols and nonmenthols among the various groups. Females are much more likely than males to smoke 100-120s, and, among males, blacks are more likely than whites to smoke 100-120s up to age 40, when the reverse becomes true. That explains the sex differences in the number of smokers of kings, and_some of the race differences. Also, as I have shown on many occasions, B¥eeks<avé mich wore Tikely than. whites £03 enoke “a henthol&  Who Doesn’t Smoke Our Nonmenthol 80-85s?  The areas vertically shaded in blue in Figures 2 and 3 can be considered windows of opportunity, with the size of the area directly proportional to the size of the opportunity. Quxcgreatest opportunities for nonmenthols. ‘exist among white males 25 to 54 and white females 35: to 44.4 Tt is inthe  ‘25-34 age group that males abandon Marlboro Red.

1991 PLAN NORTH DAKOTA  ROBERT E. FACKLER  SITUATION ANALYSIS  North Dakota has an 80 day state legislative session in 1991. Prefiling of bills took place December 4-6, 1990. A bill banning vending machines was prefiled.  The state excise tax on cigarettes was increased from .18 a pack to .27 in July of 1987. Taxes started the year at .30 per pack. A sunset provision taking place on 7/91 will lower the tax by .03 to .27 per pack.  1)  3)  4)  Cigarette Excise Tax Increase: It is likely that a bill to repea] the "Sunset Clause" that lowers the tax on cigarettes .03 per pack and is scheduled to take effect July 1, 1991 will be introduced. It would keep the tax on a pack of cigarettes at .30 per pack. There is also a strong anti-tax sentiment in ND. But a repeal of the Sunset Clause is an easier vote for the legislature than a new tax increase. For this reason, I feel it could pass. The SRGs wil] be working to fight the  repeal.  Other Tobacco Taxes: A bill increasing taxes on other tobacco products will likely be introduced. With the strong anti-tax sentiment in ND a vote for an increase in new taxes would be a much tougher vote than a repeal of the Sunset Clause. There is 50\50 chance of this one passing. Any Tax increase is unacceptable to the SRGs and they will be opposing it.  Smoking Restrictions: A Clean Indoor Air bill will likely be introduced. Some parts of it could very well pass. The SRGs have fought smoking restrictions in the past and will continue  to make this issue a priority.  Sampling Ban: There is a 50/50 chance that a bill will be  introduced. It is however, unlikely to pass. North Dakotan's are notorious for not wanting Government to interfere with the  business community.  on gS or  wal  ao G@  S __label__Report

1992 SECOND QUARTER REPORT  Timothy B. Nestor July 8, 1992  1. Evaluate the effects of air flow and’ oxygen concentration on ignition propensity. ” a. Develop an enclosure and evaluate effects of air flow. (2Q).,  Due to a change in priorities, work’ involving the "Localized Air Flow" apparatus*was delayed until late June. Currently, cigarettes G and J are being used to determine the appropriate levels of Kt on California standard fabric. Once the fabrics have been chosen, an « experiment willbe conducted using air flows of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 cm/sec.  b. Complete evaluation of O, effects at constant flow rate and flow effects at constant 0, on "Flow- Through" method with selected TSG cigarettes. (2Q)  The objective of this study was to determine whether the "Flow-Through" method could discriminate between selected  _ "remake" TSG cigarettes. Cigarettes 506 (BELN-21), 529 (FELC-25), 525 (FNLC+25), and 528 (FNHN-25) were selected for testing. These cigarettes represent a wide range of ignition propensities as reported by the TSG.  Ignition test results of cigarettes 506, 529, 525, and 528 on UFAC type II fabric at various air flow rates are shown in Table I. Ten replicates were run at each point and are represented by a percent ignition in the table (i.e. #/10). A well-defined differentiation between cigarettes was not observed. This can be seen in Figure I, a plot of percent ignitions versus air flow rate for all cigarettes. A formal analysis of variance has not been performed on the data; however, one could generalize that the cigarettes performed similarly at low flow rates, and cigarettes 525 and 528 produced more ignitions then 506 and 529 at the higher flow rates.  The results do not indicate a wide range of ignition propensities as reported by the TSG. Because of this, work involving various 0, percent has been postponed.  P8O@L LECTS __label__Report

2.2. Measurement and estimation of smoke dosage to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke  Martin J. JARVIS AND MICHAEL A. H. Russet  INTRODUCTION  Recent increased public awareness and con- cern about environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has derived from a number of epidem- iological studies which have suggested signifi-  _eant risks to the health of the exposed non-  stnoker. Some studies have found that young children with smoking parents have an increased risk of bronchitis and pneumonia, especially in the first year of life (1, 2). Adults chronically exposed to ETS have been reported to have impaired lung function (3) and an increased risk of lung cancer (4-6). The issue has provoked intense debate (7-9), and it is fair to say that the reality of the risks is not as yet generally accepted by the scientific commu- nity. One of the weaknesses of the studies so far performed is that they have not attempted to quantify the actual dose of ETS received by the non-smoker, although, as one critic has argued, this is fundamental to evaluation of the evi- dence (10).  Epidemiological investigation of the risks of ETS exposure would benefit from both a reti- able non-invasive marker and a validated ques- tionnaire for assessing the degree of exposure. While blood carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) has been found to be of use in short-term studies, it  is not specific to tobacco smoke and may not be sufficiently sensitive to reflect the totality of exposure across the whole range of situations occurring in daily life. Thiocyanate (SCN) may likewise suffer from a lack of specificity and sensitivity. Nicotine is specific to tobacco but has a short half life in plasma, and its major metabolite, cotinine, may provide a better guide.  The present paper addresses several issues on estimating the human dose of ETS. In the first section we present data relating to the validity of self-reports of ETS exposure and to the choice of biochemical marker for use in epidemiological surveys. We then document the smoke dose received from a short-term natural exposure, and in the final section relate this to blood and urinary nicotine levels resulting from slow intravenous infusion of small known doses of nicotine. This enables us to reach some conclusions about the dose received from ETS, as opposed to that received from smoking. These studies will be published in greater detail elsewhere.

TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  MEMORANDUM May 20, 1983  R. C. Young H. J. Minnemeyer  Outside Testing Budget  At the end of April the "Outside Testing" budget was underspent  by $323,  327. The seven activities itemized below, totaling  $351,720, generally account for underspending.  i.  Drug Enzyme Makeup ($30,000)  There has been an unexpected delay at Borriston Laboratories in implementing these tests on schedule.  Immunosuppression Studies ($4,000) Again, an unexpected delay at Borriston in implementing scheduled tests.  - Absorption-Distribution ($32,000):  There was a one month administrative delay at Research Triangle Institute as a new contract was initiated. This was followed by a further  2 month delay at Borriston Laboratories. We  do not know if it is possible to make up for lost time as these studies continue on a monthly basis.  CNS Activity Development ($7,500) This protocol development activity has not been initiated because of other commitments.                Acute Oral, 14-Day Subchronic, 90-Day Subchronic ($26,400) The test material (Dll, D12) was damaged in shipment. Then, Product Development changed the formula because of unanticipated problems with one of the ingredients. A new formulation has not been devised. During May and June budgeted charges amounting to $61,500 will not be accrued.     Skin Painting and Condensate Collection ($97,500) Mechanical equipment failure, technical delays, and delays due to price negotiations prevented the current study from starting as budgeted. In addition to the above, an additional shortfall of $35,000 will be incurred during May and June.  IZ°SL200 __label__Memo
I. NICOTINE OXIDATION BY CELL-FREE PREPARATIONS*  L. I. Hocusreint ano Sypney C. Rrrrenpero  1 ee ee From the Department of Bacteriology, Univeraity of Southern California, Los Angeles, California  (Received for publication, August 18, 1958)  Various pathways have been postulated for nicotine degrads,- tion involving an initis] attack at either the pyridine or the pyrrolidine rings. ‘The evidence for the suggested pathways has been provided mainly by the isolation of a variety of compounds from bacterial growth media (1, 2), tobacco seed infusions (3), fermented tobacco leaves (4), and the urine of animals that previously had been fed nicotine (5, 6). Unfortunately, because of the complexity of these systems it is not certain whether the isolated products are directly or indirectly derived from nicotine, nor is the sequence of their appearance clearly established. In an effort to avoid the difficulties inherent in the use of complex systems, studies of nicotine metabolisth were attempted st the enzyme level employing crude and fractionated extracts derived  from a bacterium. EXPERIMENTAL  The organism (designated as strain P-34) employed is a gram- negative rod isolated from soil by enrichment culture techniques. It is capable of using nicotine as its sole source of carbon and energy but ite growth is stimulated by yeast extract. It wag grown in a medium having the following composition in grams per 100 ml.: 3.33 K,HPO,.3Hy0, 0.4 KH:PO,, 0.1 (NH,)3S0,, 0.1 yeast extract, 0.4 nicotine, and the following trace salts; 0.01 MgSO.-7H,0, 0.002 CaCi,-2H.0, 0.004 MnSO,-4H,0, 0.0002 FeSO,.7H:0. The trace salts were dissolved in 0.1 N HCI at 100 times the fina! medium concentration, autoclaved, and added aseptically to the medium in the required amounts.  For the preparation of lange batches of cells, growth was car- ried out in 12-liter round bottom flasks containing 7 liters of mediuro. The inoculated medium was aerated with sterile air and incubated at room temperature. After the culture reached the maximum stationary phase (approximately 60 hours), the cells were harvested in a Sharples centrifuge. The unwashed cell paste was stored at -18° until needed. Yields were of the order of 6.5 gin. wet weight of cells per liter of medium.  Cell-free extracts were prepared according to the method of Mcliwain (7) by grinding a mixture of 10 gm. of partially thawed cells and 25 gm. of levigated alumina in 8 cold mortar. After grinding for 10 to 14 minutes at room temperature, the cell- alumina mixture became “tacky.” The resulting paste was extracted with 30 ml. of 0.01 m potassiam phosphate buffer, pH 7, for 15 minutes at room temperature and for 45 minutes at  * This work was supported by a grant from the Tobacco In- dustry Research Committee. Preliminary results were presented to the Society of American Bacteriologists, May 1957.  t Present address, Department of Medical Microbiology, Uni- versity of Southern California School of Medicine.  4°. The alumina, unbroken cells, and cell debrie were removed by centrifugation at 18000 x g for 60 minutes at 4°. The re- sulting clear yellow supernatant fluid constituted the crude ex- tract and contained, on the average, 22 mg. of protein per ml.  Ammonium gulfate fractionation of the crude extract was carried out at room temperature by the addition of the hequired amount of solid ammonium sulfate (8). After the addition of the ammonium sulfate, the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 4° for 10 minutes at 18000 x g. The super- natant solution was decanted, the pellet drained by inversion and dissolved in 0.01 »¢ potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7; to give & final volume of approximately one-fourth that of the starting crude extract. All ensymatic fractions were stored at —15° if not used immediately.  Ultraviolet absorption spectra were determined with a Beck- man model DU spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures were prepared for spectrophotometry by adding them to 2 volumes of 0.1 ~s HCl, removing the precipitated protein by centrifugation, and, if required, diluting the clear supernatant solution with additional 0.1 x HCI.  Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were determined by conventional manometric techniques (10).  Reaction mixtures were chromatographed on Whatman No. 1 paper by the ascending technique. The solvent was an 85:5:30 mixture of n-butanol, bensene, and 0.2 a1 sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6 (11). The alkaloids were located by exposing the dried chromatograms to cyanogen bromide vapors for 1 hour followed by spraying with #-naphthylamine (a Koenig's reaction), by ultraviolet absorption under a Mineralite lamp, or by treating  the paper with Dragendorff’s reagent.'  Oxidation of Nicotine by Crude Extracts Crude extracts pre- pared from several independently grown batches of cells usually oxidized nicotine at a slow but definite rate. The amount of oxygen consumed varied from extract to extract and in many cases no oxidation was observed. Furthermore, fresh extracts which oxidised nicotine lost this ability upon storage at ~ 18°,  : Prepared by mixing & parts of solution A (0.85 gm. of bismuth subnitrate, 40 ml. of distilled water, and 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid) with 5 parte of solution B (8 gm. of potassium iodide in 20 ml. of distilled water), and adding 20 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 100 ml. of distilled water.  151  PUBLICATIONS  034276 __label__Scientific

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.  TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017  Herb Foster May 27, 1987  Nancy Gurry Virginia Slims Ultra Lights  This report updates Virginia Slims Ultra Lights most recent performance in the Memphis and San Francisco test markets. Several data sources will be referenced in order to provide a thorough analysis: Factory Shipments, ICC, Retail Audits, and SPACE. Factory shipments were jnitiated 1/22/87 with availability at retail effective 2/27/87.  Memphis  Shipment data reflect that Virginia Slims Ultra Lights registered a 0.6 S.0.M. based on recent four week period ending 5/15/87. Share was virtually evenly distributed with Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Regular displaying a 0.27 share and Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Menthol contributing 0.31 share points.  At the distributor level, the brand's 4 week rolling averages have continually grown, currently residing at a 0.8 level (w/e 4/24) -- equivalent to shipment data at that point in time.  Retail data, reflecting a 50 store panel located in the Memphis trading area, are positioned at the 1.5 level based on the recent four week period ending 4/26. The Ultra Light Regular and Menthol levels were basically equal exhibiting a respective 0.7 and 0.8 S.0.M. The Ultra Low Tar line extension currently attains a similar share in pack outlets (S.0.M: 1.6) compared to performance in carton outlets (S.0.M: 1.4) based on the current four week period. While the retail share data in this report appear to be overstated in the two test markets, these levels are at parity with share of smoker data reported by Consumer Research, derived from a survey during week 10 after introduction.  In the audit panel, Virginia Slims Ultra had a distribution level of 83% for the two week period ending 4/13 -- down -7 versus the prior two weeks. Of the 83% carrying, 5% reported being completely 00S of the brand. During the next two weeks, distribution increased to the 86%  level and none of the stores reported 00S.  SPACE continues to report an availability of 85% as of w/e 5/08/87 -- at parity with the audit panel.  VWseseoage  Als __label__Memo

Vol. 14, No. 1, 1964 BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS  . 1 NUCLEAR RIBOSOMES, AN EARLY FACTOR IN TISSUE HKEPARATION  Se Gudbjexnason and C. De Schryver Department of Medicine  Wayne State University College of Medicine and Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan  Receaved October 16, 1963  The role of cytoplasmic ribosomes in protein synthesis has been studied extensively in the past; more recent discoveries suggest (NolLA et al, 1963) that the functional units or protein synthesis are ribosomal aggregates, "ergosomes", consisting of particles held together by m-RNA. The origin of cytoplasmic ribosomes is a matter of some speculation but a current favorite is thet ribosomal RNA is synthesized in the nucleus.  The purpose of our report is to present some data which indicate that nuclear ribosomes are labeled earlier than cytoplasmic microsomes during tissue reparation, suggesting nuclear origin of the cytoplasmic microsomes. The studies were carried out on subcellular fractions of infarcted and normal cardiac muscle.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Myocardial infarction was produced in dogs by ligation of  branches of the anterior descending coronary artery, so that a homo~- geneous infarct was obtained. Glycine-2-cl4 (specific activity 15.1 mc/mMol) was injected  intravenously, 30 gic per kg body weight. The animals were sacrificed     2 this work was supported by Grant No. H-5043 from the U.S. Public Health Service, The American Heart Association, The Michigan Heart Association, Life Insurance Medical Research Fund, Tobacco Industry  Research Committee, The Burroughs-welicome Fund, and The John A.» Hartford Foundation.  12  PUBLICATIONS 004251 __label__Scientific

THE 1986 BERNARD B. BRODIE AWARD LECTURE  The Genetic Regulation of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes  DANIEL W. NEBERT  Chief, Laboratory of Developmental Pharmacology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health  I feel very honored, indeed, and also very humble, to have the privilege of joining my four esteemed colleagues (1-4) in being named as recipient of the fifth Bernard B. Brodie Award in Drug Metabolism. I thank the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (administrators of this award) and the CIBA-GEIGY Corp. (sponsors of this award) for their recognition of my studies on the genetic regulation of drug- metabolizing enzymes. My training began in the laboratories of Howard 5. Mason, and then Harry Gelboin, who both helped me in choosing the direction of my future studies. I am thankful for my association during the subsequent 18 years with numerous talented colleagues and collaborators without whose skill, hard work, creativity, and continued support and friendship the work lam about to describe would not have been possible. Although their contributions are well documented in the literature, there are several individuals whose contributions are not. One of these is Ernst Caspari, in 1959 with The Department of Biology, Wesleyan University, Middletown CT, who inspired me to think that “there can be little sense to biology, except in the context of genetics and evolution.” Two others include Mort B. Lipsett, previous Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD), and Arthur S. Levine, Sci- entific Director of the NICHHD, who helped create the environ- ment needed for the pursuit of innovative basic research. The other individual is my wife, Kathleen Dixon, who has critically reviewed many of my publications since 1981, and who gave birth to two beautiful, healthy twin boys the same day that John Schenkman informed me of my being recipient of the Brodie Award.  This paper is directed at the graduate student and beginning postdoctoral fellow. I wish to illustrate the chain of events in my career—how the thinking in my laboratory led to the design of an experiment, and how our interpretation of new data led to the next hypothesis. At each point in time, of course, develop- ment of the next experiment was heavily influenced by the prevalent thinking, the skill and creativity of my postdoctoral fellows and collaborators, and the techniques available.  Genetic Locus Defined, The metabolism of carcinogenic poly- cyclic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene, was known 2 dec- ades ago to be carried out by a P-450 enzyme, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH).' We had found that it was possible to study in cell culture the regulation of AHH activity—including induc- tion by benzo[aJanthracene, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D (5-9). The induction, by polycyclic hydrocarbons, of an enzyme that metabolized polycyclic hydrocarbons, seemed very exciting because of its relevance to human environmentally caused cancer  This paper is dedicated to the memory of Mort B. Lipsett (1921-1985), whose enthusiastic support as a friend and administrator | shall never forget.  " Abbreviations used are: AHH, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase; BP, benzo[a] pyrene; MC, 3-methytcholanthrene; TCDD, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; UDPGT,, UOP-glucuronosyitransferase; NMOR,, NAD(P)H:meadione oxido reductase; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism.  and toxicity. The induction of an enzyme by many of its sub- strates also appeared to be very important in fundamental studies of eukaryotic gene regulation.  A survey of AHH inducibility among several inbred mouse strains (10) therefore “seemed like a neat idea” for several rea- sons. (i) As Severo Ochoa noted, “All things being equal, it is better to have a biologic mutant than not to have a biologic mutant.” {ii} In 1969, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and toxicity were just beginning to be measurable in tissue culture. The intact mouse thus promised to be a better model for the study of pathophysiologic effects of environmental chemicals. (iii) The observations of genetic differences in the mouse can most likely be extrapolated to human disease caused by the metabolism of environmental carcinogens and toxic chemicals, A survey of several inbred mouse strains (10) revealed a fundamental differ- ence (table 1) between C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice. 3- Methylcholanthrene (MC) treatment increased hepatic AHH activity more than 6-fold in B6 but not D2 mice. A 2-nm spectral shift in the reduced P-450-CO complex was also seen in MC- treated B6 but not D2 mice. The B6-D2 difference was not observed following phenobarbital treatment. One interpretation of the table 1 data is that MC treatment of B6 but not D2 mice might lead to the appearance, or large increase, of at least one new P-450 protein; alternatively, MC might cause a decrease in one or more other proteins, unmasking an already existing P- 450 protein in B6 but not D2 mice. Why does the B6 mouse, when presented with a polycyclic hydorcarbon stimulus, respond with an increase in polycyclic hydrocarbon metabolism while the D2 mouse does not? The rest of my career to date has been devoted to gaining a better understanding of this observation.  We first wondered what would happen if the genetically “re- sponsive” B6 mouse were crossed with the genetically “nonres- ponsive” D2 mouse. The lack of AHH induction was found to be inherited as a Mendelian autosomal recessive trait (11) [al- though the inheritance of this trait appeared to be more compli- cated when we studied crosses between other inbred mouse strains (12)]. Moreover, inheritance of this trait was found in  TABLE 1  Aryl hydrocarbon (benzofajpyrene) hydroxylase (AHH) from liver microsomes of control and drug-treaied mice  AHH Specific Activity x        Sean Col 3-Methylcholanthrene* Phenobarbital’ ¢CO-reduced) pmol/min}mg protein am B6 400 450 2500 448 1000 450 D2 400 450 400 450 1000 450     * Eighty mg per kg of body weight for 2 days.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.  Inter Office Correspondence        DATE: June 28, 1995 TO: Philip Morris USA Sales Force  FROM: Craig Johnson  SUBJECT: Sales' Role in Action Against Access  As you know, PM USA is embarking on a far-reaching new initiative, “Action Against Access" to address the problem of youth smoking. The principle of the program is: “The best way to keep kids away from cigarettes is to keep cigarettes away from kids.” The PM USA Sales Force will be playing a pivotal role in ensuring the success of this comprehensive program.  Here are some of our immediate responsibilities.  . Effective immediately, we will discontinue free cigarette sampling to consumers.  ° Effective immediately, we will not distribute cigarettes through the mail.  * We will deny merchandising benefits to stores which are fined for or convicted of selling cigarettes to minors.  ° Before announcing Action Against Access, we were involved in placing minimum age signs and related materials provided by PM USA's "Ask First/It's the Law" educational program in more than 200,000 retail outlets across the country. Rapid placement of that material has become a basic element of Action Against Access, and placement is thus elevated to a priority assignment for the PM USA Sales Force. :  ° Bach member of the Sales Force must remain vigilant as we intensify our aggressive efforts to prevent the use of Philip Morris cigarette brand names or logos on any item marketed to minors, including video games and toys.  denial of merchandising benefits to retailers who are fined  eo so oe oe fae One of the strictest sanctions of Action Against Access is J or for or convicted of selling cigarettes to minors.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Disturbances in hematopoiesis is a characteristic clinical finding in patients with AIDS. Patients present with abnormalities in one or more lineages resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The mechanisms by which HIV causes these disturbances are not known but are critical to an understanding of the hematologic pathobiology of the virus and the clinical management of patients with AIDS. In this grant, we propose to examine the molecular basis for our published findings of two mechanisms by which HIV can cause disturbances in hematopoiesis: direct suppression of progenitor cell growth and differentiation; and a negative effect on the accessory hematopoietic support function (HSF) of stroma cells. Using a murine embryonic stem cell (ES) line, as a model for stem cell development, and human stroma cell lines, transfection experiments will focus primarily on the role of the vpr regulatory gene in altering the developmental and functional properties of these hematopoietic cells. This focus is based on the observation: that vpr transfected into a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line can induce its differentiation. Thus, vpr may cause a disruption of the carefully regulated and coordinated processes of proliferation and differentiation that occurs during the development of progenitor cells into mature and functional progeny. A disruption in the function of stroma cells may similarly be affected by the activity of the vpr gene.  In their paper on HIV induction of rhabdomyosarcoma muscle celi line differentiation, Levi and co- workers showed that HIV expression leads to inhibition of the muscle cell's proliferation and the activation of the dormant endogenous differentiation Program. The effect was mediated by the regulatory vpr gene of the virus with its protein acting as a regulator of cell function. In discussing the implications of these findings, the authors speculate that “stem cell populations (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, hematopoietic pre- cursors) are disrupted by vor and lose the ability to replenish tissues, leading to a gradual decline of mature effector population." Since some viruses can activate cellular genes in a variety of cells, it is reasonable to examine whether HIV regulatory genes can induce changes in the normal pattern of gene expression in hematopoietic progenitor celts and the accessory Cell function of stroma cells. Such an approach may provide evidence for the dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation as a mechanism of bone marrow suppress- ion, The authors also postulate that “cells that are subject to abortive infection, owing to an inability of the cells to support virus replication, nevertheless might be dysregulated by the activities of vpr.". Thus, non- productively infected cells of tissues that are not the usual targets of HIV in vivo, but are afflicted in AIDS patients, may be dysregulated in the absence of reverse transcription, integration, or residual viral nucleic acid. This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect on progenitor cells in in vivo studies while in vitro experiments demonstrate that progenitor cells can be infected by HIV and their growth impaired. Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically, the yardstick by which a cell's tropism for HIV is measured, it is possible that abortive infection of a cell that is not the usual target of the virus can still alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in vitro following infection by hepatitis B virus correlates with only a transient replication of the virus in bone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells may not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences on their development and function.  Our first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The mouse embryonic siem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell line that has the Capacity to develop into every tissue type when injected into host blastocysts. As such, it has become a valuable tool in the study of hematopoiesis and its molecular biology, and so will be used as a developmental model of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the role of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficult. Since ES cells are a pure population of truly totipotential cells, they can be used to gain insight into the biological significance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular processes that occur during the early events of commitment, self-renewal, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, in vitro techniques have been developed to study hematopoietic cell differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and pattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consistent and reproducible. Thus, the expression of genes involved in the early stages of hematopoiesis precede those required for the terminal stages of differentiation. Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a distorted profile of gene expression. These observations are relevant to the proposed study. Finally, based on our studies on studies of the vav proto-oncogene, genes of particular interest can be readily and stably  50647413 __label__Scientific

3-27-81  Dr. Vincent Lisanti  The Council for Tobacco Research ~ USA, Inc. 110 E. 59th Street  New York City, NY 10022  Dear Dr. Lisanti:  Jack Frankel asked that 1 write to you with regard to two points on the coefficient, Yule's Q.  Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most conventional measure of association, Pearson's Product-moment Corre- dation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively.  Pearson's r isbased on the product moments for each data point represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted sum of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore requires interval scals measuring the variables.  In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points on the scales. Only two points are represented for each variable (e.g. - high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack).  A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F. Schuessler, Statistical Reasoning in Sociology, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1961, pp 242-249.     Sincerely,  Richard J. Gagan, PhD  14705 Carnation Dr Tampa, FL 33612  50135293 __label__Letter

Osmalov  Discussions with Max Hatisermann  My discussions with Dr. Hattsermann covered the following areas:  1. Fluted plastic tip: on the Parliament 100 2. Flush fluted filter development program 3. Microreticulated polymer program  In regard to the fluted Parliament 100 tip, our discussion was very brief. Dr. Hatisermann stated that the various  ‘filter components he tad requested from us and Manufacturing  had been received. He was Specifically interested in learning more details about the cutter designs used on the dual  combiner and cigaret assembler. I. referred him to Manufacturing for details,  Dr. Hatisermann stated that FTR was extremely interested in getting ouf an entirely new product and it was his feeling that the flush fluted filter could provide the basis for such a cigaret. I showedi him the extrusion process. and later dis- cussedi the benefits to be derived when this type filter was used in combination with a carbon on tow. inner plug, e.g., Philip Morris Multifilter type. Dr. Haiisermann indicated  that FTR would probably be interested in purchasing an extrusion line. I obtained from Gatto the name of their German subsidiary from which equipment, identical to ours, could be purchased, (Later in the day Dr. Seligman suggested! that FTR might be able-to: arrange a transfer of one of Manufacturing's extrusion lines: to Switzerland and then order another line  for themselves, He suggested Dr. Waltz explore this possibility through proper company channels.) If they do obtain a line  Dr. Halisermann suggested that I go to Switzerland to assist them in starting up their process. (I HEARTILY. CONCUR! )  Dr, Halisermann said that FTR would pay all my expenses,  I discussed with Dr, Hatisermann the devellopment of our PVC filter material and the problems we: were having with scaling the process from lab to pilot stage. We discussed in some detail possible approaches for cooling the fused material.  He: felt that cooling the material on a belt containing molds of the same basic configuration as our quartz tubes was a good approach.

I.  II.  4 Lo pd), |fe  MANAGEMENT SUMMARY ‘_- IN REM SECRET  - No._225_ By. Background History  REAL FILTER and MENTHOL were introduced nationally on 6/13/77, 4 months ago. REAL is positioned in the fast-growing Hi-Fi category as the only major brand with "nothing artificial added" -- capitalizing on recent consumer interest in all-natural products  to differentiate the Brand from all other cigarettes. Based on pre~- market concept research, low "tar" and good taste are the consumer benefits which make the Brand important to consumers. The Brand is targeted to young adults, especially males, with emphasis on a rich, masculine tone in advertising--on judgment, distinctly unique versus  the more “clinical" pack/copy approach used by the leading Hi-Fi brands (VANTAGE and Merit). Pre-market research indicated strong  and broad-based appeal for REAL, so it received very heavy intro- ductory spending support to capitalize on this potential.           Business Review     REAL's performance thus far in 1977 has been disappointing. Shipments forecasted for total year 1977 are only 66% of the original goal:  Total Year 1977     Volume SOM  Original Goal 3.64 bil. 6%  ‘Current Forecast 2.40 bil.* 4% (¢ of Goal) ; (66%)  * Inflated by an estimated net pickup from retailers/ jobbers of 200 million units. Given a heavy initial load-in and lower than expected movement, pickup was required to balance inventories and assure fresh product.  Although REAL's spending in 1977 was at a significantly high rate versus previous RJR new brand introductions, its impact was some- what diluted by the national introduction of 19 competitive new brand items (all low "tar") during the year. Importantly, Merit's first year expenditures accounted for a greater share of both low "tar" category and new brand expenditures than did REAL's.  REAL ; Merit July-Dec. 1977.

SPECIAL CIGARETTES FOR MARKETING DEPARTMENT  I. Brothers Filter  a. Mold Modifications  The design of the Brothers Filter has been modified on both the exterior and interior of the filter.  The exterior of the filter has been modified in order to improve performance of the filter on the filter making machine and to obtain a design which would be different from the outside of the Parliament mouthpiece. The original structure of the serrated Brothers Filter was such that when cigarettes were made the serrated plug meshed with the roll drum on the making machine and resulted in creasing of the  tipping. Three approaches have been tried to eliminate this:  (1) The section of the roll drum under the filter was filled to give a smooth surface. The creasing effect was eliminated but tipping was wrinkled in spots.  (2) The number of serrations was reduced from 18 to 10 in order to avoid meshing. This eliminated creasing and this type filter will be evaluated more extensively on the making machine.  (3) The outside structure has been designed to give a diamond shaped pattern. A sam- ple of these filters has been shipped and will be tested this: week.     £988 6L7Z0S __label__Report

' Frem:  Date: Subject:  Ta:  2083204707 Page 1 Note for Smith, Dee Smith, Dee Wed, Nov 24, 1993 2:09 PM COLLECTOR'S CHOICE VERNON CHEEK Hi, Vernon,  As the Collector's Choice saga becomes more confusing, I feel compelled to document a portion of it lest we become overwhelmed by superfluous details.  Originally, we were going to add Red Express to the Skyline Series of  C. Choice. We had agreed that the only change to the case UPC would be  the alpha letter "A" in place of the zero in code 1950. This application  of alphas would change with each new pack replacement in the carton series. (Are we together so far?) Red Express was to be added to the Skyline Series. That, however, was yesterday. Today, 11/24/93, Red Express is being added to the Vista Series (code 1690). This change is being made because the Princeton University is being adversarial about the use of the Princeton name on a pack of cigarettes.  As I remember our conversation prior to your vacation, this change from the full flavor series to the lights series doesn't matter in trademark names. So it's perfectly all right for us to switch the series in which the Red Express brand will appear. As I see it, this means that the 1690 code with now become 169A. This will represent the new Vista carton which will lose Princeton and gain Red Express and so on and so on and so on.  This has been a great catharsis and you are a wonderful sounding board. Hope you enjoyed your vacation.  Dee __label__Email

Savoca FROM: T. A. Perfetti  BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM     o Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening, in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables.  CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM  o FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models  Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have  been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for the following smoker groups testing RJR products:  FF competitive smokers  FF franchise smokers FFLT competitive smokers  FFLT franchise smokers  o0o000  The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented  at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.  o FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models     Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200 additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These  additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been  completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.  o Consumer Test Data Base  Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on 292 CT tests has been catalogued.  © Review of Competitive Brand Test Results  Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into effect as of September, 1984.     6SLb 680g __label__Letter

Two Indoor Air Quality Investigations -- Oceans Apart  Simon Turner Healthy Buildings International Inc. (HBI) 10378 Democracy Lane Fairfax, Virginia 22030 U.S.A.  INTRODUCTION  A commonly seen method of indoor air evaluations in buildings perceived as “sick" involves an engineering study of a building in conjunction with a questionnaire administered to its occupants. As a result we now have evidence that tighter, air conditioned buildings generate higher incidence of upper respiratory complaints than naturally ventilated buildings.':? However, this combination of engineering evaluation and occupant questionnaire as a diagnostic method for sick buildings has not provided us with the ability to predict the cause of indoor air problems from occupant symptoms.  One major reason for this appears to be that many common irritants found in indoor air result in a similar range of upper respiratory symptoms. Many diagnosed “sick" buildings are reported to have their causes rooted in ventilation, filtration or hygiene problems which allow a mixture of low level pollutants to build up 2-4 These irritate occupants in a complex and possibly synergistic manner, the mechanism of which is largely unknown to us.  To demonstrate the range of engineering characteristics which can produce similar complaints of sick building syndrome, this paper presents two case histories of identically sized buildings, the studies of which were completed in July of 1989. One of these buildings (designated as Building A) was located in Washington D.C., and the other (designated as Building 3) was located in San Diego, California. Both buildings are 600,000 square feet in size and a full description of their respective characteristics is found in the results section.  Symptomology  The following symptoms were reported in Building A during the year previous to this study: sneezing and/or coughing; sinus congestion; dry nasal passages; post nasal drip; rashes amd dry skin; headache; breathing difficulties; sore throat; drowsiness; fatigue; eye irritation. In Building 5 the following complaints were noted over the same period of time: odors; headaches; shortness of breath; eye irritation; dizziness. These symptoms in both buildings compare well with the classic symptomology of the sick building syndrome as defined in the Commission of the European Communities Report -- Sick Building Syndrome, A Practical Guide) which lists the symptoms as follows: nasal irritation with nasal stuffiness; dryness and irritation of the mucous membrane of the eye; dryness and irritation of the throat; skin dryness and irritation; headaches, generalized lethargy and tiredness.

Wu, Ph.D. Dept of Biochemsitry  University of North Texas Denton, TX 76203  Dear Dr. Wu:  Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal. To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for which support is sought. It should contain the following information:  1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.  2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken. .  3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. :  It would also be helpful to have:  1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.  2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.  Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for "fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30;  activation is typically seven months later.

Thompson  ‘S/M Assay - DBC Burley(BU): Control vs DBC BU Treated     Four smokings of three samples were submitted by you for testing in the S/M assay (1). The objective of this study was to determine if the enzymatic treatment of tobacco by Genecor to remove insoluble proteins would lower the  S/M activity. For this experiment, DBC BU (control) was treated with Pronase®  and washed, also BU was sham treated; i.e., washed only. IT CSCs from the flour smokings of these handmade cigarettes. were tested in stnain TA98+S9 (2).     The preparation of the CSCs (10 mg/ml) was carried out by Charge No. 6908 personnel (3). The CSCs were stored at -80°C until tested. All of the CSCs were tested randomly at doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20: mg/plate according to the standard test procedures (4):  All of the control data (see addendum) were within normal ranges. except for 2AA which was slightly lower than normal. Each test sample demonstrated a dose-response and produced a response that was 2X background.  Table 1 illustrates the specific activity (S.A.) of the four smokings and also the analysis of variance (performed using, "Minitab"). At the p>0.05 ‘level of significance, the S.A.s of both the treated and sham treated samples were lower than the DBC BU control. While this result implites that the S/M activity can be lowered by just sham treatment or washing the tobacco, Table l also shows a significant difference in the S.A.s of the treated and sham treated; i.e., the S.A. of the Pronase® treated sample is lower. Since these data indicated that enzymatic treatment of tobacco can significantly lower S/M activity, further studies in this area may be warranted. It would be useful to also have complete filler analysis for these test samples, especially for total N and cations; however, this data was not available fior this experiment. It is recommended that such analyses be included ini any future studies.     The €SCs yields (mg/cigt)i and calculated total activities (T.A.) are reported in Table 2. Analysis of variance was also perfiormed for the T.A. data. The difference in T.A. between the treated and sham treated samples was due to the higher S.A. of the sham treated (Table 1) and not the CSC yield, since the yield of both sets of samplies are nearly equall (Table 2).

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  TO: Field Sales Force DATE: April 13, 1995  FROM: Craig Johnson/Senior VP, Sales SUBJECT: Ask Fir It's the Law (5/30 - 7/2  Selling cigarettes to minors is against the law. It's that simple. While PM USA does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers, PM USA has always advocated that retail accounts comply with the law.  One of the ways to further support the Company's commitment regarding restricting the sale of cigarettes to minors is to reinforce this principle with our accounts and their employees. Importantly, retailers nationwide have been asking us for assistance in complying with their state laws.  As a result, we are providing you with enhanced program materials to use with your accounts. These program materials were successfully tested in Cincinnati in the fourth quarter of 1994. Our focus with accounts begins in June and July, with continuous program support in the balance of 1995. Program details are outlined below.  Current Situation The law holds retailers responsible for selling tobacco products legally. Retailers that sell cigarettes  to minors may be subject to fines, a loss of their licenses and possibly even jail time.  Key _ Issue How do we help to inform and educate retailers and their employees regarding their responsibilities  to enforce their state laws?  The Plan In June and July, place the "Ask First/It's the Law" program in all workload accounts during normal  call coverage. Then continue to place materials during 1995, making this part of your in-store mission.  Here's How _it Works * Selli idelin - Sell the program to all accounts as a value-added service, beginning May 30 , 1995  - Thoroughly review the program materials to ensure that retailers understand their responsibilities.  - A copy of the Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story is enclosed and can be accessed via the Si Support-File Server in the folder entitled "Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story."

Brice/Don: we need to make some decisions quick. while sue has verbally committed, the  magazines will want to have hard insertion orders to absolutely guarantee positions such as centerspread, and so Sue can negotiate the best up-front position for our insert where centerspread doesn't apply. as soon as LHC can issue the orders, the better.  So we have to make some decisions and need approval as quickly as we can get it on the list and the number of insertions. (wow -- 80.5MM circulation -- that's 'mighty tasty!)

SIRIUS-A contained 1.9 percent glycerol, 1.4 percent propylene glycol, and 0.8 percent triethylene glycol. SIRIUS-B contained 2.3 percent glycerol, 1.7 percent propylene glycol, and no triethylene glycol. The total humectant concentra- tion in the filler of both research cigarette types waS approx. 4 percent. The standard reference cigarette 2R1 was used as an in-  ternal control.  3 METHOD  The study was performed according to INBIFO standard operating procedures. Three MWS and 3 SWS doses were administered. For MWS, the doses were between 0.2 and 1.0 "milligrams" TPM per flask and for SWS between 0.1 and 0.6 "milligrams" TPM per flask. There were  4 cultures per dose group.  2062090416  9490 __label__Scientific
Mortality Data: How Reliable? How Accurate?  For many years, the U.S. and other countries have compiled "vital statistics" to monitor and study the health Status of their populations. Included in these vital statis- tics are numbers of deaths, usually. .classified by cause. Such mortality data can be useful in identifying and evaluating trends in specific diseases, in setting health research priorities, and, by way of epidemiological studies, in sug- gesting factors that may be associated with certain diseases. It is obvious that for valid conclusions to be drawn from these types of statistical studies, mortality data must have a  high degree of reliability.  Sources of Mortality Data: Death Certificates  Mortality data generally come from death certificates. AS a result, scientists and statisticians have been concerned with the quality of this source of information. Some comments from the medical and scientific literature!~4 indicate the  depth of concern:  It has become obvious that in many cases the diagnosis on a death certificate may have  actually no bearing whatsoever or any rela- 7) tion to the cause of death of a given patient.  Disquiet exists about the accuracy of the diagnostic information contained in the  medical certificate of cause of death even in  cases when a full post-mortem examination is carried out.  eeos 7900S  91  owe __label__Report

-63- Schoendorf and Kiely (1992)  The first study to independently examine maternal smoking during and after pregnancy  - was published by Schoendorf and Kiely (1992). They performed a case-control analysis of data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Within this dataset, 201 black and 234 white autopsied SIDS cases were identified from death certificates; approximately 3,000 controls for each race were used. The analysis was restricted to infants weighing >2,500 grams at birth. Mothers were questioned regarding their level of cigarette consumption during pregnancy and at the time of interview, and from their responses categorized as nonsmokers, smokers after pregnancy only, or smokers during and after pregnancy. After adjustment for maternal age, education, and marital status, maternal smoking only after pregnancy had an OR of 1.8 (CI 1.0, 3.0) for whites and 2.3 (C1 =1.5, 3.7) for blacks. The risk of SIDS among infants of women who smoked both during and after pregnancy was 3.1 (CI =2.3, 4.2) and 3.1 (CI =2.2, 4.3) for whites and blacks respectively. The ORs for “passive” (postnatal) and “combined” (pre- and postnatal) exposure were not directly comparable, as mothers who smoked during and after pregnancy tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than mothers who smoked only after pregnancy. The authors also examined the risk of SIDS in relation to the presence of other smokers in the household. In whites, household smoking was significantly associated with SIDS (OR=1.4, CI=1.0, 1.9), but no relationship was seen in blacks (OR=0.9, CI 0.7, 1.3). This latter analysis controlled for mother's smoking status only.  Mitchell et al, (1993)  Final results from the New Zealand case-control study were published in Mitchell ef al. (1993). The study's catchment area covered 78% of all live births in New Zealand during the 3-year study period. Four hundred eighty-five SIDS cases were compared to 1,800 controls. Case infants were much more likely than were control infants to have mothers who had smoked in the two weeks prior to interview (OR=4.1, CI=3.3, 5.1). The OR decreased to 1.7 (CI=1.2, 2.3) but was still significant at the p=0.05 level after adjusting  for: region, season, breastfeeding, and bed sharing; mother's marital status, socioeconomic  EXTERNAL REVIEW DRAFT MARCH 1995  | | SA6ZSVELSOS |  { ‘ __label__Scientific

aa  t  .  RJR R&D Statistical Support  InterOffice Memorandum  SUBJECT: Visible Sidestream Smoke Measurement DATE: January 24, 1985  TO: Joe Inman FROM: Michael J. Morton  Brand R&D  INTRODUCTION  Sidestream smoke measurements were taken on 52 products: 11 prototype products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurements were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures reported were visible absorbance values. Each number reported is the  average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the sidestream smoke measures. Forty-five products were measured on one device  and the remaining 7 were measured on the other. Some products, a monitor product and NOW 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in  the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance.  The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the ll prototype products give off less visible sidestream smoke than all of the 41 commer- cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurement devices and the visible sidestream smoke values for all products in the  study were compared.  I will first deseribe the results of a comparison between the two measure- ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that was made among the 52 products.  DEVICE COMPARISON  An analysis of variance on the two measurement devices showed an average difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines. (The newer machine read about .0178 lower than the original machine.) That difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two machines, but it is not statistically significant at the standard level. The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigarettes that were used to monitor the machines. The difference was .0185 units for the so-called Monitor product (whieh had an average absorbance of about +75) and -0170 units for NOW 85 (which had an average absorbance of about .54).  In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assum- ing that the two devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis- tinguishable from the other products is not changed according to which as- sumption is made.  8£04 STé6Qag __label__Letter

RJR INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  June 11, 1984  To: Mr. G. H. Long From: Bob Di Marco  Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure     Jerry:  Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a working team composed of representatives from various departments who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to- day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn, reports to a Steering Committee composed of Hudnall Christopher, Harry Lees, Dale Sisel, and me. This Steering Committee was originally charged with coordination of domestic and internation- al efforts on TSB/TCF. Recently, a Worldwide Coordination Com- mittee has been formed to coordinate RJRT, RJRTI, and McCann- Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology. The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.  A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar Structure. While coordination across departments is necessary, too much of its exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to’ replace the TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and other technologically driven new product projects as well.  Features of this plan are as follows:  o The current TSB Steering Committee and TSB Task Force will be eliminated. RJRT Executive Officers will continue to receive reports on TSB and other new product projects.  o RJRT/RJRTI/McCann~Erickson efforts on TSB will continue to be coordinated through the Worldwide Coordination Committee.  o A New Products!' Steering Committee will be formed to deal with both TSB and TGA. Permanent members of this Committee will include RJRT representatives of R&D, New Brands Marketing, Marketing Development, Process Technology and Development, and Law.

-19-  APR 19 196  t THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1995  Black Teeti-Agers Are Turning Away From Smoking, but Whites Puff On     By PHILIP J. HILTS  ASHINGTON, April 18 - African-American teen-agers have large- ly eliminated smoking  from their lives, while white teen- agers are still taking up the habit at high rates, according to a study re- ported in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.     “This is the singte most interest-  ing change in the use of tobacco in years: the success of black teens,” said Dr. Michael Eriksen, chief of the Office on Smoking and Health at  . the Federai Centers for Disease Con-  trol and Prevention in Atlanta. “We'd like to bottle it and get it to others, but we haven't figured out how to do that yet.”  The trend is striking:  In 1976, Federal surveys of thou- sands of high school seniors around the country showed that both black and white teen-agers smoked at rela- tively high rates: 28.8 percent of whites smoked one or more ciga-  rettes a day in the 30 days before the’  interviews, while 26.8 percent of black teen-agers did so.  But by 1993, only 4.4 percent of black teen-agers took up regular smoking, according to the Institute for Social Research at the Universi-  ty of Michigan, which conducts the  annual surveys for the Government. |  Among whites, the figures remains high, at 229 percent in 1993, the highest it has been since the late  1970's.  According to an article being pub- lished on Wednesday in cancer insti- tute journal, the change is not be- cause of higher cigarette prices or because the teen-agers are using other drugs, but iste to a change in attitude and social norms, said Dr. Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who conducted group discussions with two dozen white and black teen- agers in each of five cities to deter- mine what was behind the trend. The focus groups met in Los Angeies, Washington, New Orleans, Kansas           How Teoon-Agers Have Changed  Percentage of high schoo! seniors wno smoked one or more cigarettes a day in the previous 30 days.                        HISPANIC        ‘77 *79 ‘81 ‘83 ‘8S '87 ‘89 '91 "93 Source: institute for Social Research, _- Univerany of Michigan          ‘The New York Times  City, Mo., and Raleigh, N.C.  Dr. Mills wrote in the jaurnai that family and community pressures were persuading young African- Americans not to smoke. For exam- ple, there is a belief that. cigarerte makers are targeting blacks. Refus- ing tc smoke is part of the reaction. Black parents are firm in telling their children nor to smoke, and black teen-agers have aiso changed their idea of a good time, Dr. Mills said.  - “Whereas black kids will go to a party to dance and mingle, white kids definitely will go — and this is their self-reporting — to drink beer and smoke cigarettes. Black kids just don’t see that as fun.”  _ Dr. Eriksen of the disease-controi agency said: ‘We have ‘looked at many possible explanations for it. It     The shift reflects social ‘pressure, scientists say.     is not a function of school perform- ance, or dropout rates or parentai  : income.” In each of those categories,  he said, when the groups were com- pared, the rate of regular smoking  was was two to three times as high -  among white teen-agers as among black teen-agers. . “For example, among dropouts,  the whites are two to three times.  more likely to smoke,” he said.  The lower rate among blacks also.  is not explained by use of other drugs ‘instead of smoking, because black teen-agers have also decreased their use of other drugs, including mari-  juana, alcohol and cocaine, Dr. Erik-.  sen. . He explained: “Blacks seem to be  . turning off the message from ciga-  rette companies that smoking is cool. For blacks, it no longer pro- vides that function. You hear black teens saying smoking’s a white thing.”  He noted that white rock groups and performers like Brad Pitt, Wino- na Ryder and Johnny Depp, contin- ued to glamorize smoking, while biack performers did not.  “Over ail, we are very depressed about teen smoking because we have made no progress over the last 10 years,” he said. “The only bright spot is the black teens. It shows us that we shouldn't be satisfied with more than 20 percent of teens smok- ing. A significant portion of the popu- lation has already got it under 5 percent.” . :  GE6SEGSITNG  er RR TEN __label__News

A ITuman PB-PK Model for Simulating Nicotine Uptake from Transdermal Delivery and Cigarette Smoking  Speaker: Dr. J). Donald deBethizy Presentation Time: 45 minutes  Human exposure to nicotine can occur from tobacco use, ETS, diet, gum, nasal spray, or transdermal delivery. A human PBPK model for nicotine and a major nicotine metabolite, cotinine, was developed from a previously published rat PBPK model. A novel forearm compartment was used to describe the blood sampling site in humans.  The model accounted for 20% decrease in nicotine clearance during cigarette smoking. The human model predicts plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine following  intravenous injection, smoking, and transdermal delivery of nicotine. The model 7  suggests that tissue kinetics following transdermal delivery closely resemble those via steady-state intravenous infusion. The human forearm compartment overcomes some limitations when scaling a rat PBPK model to humans where the venous sampling sites are different.  This human PBPK model for nicotine will be useful for examining differences in the time course of pharmacodynamic responses to nicotine following the indicated routes of administration. __label__Report

- . PROJECT MX QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ° (MDD #86-42903)     The purpose of this report is to present findings from recent MX product qualitative research. . .  BACKGROUND:  Project MX is a tobacco-filtered cigarette developed to appeal to male, non-menthol smokers. Initial qualitative research on 14mg conventional blend products was conducted among FF smokers. This research indicated a problem with. too much impact.  As a result of this learning, R&D developed three reduced nicotine blends and two variations of the shredded tobacco filter:  o Blends  - Control-Conventional, high nicotine (A)  - Low nicotine (B) ~ Low nicotine with vanillin and chocolate in top dressing (C)  - Low nicotine with increased air dilution (H)  o Filter Variations     - All-tobacco filter ~ Combination filter: 15mm tobacco/l0mm cellulose acetate  -- Control-Cellulose acetate at mouth end (G) -- Tobacco filter at mouth end (F)  These prototypes were examined to aid R&D in determining blend, casing and top dressing direction for future quantitative testing.  METHODOLOGY:  Four focus groups were held on August 4-5, 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia. The all male groups were split on the basis of age (18-34, 35-49) and flavor grouping (FF, FFLT). All the respondents smoked 85mm, non-menthol brand styles.  Each group was initially exposed to a cigarette with the combination filter (G). Since the cellulose acetate portion was at the mouth end, this enabled us to obtain consumer perceptions of what looked to be a standard product. Smokers were then shown the tobacco filter concept (see attachment) without product. Following their comments on the concept itself and their expecta~ tions of the product, they were given a cigarette identical to the first with the exception that the tobacco portion of the combination filter was at the mouth end. This was followed by exposure to other prototypes with an all- tobacco filter. In addition, smokers were able to visually compare two colors  of the all-tobacco filter.     6800 7090S __label__Report

Philip Morris USA 22222?  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia To: Distribution Date: Dec. 6, 1994 From: Peter Martin Subject: Minutes of Meeting on NO Concentration Modification and Document Availability     On 17 November a meeting was held to develop ideas on modifying the concentration of NO in mainstream smoke. The following issues were discussed:-  1. Nitrate in tobacco as the principal source of NO in smoke. 2. General methods identified in existing patents and literature.  3. The impact of cigarette dilution on smoke component concentrations.  4, Existing patents 5. Results of a Central File search on this topic.  It was felt that discussions should be resumed once there has been an opportunity to review the  existing patents and literature. To this purpose the result of a recent search is attached to this memo.

PROJECT TITLE 3 SAVOURY  PERIOD: COVERED: : NOVEMBER 1982 ~ JANUARY 1983  WRITTEN BY  Zuber-J. (JAZ)     OBJECTIVES  Amino acid mixtures obtained by hydrolysis. of yeast (Ninomass, Learmass, etc.) are reacted with sugar (Maillard reaction) so as: to give: a flavouriing formulation.. The latter will be used on: tobacco: which is: in the form of strips, cut filler, stems  etc. in order to up-grade tobacco lacking Burley taste character.  STATUS  i. Cigarettes  The PME Leaf Department wishes to determine the degree to which cooked flavours can. reinforce the Burley taste of Burley substitutes. It was decided (1): to work with two test cigarettes having the same: blend which differs from the MLF blend in the proportion of substitute. Although  the two test. cigarettes have the same: blend, the substitute is treated differently in each case. For cigarette 1, the suk -  stitute undergoes the Burley treatment of standard MLF wnereas in  cigarette 2, it is only humidified.  MLF Cigarette 1 Cigarette 2 eee US- Burley. 19.5 13.1 % 13.1 3% Supstitute 7.5 13.9 3% 13.9 3 Burley treat- yes yes no ment of the substitute  Sample production will be started soon.  2. Maillard Reaction     We wish to reduce: the time of Maillard reaction between the yeast hydrolysates and the sugars (5 days at 909°C and 453 HO for the best flavour yet obtained (2)). As it is. known that it is possible to vary considerably the reaction rate by modifying the water content, two cooked. flavours. were  ~2- __label__Scientific

We will maintain current pricing on WINSTON $4,00/$.40 specially marked product while these promotional supplies last. Contact your cigarette supplier for availability and additional information. By maintaining your inventories on WINSTON $4.00/$.40 specially marked product and other specially marked . product, you can continue to offer to your.customers a low price on these brands.  ConAsEmMehs” Our naw pricing effectively creates two price tiers for our products, premium and discount. All brand styles within each pricing tier (reqular/King/ 100/120) will be priced the same. We suggest that you consult with your cigarette supplier or chain headquarters for complete detalls of price changes that may have resulted from our announcement.  _ {tis recommended that you sell through on-hand higher priced inventories prior to rolling back your retail prices to consumers, We also suggest you reset your price for all brand styles in the premium and discount ‘categories at one time, thereby eliminating confusion for both stora personnel and customers. Instead of trying to target a certain date, our objective Is that you have maximum flexibility In resetting your prices as” most appropriate for you based upon your store's inventory situation.  We will not offer a retall participation/inventory protection program. Each retailer Is In the best position to tailor its pricing strategies to fit its particular Inventory levels, and It would be extremely difficult for us to audit the Inventory of over 300,000 retali outlets and offer a fair reconciliation of on-hand Inventory.  During the week of August 2, 1993, you will receive rallback point-of-sale materials to use in communicating your new lower prices to your customers.

fo  Yr Gul |  CTR Grant 3966 Principal Investigator: Thomas Smithgall  Title: Regulation of ras signaling by the c-fes proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase  Critique: The applicant has shown that c-fes, which is proposed to be linked to GM-CSF, interleukin 3 and erythropoietin receptor signaling pathways has been shown to cause myeloid cell differentiation and to block GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation. The applicant proposes that the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase c-fes exerts its antigrowth and differentiating effects by opposing the major growth pathway involving activated ras. The applicant has clearly identified a very important question, because it is clear that tyrosine kinases are involved in differentiation as well as in proliferation. The strengths of this proposal are several: Firstly, the importance of the question addressed; secondly, the extensive background work carried out by the principal investigator, both in published work from his postdoctoral fellowship and in publications and preliminary data obtained as an independent investigator, thirdly, the use of straightforward, readily interpretable assays focusing on the effect of c-fes on GAP activity; and fourthly, broader considerations of the effects of c- fes involving other components of the mitogenic signaling cascades such as fos, shc, and vav.  The Principal Investigator received his Ph.D. in 1986 in pharmacology from the University of Pennsylvania where he studied steroid metabolizing enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism. His postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health began his work on tyrosine kinases and specifically c-fes, its biological activity and interaction with GAP. He has a very strong publication record with important studies published in highly refereed and quality journals, such as Biochemistry and The Journal of Biological Chemistry. He became an Assistant Professor at the Eppley Institute in 1991. He presently has National Institutes of Health and American Cancer Society support, the latter for salary. Budget should be reduced to a bingle.  Resume; This is an excellent proposal by a young assistant professor to study the molecular mechanisms through which the tyrosine kinase c-fes induces cell differentiation. The excellent publication record, the importance of the question and the focused nature of the studies make this an outstanding proposal. In this application, as in several others reviewed, the applicant requests funds for a specific project that is conceptually related to and uses the same tools as that of an NIH grant that is on-going. I would suggest discussion of the generic problem of individuals submitting multiple grants to study a single question with one grant being sent in for each small aspect of the general question and hypothesis, i.e., none of these represent distinct lines of inquiry. Recommend approval at a scientific priority of 1.2.     40009604 __label__Scientific

BURR, ELLIE'S NewsExpressf     Page 1 of 2 (SSFLOK16)  By GLENN SINGER BUSINESS WAITER  ROCKVILLE, Md. — Let's face it. Nisn’t easy to quit smoking.  Mast of us know people who have tried smoking cessation clas- ses, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, the drug Zyban and even hypnosis —and then went back ta their pack-a-day habit.  Now, scientists at Nabi, a Boca Raton-based biopharmaceutical company, are working on a new  approach.  and technical support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, they are devel- oping a vac- cine to prevent nicetine from reaching the brain and trig- gering chemi- cal reactions that cause addiction.  “You can try to quit smoking, but the addiction is always there. The desire to smoke hardly ever goes away,” said Robert Naso, a Nabi se- lor vice president who oversees product development at company laboratories in Maryland.  Nabi, which previously special- ized in collecting and providing plasma to other pharmaceutical manufacturers, now focuses its re- search and development efforts on creating and marketing drugs that prevent and treat infectious and au- to-immune diseases.  The company has several clini-     Naso  With financial’  Sun May 28, 2000 Appears On Page 1F Circulation: 391,063  , Vaccine  maker targets  EDT     smokers  cal trials under way in these areas, and has four pharmaceutical prod- ucts on the market. Sales of phar- maceutical and antibody products generated $234 million in 1999 for Nabi, which has 1,750 employees.  ‘Tthad $3.3 million in net income  last year. Its stock has been trading in the $5-6 range recently and closed on Friday at $4.88.  The idea to create an anti-smok- ing vaccine came, in part, from the development ofan unrelated vac- cine for staphylococcus infections that uses similar technology.  The key to getting someone to stop smoking is to find a way to sti- fle the desire, Nabi scientists be- lieve they can accomplish that with an injectable vaccine that not only prevents nicotine molecules from passirig from the bloodstream inta  - the brain, but also prompts the im-  Ml MEDICINE continues on 10F  mune systern to create antibodies that eliminate nicotine from the body.  “It’s a fascinating concept — novel and unique," said Frank Voc- ct, director of the division of treat- ment, research and development for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “The methods we have used to date don’t really work that well. This could be a real advancement.”  The institute announced in April that it had awarded Nabi a four- year grant to conduct further tests on animals, particularly those re- laled to safety, and then conduct human trials. The first year’s por- fion, $776,000, will be released Sept. 30.  if human irials are successtui and the vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration Nic-VAX, as itis called, could be available by 2005, Naso said, The company is seeking a partner to help pay development costs thai could run inte the tens of millions The partner also is needed to heip sell the product in the United Siates, and, possibly, around the warld.  “We think there’s a tremendous potential market for the vaccine worldwide,” Naso said. “Cleariy, this would be a high-valued prod- uct, but it’s far too early to talk about price.”  The scope of the potential niar- ket is huge.  More than 25 percent of a Americans, or about 50 milliun               people, smoke cigarettes. Add i: this an estimated 6 million teen-ap- ers and more than 100,000 childre:. under age 13, according to povern- ment figures. ,  About 80 percent of smakers ex- press a desire to quit, while 26 pur cent actually try. Fewer than 5 per- cent of those who make the attempt succeed for six months or longer. according to the American Psychi- atric Assaciation.  Nabi scientists and their collaba- rators in Minneapolis and Housten are growing excited about the po- ject, now that efficacy testing im mice, rats, rabbits and goats fas shown the vaccine blocks nicotine from entering the brain.  “We are having discussions with the Food and Drug Administrator     Sun-Sentinel __label__News

The Tobacco Institute . June 16, 1995  1995 STATE UPDATE & OUTLOOK TOBACCO LEGISLATION, REGULATION & BALLOT MEASURES  OVERVIEW  To date, 49 state legislatures have convened their 1995 sessions. Kentucky, the only state not scheduled to have a regular session this year, has already held a special session on taxes. Lawmakers in 33 states have adjourned their regular sessions, and an additional six states are expected to adjoum by the end of June. Ilinois and Michigan lawmakers have completed their regular session business  and have recessed for the summer, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are expected to do the same by the end of this month.  TAXES     Despite opposition efforts, legislators in South Dakota passed the first tobacco tax increase in 1995. The bill, signed by Governor Janklow on March 16, adds 10 cents to the current 23-cent cigarette excise tax, imposes a new 10% tax on other tobacco products, and establishes the state legislature as exclusive regulator of matters relating to the use of tobacco products. A second tax increase was signed into law on April 12 by Vermont Governor Dean. Included in the funding for indigent health care were a 24-cent cigarette tax hike and 21% increase in the OTP tax rate.  An Oregon tax bill awaits Governor Kitzhaber’s approval. The bill would extend the sunset date for 10 cents of the current 38-cent cigarette excise tax until January 1, 1998; the tax was scheduled to be reduced this year. Other attempts to raise the cigarette tax in Oregon failed this year. In Wisconsin, a group of legislators requested a 50-cent hike in the cigarette excise tax; however, the Joint Finance Committee reported its budget without any tobacco taxes. Wisconsin legislators may still introduce a  separate bill to recover the state’s “smoking-related” expenditures or attempt to amend the budget. Eight other states are considering cigarette tax increases.  Thus far this year, cigarette tax increases have been defeated in 14 states, including a 25.1-cent hike in Florida, 40-cent hike in Hawaii and 18-cent increase in Montana. Lawmakers in Minnesota rejected seven bills to increase tobacco taxes and seven more attempts to amend the House omnibus tax bill. Also, attempts in Washington to repeal the 26-cent cigarette tax increase, scheduled to be implemented over the next two years, were unsuccessful.  9209 96ETS __label__Report

He does not believe cigarettes coded 854A (new extremely high porosity paper) will be ready this week.  Therefore, we plan to ship the cigarettes to U. S. Testing for the T.P.M., nicotine and total R.T.D. analysis as soon as code 872F arrives at the Center. One pack from each of the ten cartons will be sent to U. S. Testing.  Cigarettes for exit temperature, phenol, furfural, humectant and moisture in filter will be taken from the same 10 carton sample. Where the data is not available, analysis will be carried out at the Research Center. Experimental work will start immediately. It is estimated that all the analyses  “except phenols will be completed by November 9 providing no unforseen delays arise.  hi  S   SOTL9ZTOOT x  ra __label__Memo

Yet, it is not known tc what extent recorded weight gain in those who give up cigarette smoking is g-tually caused by aging.

Since there appears to be a trend toward increasing body weight in male adylts below the age of 45, this raises the question as to whether the weight gained by former amokers is attributable to smoking cessation or is an effect of aging.  Unfortunately many of the studies that have examined the relationship of smoking cessation to weight gain have foeused on cross-sectionaldata."" An analysis based on longitudinal data, the Comatock and Stone study," confounds the problem by using 8 re- stricted age range (40 to 60 years) and by not having controlled for the fact that men (undifferentiated for amoking habita) below the age of 45 years tend to gain weight as they get older.

Response to Comments Offered by Reviewer #2 in Connection with "Estimation of the Effect of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on the Air Quality Within Aircraft Cabins"  The following paragraphs respond to comments offered by Reviewer #2 in connection with Manuscript Number ES8601745.  Comment #1.  Reviewer #2 writes in the first paragraph that the data [contained in our report] could introduce some solid and scientific numbers into an otherwise emotional and political public issue. In the second paragraph the reviewer adds that the authors seemed to be more concerned with  defending the accuracy and integrity of the analytical procedures than with the conclusions that can be drawn from the work.  Response.  We agree with the reviewer’s comment regarding the emotional and political aspects of the issue we investigated. We also agree with the comment dealing with the greater concern indicated for defending our analytical procedures. In preparing the manuscript, we anticipated the possibility of emotionalism and politics affecting review, and consequently we took great effort to ensure that our procedures were  described as completely as practical within the constraints of maintaining brevity. .  Comment #2.  The reviewer apparently suggests that the manuscript discuss our  results in view of health standards or relevant toxicological information.  Response.  While we are aware of the TLV for nicotine, we believe that use of this figure for comparative purposes is inappropriate and potentially misleading owing to its specific applicability for assessing exposure to nicotine (exclusive of ETS) in industrial settings. To our knowledge, the literature is devoid of information relating to either toxicological or health aspects specific to nicotine at the levels we measured. Similarly, information relative to ETS (at levels which may be estimated from our results) exists only in the form of epidemiological studies, the results of which are ambiguous and consequently highly controversial. We believe that science is best served by discussing our results only in the context of estimated exposures. It is our hope that  the results we report will prove useful to researchers investigating the relation between exposure and dose.  we  ue  “Cababey:  nGb2 629CS __label__Report

Sixteen are current grantees. Nine are new recipients. Among the possible projects, the organizations will be promoting stricter local tobacco retailing regulations, particularly tobacco  advertising rules. One of the group's goal is to lower Minnesota's smoking rate to under 15 percent by 2000.  Yarmouth, MA--The chamber and restaurant leaders met yesterday and decided to come up with an alternative proposal to a complete ban which would involve the 6-foot rule, barriers and ventilation systems. The word is a complete ban is on the minds of the board of health. On 8/25, there will be  a big demonstration by seven filtration companies.

ANETHOLE  TOXICITY PROFILE  Anethole (B71) is a naturally occurring compound found in oils of aniseed, star-anise, fennel and leaves of Clausena anisata (Opdyke, 1973).  REGULATORY STATUS  FEMA GRAS  FDA GRAS  HUNTER LIST (Not to exceed 0.15% in cigarette, cigar or hand- rolling tobacco; and 0.5% in pipe tobacco)  JECFA (ADI 0 - 0.6 mg/kg for man)  COUNCIL OF EUROPE (ADI 1.5 mg/kg trans-anethole)  METABOLISM .  Human studies indicate that anethole is excreted largely in the urine (Caldwell and Sutton, 1988, Le Bourhis, 1973, and Sangster et al., 1987). A 500 mg oral dose was excreted as hydroxybenzoic acid (5%) and methoxybenzoic acid (52%), while a 1 g oral dose did not yield detectable blood levels of anethole (Le Bourhis, 1973). A major portion of a 1 mg dose administered to two human subjects was excreted in the urine as 4-methoxyhippuric acid (Sangster et al., 1987).  In another study, human volunteers given an oral dose range of 1 - 250 mg (~0.01 - 5 mg/kg) trans-anethole exhibited metabolic patterns similar to those seen in high-dose rodent studies. 4-Methoxyhippuric acid was the major metabolite and the majority of the dose was eliminated within 8 hours (Caldwell and Sutton, 1988). In mice and rats, [methoxy-**C] anethole is extensively metabolized by o-demethylation and oxidative transformation of the three-carbon side chain, yielding a variety of products (Sangster et al., 1984a).  Reed and Caldwell (1992) report that trans-Anethole exhibited a modest enzyme inducing effect in female Charles River SD-CD rats following administration of either 300 mg/kg/day trans-anethole for 7 days or 0%, 0.25%, and 1.0% in diet for 21 days. Appropriate vehicle and positive controls were included for both assays. Anethole did not appear to be a potent, broad-spectrum inducer of hepatic enzyme activity in a screening study in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice (unpubl).  E6ESLILS __label__Scientific

Jameson, Ph.D. : National Institutes of Health |  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences P.O. Box 12233  Research Triangle Park, NC 27709  Re: Ninth Report on Carcinogens,/ MD EC-14 Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)  Dear Dr. Jameson:  I understand that the National Toxicology Program is accepting comments for use in its consideration of a petition to list environmental tobacco smoke (“ETS”) as a “known human carcinogen” or as being “reasonably anticipated to be a known human carcinogen.” Scientists at R. J. Reynolds are gathering pertinent information that we believe will assist NIP in its determination. That information will be forwarded to you shortly by them.  In the meantime, as you may know, a! federal district court recently vacated the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency’s Report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that sought to classify ETS as a known human carcinogen. I enclose a copy of the court’s opinion for your review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS.  The opinion begins by discussing the procedures Congress had established for EPA to follow in its research program on indoor air quality. The court concluded that EPA fell short of complying with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether, “aside from procedural defects” (page 38),| EPA conducted the risk assessment in accordance with the Radon Research. Act... The‘core scientific requirements of the Radon Research Act are  identified as “[g]athering all relevant information, researching, and disseminating findings”  (page 90) arid providing “clear, objective information about indoor air quality” (page 91). The ~ TS  court found that EPA’s goal was to name E objective scientific review.  S a Group A carcinogen, rather than to conduct an  “We work for smokers.”        GEG TIT2S __label__Letter

Suffredin, Jr. Simon & Spitalli  55 West Wacker Drive  Suite 702  Chicago, IL 60601  Dear Mr. Suffredin;  Everyone is aware that Governor Thompson has proposed a cigarette excise tax increase. On Friday, April 7, 1989, Senator James "Pate" Philip, Minority Leader of the Illinois Senate, introduced SB-1113 for the 18 cent cigarette excise tax increase and the bill was referred to the Revenue Committee on Thursday, April 13, 1989. If passed, this bill would have a major impact on many sectors of the Illinois economy as well as our industry.  I invite you to evaluate this tax bill with Kurt L. Malmgren, Senior Vice President of The Tobacco Institute at a very important meeting being held on Monday, April 24, 1989 from 10:30 am to  12:30pm at the O'Hare Hilton, International Airport, Chicago, IL - PH: 312-686-8000.

DBL APR251988_RESD  —  April i8 ~ April 22, 1988  To: Mr. B. M. Wagner  ware  SUBJECT: Project URP Weekly Status  Central Laboratory Services representatives attended VRP status meetings 4/19 & 4/20. The meetings are summarized as follows:  .  ars .  . Cigarette Paper R&D will address the need for a specification on Sodiun Acetate in VRP paper. Sodium Acetate is found in VRP Paper as a result of the bleaching process.  The presence of Sodium Acetate causes a discrepancy between the method Ecusta uses for Potassium Acetate and the method RJR GA and RJR R&D use. Ecusta's method for detection of Potassium Acetate reports both Potassium and Sodium Acetate  - as Potassium Acetate. GA is able to to test for and report Potassium Acetate, Sodium Acetate or Total Acetate. The specifications as currently written addresses only Potassium Acetate levels.  The April 12th shipment of VRP paper contained nq Potassium Acetate but had signifigant amounts of Sodium Acetate.  Visible Sidestream Apparatus/Measurenment The Visible Sidestream Apparatus is to be delivered to QA 4/21. Operator training and correlation testing will begin as soon as the apparatus is operational. .  R&D is to provide written test methods to QA prior to analysis of test market product.  The test market product will be jointly tested by R&D and GA. Both the 85 and 100 mm brand styles will be split, with each lab testing half of the samples.  Brand R&D has requested QA assistance in measuring visible sidestream smoke on prototypes. QA will provide assistance to R&D as provided on other analytical methods, i.e. QA will  assist R&D with overflow prototype testing, provided the additional analyses will not put OA in an overtime  situation.

Small-biz owners fume over Council's ad ban  By Bop LirF Dally News Start Water  Small-business owners yes-  rday urged the City Council to reject a Proposed ban on cigaret ads near city schools and gathering places for kids, arguing that the Sweeping crackdown could snuff out their profits,  Advertising industry offi- cials also spoke out against the law Proposed by Couneil Speaker Peter Vallone (D- Queens) and Council Minority leader Tom Ognibene (R- Queens).  The bill, tougher than a pro-  3 posed federal crackdown on z cigaret ads, would ban Joe Ss el and other tobacco ads thin 1,000 feet of 4 school,  Up to $30 million a year in pro- * motional revenue that goes to gas and groceries, The  before “unreasonably burden. ing these 40,000 cigaret-sett- ing retailers.”  The American Advertising Federation warned that the bill violates constitutional guarantees protecting “truth. ful commercial speech.”  “Banning tobacco advertis- ing will do nothing to address the probiems of underage smoking,” federation officials  ‘said. “It sends an unmistak-  able message that New York City, the home of Madison Ay- enue, is hostile to advertis- ing.”  Vallone was unmoved by the lobbying. “We believe the Placement of tobacco adver- tisements close to Where kids congregate is a prime cause of the surge in Youth smoking,” he said.

DE 20006 President 202/457-4800 © 800/424-9876  July 17, 1987 ny,  MEMORANDUM     TO: Executive Committee  FR: Samuel D. Chilcote, ie. So  Today the Senate Finance Committee conducted its third and final day of hearings on revenue options. The hearing was chaired for most of the time by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) ; Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) attended for just a short period of time. Other Senators in attendance included Thomas Daschle (D-SD), Donald Riegle (D-MI), Daniel Moynihan (D-NY), Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and John Chafee (R-RI). The witness list and selected testimony are attached.     Highlights include:  ° Rudy Oswald, Director, Economic Research Department, AFL-CIO, opposed any new or expanded sales, excise, or other consumption taxes. "It is our strong belief that any new revenues be raised on the basis of ability to pay," Oswald said, adding, "regressive taxes are contrary to the goal of tax justice and intent of Congress in enacting the 1986 reforms." Oswald encouraged the Committee "to focus its attention on the individual and corporate income tax and the  estate and gift tax."  oO Paul Huard, Vice President, Taxation and Fiscal Policy, National Association of Manufacturers, opposed any changes to individual or corporate taxes or selectively imposed excise taxes. "We oppose without exception any change that would increase federal revenues derived from selectively-imposed excise taxes," he said. Huard characterized excise taxes as "undeniably regressive." He added, "If Congress is determined to raise additional federal tax revenues, it should only be done by imposing a consumption-type tax at a uniform rate on the broadest possible base of taxable goods  and services."

Crtthnd Guill COMPANY  MEMORANDUM:  April §, 11993  TO: L. H. Gains FROM: Cc. §. Williard  SUBJECT: Determination of Organic Aldehyde Delivery for An Experimental Smokable Article Submitted by D. R. Smart. (PROJECT B. 491, SA)  Introduction  Samples of a prototype: smokable article (hereinafter called “experimental. cigarettes") were submitted by D. R. Smart for determinatiion of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as. a control.  Experimental  Both. experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in  the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity conditions. for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 9 puffs of each cigarette were collected under standard conditions. using a 35. mL puff volume, 2 seconds in duration, at one minute intervals, then a clearing; puff was. taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 125 mL Dreschel bottle comtaining 50 mL of trapping reagent. The trapping reagent. contained 200 mL of 0.125% dinitrophenyl- hydrazine. (DNPH) in acetonitrile, 20 mL of 1.N perchloric acid, diluted to 500 mL with acetonitrile. After smoking, the DNPH- smoke solution was neutralized with 2 mL of 1 N triethylamine.  The DNPH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC-UV analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M HPLC was equipped with Novapak. (C18) column 3.9: x 150 mm, with a 5 fim particle size. The mobile phase was acettonitrile, water, tetrahydrofuran (60:30:10) with a flow rate off 1 mL/min. An injection volume: of 10 PL was: used. Following each analysis, the column was washed with. acetonitrile at. 2 mL/min for 30: minutes.  Results  The aldehyde deliveries for the experimental cigarettes verses the Kent III’ control cigarettes are reported in Table 1. The aldehyde deliveries were substantially less for the experimental cigarettes.  Ce8S2eLE __label__Memo
(eT 2 pp: TL -gerrekd docume Tj Last 4 pp: Aout LD  SMOKING IN SWEDEN  o Per capita adult (> 15 yrs. old) cigarette consumption increased from 1,726 units in 1977 to 1,781 units in 1981 -- averaging 0.6  percent a year, but variable.  Overall sales of cigarettes in Sweden declined for only one year in this 1977-8L interval, and increased for all other years to 1982.  From 1977 to 1980, Sweden's population increased by only 0.7 percent, but cigarette sales during this period increased by 4.87 percent (from  11.357 billion cigarettes to 11.91 billion).     o Per capita adult cigarette consumption for the period 1975 to 1981 was strongly correlated with sales, with regard to statistical variability, but Swedish population increase was not significantly  related to sales variations.  An article of May 1982 in the Swedish Journal Nordisk Medecin, Vol. 97, pp 134-136, indicated that total tobacco consumption in Sweden is  remarkably stable. Among the conclusions were the facts that some heavy to moderate male smokers have increased use of snuff; there was an increase in smoking quantities among women; the percentage of male  smokers declined moderately but steadily.  Svenska Tobaks AB information dept. reported data [in 1982] on which these trends are based. They also report that 4 percent of the  population roll their own, and these cigarette smokers may increase the actual number of cigarette smokers in Sweden when they are added  to those who smoke manufactured cigarettes (the latter 33 percent of all adults).

The cigarettes used were:  DODAT Dual-wrapped with 45 g/M’ outer paper having 35% CaCo,, {#9569} 0.4% NH,H,PO,, 0.3% NaCMC, and 5% K,succinate, and. inner paper with 18 g/M? basis weight, 3% CaCO, and  0.6% citrate  D9DAV Single wrapped with high basis weight paper, 68 g/m’, (#9571) with 35% Caco, and 10% KH,PO,  Marlboro Lights 100's as control  For all three cigazette sample. sets, the burning event took place as we had seen before, with a period of char followed by a burn, The burn seemed to move around the circumference of the cigarette in one direction or the other, sometimes changing direction while on the visible side. Visual observation of two cigarettes, placed in the chamber so that both sides could be seen, showed the burn proceeding on one side and then the other alternately in the same direction. This suggested that the burn did, indeed, circle around the full circumference in whichever direction it was moving.  The smoke from the Marlboro cigarette was visible in close proximity. to the rod, and on the images from these tapes the smoke was seen moving upward along the front side of the rod, a few millimeters ahead of the char line (Figure 1). All of the cigarettes in the test showed an area where smoke emanates from the underside of the rod a few millimeters ahead of the char (Figures 1 to 4), but the video image of the low sidestream cigarettes did not always include a plume above the rod (Figure 2). During the taping, a plume of smoke could always be seen: above these cigarettes by visual inspection. Where the video image shows no plume, the smoke. had coalesced to form the plume at a point above and outside of the imaging area of the camera. The visible smoke from the low sidestream cigarettes was considerably less than that produced by the Marlboro cigarettes.  The cigarettes with the single wrapper of heavy-weight paper showed bursts of smoke coming from the rows of perforations along the unburnt portion of the rod, with sometimes startling: visual displays (Figures 3 & 4). Depending on the orientation of the holes with respect to the camera, there was a series of small plumes sometimes from the underside, sometimes from the top, and occasionally they were visible on the front surface of the rod.  9092T9S202% __label__Memo

Banke pi ”  oate._Sept. 22, 1978     SuBect Menthol And Triacetin Loss From Arctic Lights Filter Rods ———  SUMMARY:     Louisville Branch Testing Department has conducted four separate tests to determine the rates of menthol and triacetin toss from Aretic Lights filter rods under various storage conditions. Analyses have bean conducted by both R&D and Branch Technical Services. The results of these tescs indicate no significant © loss of menthol or triacetin regardless of storage conditions.  A recommendation is presented that Arctic. Lights filter. rods he handled and stored using normal procedures with. uc special pro- tective maasures being taken to control menthol loss.  INTRODUCTION  During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was rec- ™ ognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent  loss of menthol from filter rods. Dr. Heitkamp obtatned samples  from two trays of filter rods cver/a 5 day period and reported  a substantial loss. of menthol (Dr. N. D. Heitkamp to D. V. Cantrell, April 17, 1978). Dr. Heitkamp's report indicated only a very  slight loss of triacetin. . .  Two possible methods were devised for preventing. menthol loss from Arctic Lights filter rods, The first was a specially con~ structed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container. The second method was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and bottom, Doors were Fitted ta the trolley with metal frames and felt gaskets.     A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods of holding Arctic Lights filter roda.  ssesososs  get 2B  wg : yan __label__Memo

INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM  SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights DATE: August 4, 1987 Flavor Technology TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: Brian Lawrence 6) RVD. Flavor Support for SALEM . ~~  Products, in the SALEM KS and SALEM Light 85 styles, were made by Brand R&D using cavity filters containing various levels of menthol laden polymer beads. At their request, menthol formulations of cut filler application were designed to simulate the same menthol deliveries as the above prototypes. Calculations for these topdressings were based on the analyses obtained from the menthol content in the tobacco and the polymer beads. An aging study will be conducted by Brand R&D on the comparison of these two menthol products: mentholated beads in filter versus mentholated cut filler. It was also recommended to Brand R&D that a comparison of the puff-by-puff smoke menthol profiles is essential information if a true delivery of menthol against  time basis is to be understood.       7  Brian Lawrence     /mpm Xc: Applied R&D Managers  SET’ 9P90S __label__Letter

Acid consumption (2) ©  Trials of the pilot plant showed different results concerning the acid consumption in the NINO-process than those we have found in the laboratory. We therefore determine these values  again at different pH-values and initial phosphate concentrations. We could confirm the consumption of 31 g phosphoric acid (35 %) per liter of denitrated extract ata PH of 4.0.

In this trial we could show that we need at least 3 days to reach true steady-state conditions.  It however has to be mentioned that the denitration is also ® working without having a true steady-state. We try now to have  analogous trials done in the laboratory and pilot plant fermenters  Cellulase (4)  The production of cellulase by Trichoderma viride DSM 769 was further tested.

ct oe ino an ete pt at ST :  industry to promote research on the effects of modified products on human health. A cheritable trust. the Tobacco Products Research Trust, was set up to administer the  to difterentiate between effects of different tvpes of products. in wew of difficulties in establishing smoking histories adequatety in observational studies. and of the risk of bias when smokers switch to lower tar products as a result of developing symptoms. Thus the “core” study at St. Thomas's was developed on that basis. and delays in embarking on the research programme as a whole were due lergety to the need to approach this large-scale high-cost study very carefully, with the introduction of an additional “pre-pilot™ stage before the optimum design could be settied. and there were & number of unforeseen problems that had to be overcome. |  The tar reduction component of the studies at St. Bartholomew's, and the tar retention work at Harwell also involve intervention. but thére are fundamental difficulnes in extending this theorencaity desirable approach to the whole field of the T  actrvines. Not only are costs per subject high. but ethical considerations de the intervention spproach in respect of some types of study (such as those concerned with effects in pregnancy). and it clearly cannot be used to examine slowty-developing Conditions over periods of many years. Hence the Committees has approved several other epidemiqiogcial studies. mainty in the cardio-vascular field, thet are of Observational type. A need has aiso been seen for a number of experimental studies. to  -beern more of the croperties and behaviour of the smoke from modified products. In  this, and in respect of other features, links have been established between a number of the studies funded by the Trust. The same representative cigarettes are. for example, included in the large epidemiological study (St. Thomas's), the human smoking - experimental work (Harwell) and the mutagenicity studies st Swansea. Information on enstytical procedures is exchanged. and in some cases samples are cross-checked by Gitferent methods between the various centres. or sent to a central laboratory for _ . assessment.  Provision has aiso been made to poo! data from all the prospective mortality studies that the investigators are involved in, whether or not the basic funding is from the Trust. In these and other ways the Commnttee has attempted to develop an integrated programme. winch in the past year has been extended. following up some of the earlier pelot work and filling some gaps thst remasned on the scope of Ms actit.o1 ft & hoped that some of the more recent expermental studies funded will complement the esrker enetomiunlnne al em Aee     EL8O Lz8es __label__Report

Qualitatively, Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste" and to be "less harsh". A large percentage of the Marlboro Lights smokers preferred their own brand because it was milder.

(B&W: PROTECTED BY MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION PROTECTIVE ORDER  “ BROWN & WELLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT  FILE NOTE  SUBJECT: PAPER RECON FROM MARLBORO KS AND MARLBORO MENTHOL LIGHTS 100'S/451  AUTHOR: E. D. Alford P DATE: November 20, 1987  cc; M. L. Reynolds, T. F. Riehl, C. N. Kounnas, A. MeMurtrie, D. V. Cantrell, J. o. Lauterbach,-J. F. Nall, W. H. Deines, R. R. Johnson, E. F. Litzinger, D. A. Colby, W. R. Conway, R. A, Marshall  ATION  SUMMARY  ‘The paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s were found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS contained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-ammonia products. The Marlboro Menthol Lights 100's paper recon did not contain phosphate in excess of the level typically found in PJS where no DAP was added. Therefore, the levels of the sugar-asmonia Progucts were much lower (80-852) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s.  2 ~ Y < = S        Tt has not been proven, but the furnish for the two paper recon are also thought to be different. The furnish for the paper recon found in Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed towarg burley while, the furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s was thought to be skewed toward Elue-cured furnish.  A comparison of the paper and dark recons from Marlboro KU were also made. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the sugar-amponia reaction products found in the dark recon and in about the eame quantities. The major differences were found in the wlatile alkyl pyrazines region of the P&T profiles.  ‘ONFIDENTIAL MINNESOT,  €  e > INTRODUCTION  Bob Jobnaon bad isolated the paper recon from Marlboro KS and Marlboro  Wenthol Lights 100's. These materials, along with the dark recon from 8 Marlboro KS, were examined by purge-and-trap (P&T) and direct  silylation (DS) GC-MS. The combination of both of these analyses  showed the volatiles from the alkylpyrazines to deoxyfructosazine and » fructosazines, Data from both of the analyses were used to reach the conclusions drawn in this file note.  812 76066 __label__Report

August 12, 1987 a.  f *  TO: TT. J. McCabe  RE: Marlboro Media Plan  Attached is an excellent compilation of Marlboro's 1986 media plan and key learning/conclusions relative to this formidable competitor's media strategies/tactics, The information was compiled and analyzed by Gabe Gabriel and is illustrated in a standard RJR plan deck format.  As Gabe concludes, Marlboro's media activity is extraordinarily broad and extensive - a mass media schedule befitting a dominant~share brand with appeal transcending focused demographic parameters.  Importantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address Marlboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous  presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against smokers likely to switch out of the franchise,  This strategy is similar to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR primarily concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity segments, Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise.  Opportunity = Convert Base Opportunity = Maintain Opportunity = vonvert — YPP y  Marlboro Franchise ———~—------> _ Older Adult Smokers Younger Adult ——-~—~--> RJR Brands Franchise Smokers  With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning, for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.  Let us know if you would Jike to discuss.  Patti Ittermann PRI seje  Attachment  weer W. A. Gabriel  z2see SE40S __label__Letter

Hudnall Christopher, Jr. Executive Vice President  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102  Dear Hudnall: Wukh  The Monograph on the new cigarette was here on my desk when I returned to New York, and I really have enjoyed reading this. Needless to say, I did not absorb every nuance, but the overall impact of the document is very positive.  First of all, I am impressed with the meticulous nature of your studies and the exemplary way in which they are presented. Obviously your peer review committee felt the same  way.  Next, the product of itself is impressive. I was astonished when I saw it "in action" at our meeting with you, and now the analysis of the concept and the construction is equally impressive.  Finally, you have done a very good thing in producing this document. It should help the new product gain public as well as scientific acceptance. There would seem to be little doubt that you are on the right track.  When I have absorbed a little more from the volune, I will pass it around the office so that all can see this.  I am enclosing a summary of the neuroendocrine effects  of nicotine, prepared by Dr. Don Ford of our staff here at CTR.  Don is a neuroanatomist, who has a long-standing interest in nicotine effects, and he has prepared an excellent summary which might be of interest to Bob DiMarco or some of the members of his staff.  Thanks for the welcome on our recent visit and thanks for letting me see the book.  Sincerely, S Minamata as Om = o eye games F.

As I have said to you my outlook of life is now different. May I please request an extension without further funding of our grant entitled “Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human Lung Disease" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Harefield Hospital, and Mr. John Wallwork from Papworth Hospital, both groups of which are involved in heart lung transplants.  We have done sufficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their immunocytochemical localisation in tissue sections. These include, tn vitro autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding sites and Tn situ hybridisation/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike earlier days when availability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we would very much like to «rite up an exciting extension grant application to the best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new field of investigative pathology.     I very much hope this will not cause too much inconvenience to the Council for Tobacco Research and I look forward to hearing from you.  Best personal regards,  @ = sutia w. Potak, vse mp FRCPath.

NOTEBOOK  Qua     DAY BULLETIN  ing record  in jeopardy today  By Louls Brewster Staff Writer  FONTANA — Ifthe rain Holds offtoday, chances are the qualify- ing record for the NASCAR Crafts- man Truck Series will fall at Cali- fornia Speedway.  Seven drivers unofficially bet- tered. the existing mark Thursday afternoon in a practice session; led by Kurt Busch in a Ford. His run of 177848 mph in 40.484 seconds topped the 173.561 mph, 41.484 lap of Andy Houston last:year that won the pole.  Houston, who will move into the NASCAR Winston Cup Series along with Busch next year, was second fastest. He. pushed his Chevrolet around the track in 41.045 seconds at 175.417 mph:  Others. who went faster than Houston’s record were Dennis Set- zer and-David Starr, the fastest of the Dodges, and the Fords driven by Mike Wallace, Greg Biffle and  _ Rick Crawford.  “Our strategy is to finish second in points,” said Busch, who's bat- thing for the spot along with Hous- ton and Wallace. “We are planning to stay as close to the front as we can and put a conservative setup on it where we can be comfortable in the draft.  “Then we will just work on hang: ing oat with the No. 60 (Houston) and No. 2. (Wallace) trucks.”,  Houston said his’ team made a mock run at the pole.  “The truck is running pretty well,” said Houston, who's won the last two NCTS poles at Fontana. “I think we have a real good shot at  trying to sit on the pole. This being  my last truck race, it would be good  _to goouta winner.” .  ORIVER INJURED: Rick Ware hit the “wail in tum two. during practice and. was transported to Loma Linda Uniwersity' Med- gai Center after treatment in the infield fa- city.  The Sportsman Racing Products owner driver, whe posted a fast time of 44.330 sec- onds and 162.418 mph, was to be held overnight for observation and additional tests.

Dr. Deskin met with Mr. Don Murray and Mr. Elmer Marsh of Westvaco to define the information required for an assessment of potential product effects due to contact with tobacco. Most of this information  must be supplied by the synthesizers who are major chemical companies.  The Eastman Kodak representatives presented a séminar on a new filter additive which is Supposed to reduce the tar to  nicotine ratio. The additive is an unsaturated fatty acid which is added to the filter.  Product Contamination - R&D will analyze contaminated tobacco for titanium. Before insurance claims can be processed,  quantitative data must be gathered which determines the contamination level. The tobacco is currently being held ina bonded warehouse. The value of the tobacco is approximately 1.2 million dollars of both finished cigarettes and unprocessed tobacco. The improper type of paint was used which contained titanium dioxide. The type recommended by RJRT engineers was not used by the contractor.

(CTR), is pleased to award you a renewal grant in the amount of $80,000, including indirect costs, for the period from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 for the proposed study: “Regulation of Cell Stress Signaling by a New Antioxidant Protein." It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional authorities. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with submissions to other agencies. If the latter result in awards, we should be notified promptly so that we can negotiate an appropriate adjustment of our award.  The award is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1997, even though we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that date. Therefore, if by May 31, 1997, you submit to us a formal non-competing renewal application, including a report of your progress, your request will receive consideration.  Please review the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for Grantees." Please fill in the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me. Contact Drs. Harmon McAllister or George Hashim of our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed about the progress of your study.  The enclosed statement of “Financial Requirements” indicates that the Council recovers unexpended annual balances over $1,000 and that year end deficits cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to receive timely financial statements from your grants office will stop further payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this will obviate any possible misunderstandings.  Sincerely, y ee  James F.

PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017     TO: Distribution pate: August 25, 1989  FROM: Murray H. Bring We?  SUBJECT: Scientific Article     Attached hereto is an important and interesting recently published article by Dr. Carl C. Seltzer at Harvard. It contains a critical analysis of the Framingham Heart Study, which has been the principal epidemiological study relied upon by the Surgeon General to reach his conclusion that there is a strong, association between smoking and coronary heart disease (CHD).  In this article, Dr. Seltzer disputes the Surgeon General's conclusion and points to a number of unexplained anomalies in the data. The most significant points are:  1. The statistical association between smoking and heart disease is below the level established by Hutchison and Wynder for the conclusion of a strong association. In fact, under the Hutchison-Wynder criterion, the association would be designated as "weak."  2. The Framingham data do not demonstrate any increase in the incidence of CHD based upon the duration of smoking in either men or women.  3. Most significant is the finding that smokers who quit smoking have a lower incidence of CHD than people who have never smoked at all.  Dr. Seltzer concludes that the important Framingham study simply does not support the "conventional wisdom" which the Surgeon General has propagated.  Attachment  Distribution Hamish Maxwell Jiohn A.

Yy’, Sey wr Oe  This memo reviews the study design and rationale behind conducting a package design test which includes Leo Burnett's suggested pack for PM  Blues.  While an ad/pack test is planned, a package design test would provide Marketing with results in a shorter time frame and serve as an early read of smoker interest and choice within the packaging alternatives.  “The test would follow the same format as previous Blues pack test. 300 full flavor menthol smokers would be interviewed with 75% 18-34 years of age and 25% 35-54 years of age. The sample would be evenly divided by sex and size of cigarette smoked.  Eligible respondents would be exposed to each of the three packs, one at a time, on a rotated basis. Following the exposure and rating.of the packs monadically, participants would be shown the three Blues packs — side-by-side and questioned as to their preference and reasons why. Consumers would then be exposed to a few unfinished ads; more specifically, just pictures of people smoking, and then they would be asked to select the one pack which best fits with the pictures of the  people.  Daniel, I will need six sets of packs. I already have the ad pictures needed for this test.  KE/isw Sats 4} Pe qe  SO0vsgErOZ  ‘ __label__Memo

INGLEWOOD NEWS Inglewood, California January 18, 1957  % We Believe  WHERE THERE'S SMOKE...  If you watch television with any de- gree of regularity. it may seem evident to you that salesmanship is responsible for the report that at the end of 1956, the filter-tin variety has captured nearly one- third of the American cigaret market.  On the other hand, science, fear or superstition may have had equally as much todo with this change in the Amer- can cigaret smoker's habits.  Thirteen billion more cigarets were smoked during 1956 in spite of increasing reports linking smoking with lung can- cer. From this, it may be deduced that while the catchy jingles and dramatiza- tions that are presentcd over TV may have had a great deal to do with filter-tip cigaret sales’ increase, the compelling de- sire of smokers to put something between themselves and the possible harmful ef- fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.  So the scare lingers on, -while a prob- ably fictitious faith is being placed in the wide variety of filters on cigarets.  Cigaret companies for many years sought a mild tobacco. Growers sought to supply this demand by carefully breed- ing plants that would turn out a tobacco leaf low in nicotine.  Now the rush seems to be toward the filtered variety of cigarets, so jn order to get some flavor through to the smoker, stronger tobaccos are preferred. The practice has been for the best tebaccos to go into standard cigarets, while the harsher blends are put in front of the filters. Therefore. the flight to filter-tips may in reality be a rush to the kind of tobacco that does the most damage to health.  No one has yet proved conclusively that there is any harmful effect from smoking. but the new trend, induced by the possibilty of such dangers, is causing nothing but confusion to tobacco farmers and plant breeders.  The most confused people in the whole situation, however, may be those smokers who, to reduce their fears about the peril, if any, from smoking are putting them- elves behind filters but by no means cut of all possible harm's wav.  pay Kansas crty sur’! P3003, Kansas City, Missouri  January 15, 1957  A SMOKING TIE 70 CANCER  EXPERTS HERE AGREE RE. LATIONSHIP EXISTS.  Other Forms of Air Pollution Probably Holp Boost Riso in Lung Casas,     Specific laboratory proof that cigaretre smoking causes cancer of the lungs has not been adduced, but five experts conducting a pulmonary dis- ease clinic at the University of Kansas Medical Center to- day agreed that clinical rec- ords indicate a relationship between heavy smoking and such cancers,  However, added the experts, smoking likely is only one of several air pollutions in city life today ihat may be boost- ing the remarkable rise in lung cancers. The other pol: lutions:  Motor car exhausts, especi- ally from use of high-octane gasolines.  Fumes Pervade Air.  Coal fire fumes, more heavy in European than American cities, from home and factory chimneys.  Fuel oil and oil refinery fumes from homes or fac- tories.  Heavy use of macadams and tars for road surfacing.  The experts polled here are Dr. Jobn McClement of Colum- bia university, Dr. Hurley Motley of the University of Southern California. Dr. How- ard Van. Orstrand of the Cleveland clinic, Dr. Julius Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Martin FitePatrick, head of the lung disease section of the K. U. center.  The five also agreed cancer is not the only lung affliction which may be inc!ted by smok- ing and other pollutants. These aggravants often are factors in bronchitis (inflam- mation of the bronchial tubes). which, when chronic, may bring on emphysema, a dis- erder in the lungs’ ability to oxpel air.
