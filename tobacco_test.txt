1) Synopsis of Current Research: There are many drugs of abuse, each of which has a distinctive pharmacology. For example,  stimulant drugs (e.g., amphetamine and caffeine) and depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol and barbiturates) differ in their subjective effects, but both types of drugs are abused. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that certain brain areas play relatively more important roles in the development and maintenance of behaviors related to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Two important pathways are the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways, which emerge from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA). Projection of the neurons of the VTA to the nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic) and to the prefrontal cortex (mesocoitical) appear to be important for the expression of the rewarding properties of a wide variety of drugs of abuse. Most drugs of abuse increase neurotransmission through the mesolimbic-mesocortical sytems, either by increasing activity of VTA neurons (e.g., nicotine, opiates, ethanol) or by augmenting the release of dopamine in the terminal areas (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine). Because the VTA is one important area for the mediation of drug-induced reward, the study of how various abused substances affect neurons of the VTA is a critical for the treatment of addiction.  The overall goal of my research is to develop a better understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of central reward systems. In order to approach this goal, I have developed a brain slice preparation of the VTA suitable for intra- and extracellular recording. Putative dopamine- containing neurons of the mesencephalon have been well characterized electrophysiologically in vivo; neurons in the brain slice appear similar to neurons studied in vivo. VTA neurons fire spontaneously in a slow (0.5 - 5 Hz), regular pattern. We have examined the effects of several drugs of abuse on this spontaneous activity. Among the agents we have examined are cocaine (Brodie and Dunwiddie, 1990) and ethyl alcohol (Brodie, et al., 1990). We are continuing our study of ethanol, by using intracellular recording in an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons. Ethanol appears to cause a slight depolarization, a decrease in the action potential amplitude, and a decrease in the amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization (Brodie and Shefner, 1989). Further experiments are planned to determine whether any of these effects underlies the ethanol-induced excitation of VIA neurons.  We have also investigated the effects of nicotine on the spontaneous activity of VTA neurons (Brodie, 1991). Nicotine excites VTA neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. VTA neurons possess an EC50 for nicotine-induced excitation of about 250 nM; therefore, VIA neurons are more sensitive to the excitatory effects of nicotine than many other central neurons. Furthermore, little desensitization to the effects of nicotine are seen at lower concentrations (less than 1 pM) (Brodie, 1991). The response of VTA neurons to nicotine is blocked by hexamethonium or mecamylamine. VTA neurons also possess pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Brodie and Mueller, 1988; Lacey, et al, 1988), so studies of nicotinic cholinergic receptors must be performed with specific nicotinic agonists, and/or in the presence of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists. With our preparation, a full range of concentrations of nicotine can be applied to the same VTA neuron, which would permit a more precise characterization of the specific receptor subtype involved in mediating nicotine-induced excitation of VTA neurons.  2) Research Plan and Goals of Proposed Research Molecular biologists have identified a number of different subtypes of the nicotinic  cholinergic receptor. It is known that the nicotinic cholinergic receptor is a pentamer formed from 4 subunits: 2 « subunits, and one each of B, y (or e) and 8. Recent studies from a number of laboratories indicate that pharmacological specificity is conferred by the « and B subunits. Five forms of the « subunit («2 - #6) and four forms of the B subunit (B2 - 65) are found in rat brain. Different combinations of the various forms of these subunits constitute functionally different  1 __label__Scientific

ANALYST IMPRESSIONS  I listened to several impromptumedia interviews of Analysts. In general, the Analysts' answers were precise, low-key and  favorable about the development.  They also refused to speculate on questions designed to  elicit a negative and/or controversial response.  John of the Wall Street Journal asked one analyst if this  product failed would it “be like the introduction of new.  Coke?" the answer was:  "Of course not; Coke withdrew a product and RJR is not doing that. Also this is nowhere near the same level of spending  and commitment.  Another analyst said it "is a good move because RJR has nothing to lose here. It's a technological advancement and  that puts them on the leading edge. But, if it doesn't fly  they have really not invested that much.  ui °o a _ wn Ww w ~ oO __label__Report

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: R.N. Ferguson, H. Alonso, P.N. Gauvin Date: November 28, 1988 From:S.D. Baldwin, R.M. Rogers, W.A. Geiszler  Subject: Philip Morris USA’s Needs in Paper Technology. db.     A number of important issues facing Philip Morris can be addressed in large part by means of paper technology. Sidestream smoke reduction, altered mass burn rate, spotting (both in ART and non-ART products), new products and paper breakage during manufacturing all reflect current needs which can be met via modification of the wrapper material itself. Future needs might include the requirement for an exceptionally strong and flexible paper, as cigarette-maker speeds advance to 10,000 units per minute, and pexzhaps ultimately to 12,000 units per minute. Aliso, innovative new products: have requirements for very unusual papers.  In the area of sidestream smoke reduction, for example, modification of  ' the cigarette wrapper has produced very good results. Low porosity papers  and those with very fine particle size inorganic fillers have been successfully used as a: means of reducing sidestream smoke. R&D is currently evaluating materials. with diffierent chemical and physical properties. from those used for roptine papermgking. Extremely high surface area calcium carbonate (72 m'/g vs. 7m /g for normal paper and 22 m‘/g for “standard"  sidestream-reduction paper) has been obtained and is being tested. Initial results are encounaging. Materials with different chemistries, such as magnesium carbonate, have been tested with some initial sucéess. A variety  of mineral paper fillers will also be evaluated, along with several novel synthetic inorganic. compounds to be prepared by A. Kallianos and others within and outside of R&D. Physical and chemical characteriza@ion of papermaking materials will also be performed, so that we can determine why we observe what we do and to gain insight into the mechanisms involived'’,?.  Aliternate paper constructions are aliso being developed in the sidestream program in order to obtain the optimum product with respect to  - both performance and subjective characteristics. Double-wrapping,  laminating of sheets and preparing a layered or gradient sheet all are techniques. which can give us: greater flexibility in addressing a number of  problems. Different materials. can be placed in two sheets or in different strata of the same sheet. B. Goodman has. recently prepared double wrapped cigarettes for the reduction of sidestream smoke*. The outer wrap contained  the generally unpalatable Mg (OH) 5 paper and the inner wrap contained a low porosity, low calcium carbonate sheet. Results have been quite favorable in  ~both sidestream smoke reduction and subjective acceptability.

This observation is almost absurdly simple, yet it has never been noted as far as Professor MacTavish can learn, in any of the scientific literature on the cigarette. Tt is the fact that the angunt of motsture present in the tobacco —- br to put it another way - the "freshness" of the cigarette — controls the quantity of irritating substances formed during combustion. The dryer the cigarette, the more irritating. And a difference in the amount of moisture, which would be imperceptible to the amoker, cen violently effect the results of an analysis.  MacTavish deduced this fact from a atudy of the results of his first test. But to prove it he made a simple test of the smoke from the four cigarettes under controlled moisture conditions and by adding only 2% to Old Gold's moisture was able to make it show up much better than any cigarette in the original test.  Te reason for thia powerful influence of moisture on the amount ef irritants formed is apparentiy that the butt end of the ciga= rette (when the tobacco is relatively moist or "rreah") acts aa  .a condenser and withholds some of the natural irritants from passing into the throat.  But before discussing the possibilities of using this observation to Old Gold's advantage, it would be best to review the original analyais of the four cigarettes. The four brands were bought at . the same time at the United Cigar Store in the Grand Central Sta+ ° tion, and the dealer told Professor MacTavish that they had ail  been received that morning fron the wholesalcr. Premunaply they were equally fresh. But you will observe in the results a con= siderable difference in moisture contont.  These arg the highlights of the original smoke analyals: Oo J : - 7 , ‘ ot 3 > . - . ' mr . , " . - oO  ‘ : a  ee ee eo we ee eo © ON& __label__Memo

All smokings were performed under FTC conditions.. Solutions obtained at each sampling point containing a known amount of internal standard (quinoline) were examined via temperature programmed capillary gas chromatography using mass selective detection. Visual comparison of the resulting chromatograms showed the TM-6 sidestream to be considerably less complex than the 1R4F sidestream at every sampling point.  Quantitation of the resulting peaks (relative to the internal standard) showed that the TM-6 sidestream contains fewer components (96% less in the particulate phase and 82% less in the vapor phase) and less total material (97% less in the particulate phase and 84% less in the vapor phase) than the 1R4F sidestream.

Aller ( Subject: + Suggested Remarks Following Surgeon General's Report     Philip Morris Incorporated is a strong advocate of public ° debate. It is through such discussion and analysis of the issues that our citizens are able to reach their own personal decisions. When, however, a federal government department takes it upon itself to prohibit the making of that free choice,  x  we have moved out of the realm of public discussion and into that of coercion. This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness, has taken us. Rather than devoting his time and money to in- - creased tobacco and health research, he has chosen to expend them on a public relations campaign aimed at making smokers appear as second class citizens whose rights are not worth protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue, _and is of no value in finding answers to public questions. In the last twenty years Philip Morris, along with other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than $70 million for independent research on smoking and health questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded that of any government department, andi has been substantially  more than the research expenditure reported by all the voluntary  health associations combined. 4003040251     1 excerpted from "Facts About The Smoking Controversy" __label__Memo

COMMUNICATING ON THE ISSUES  IN 1975, THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE DECIDED TO TRY A LITTLE EXPERIMENT. OVER THE PREVIOUS DECADE, WE HAD BEEN BATTERED BY THE MEDIA. THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT OF 1964 HAD BEEN BIG NEWS. OUTISDE OF THE MAJOR MEDIA IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND NEW YORK CITY, OUR RESPONSE HAD BEEN MUTED. BUT THAT CHANGED WHEN A GROUP OF INSTITUTE EXECUTIVES HIT THE ROAD AND CONDUCTED  MEDIA BREIFINGS IN A SERIES OF CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.  WHAT WE FOUND WAS GRATIFYING. WE LEARNED THAT THE MEDIA WERE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE HAD TO SAY. THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR NEWS FROM "THE OTHER SIDE." WHAT THEY HAD GOTTEN BEFORE WAS GENERALLY EITHER FROM THE NETWORKS OR WIRE SERVICES. FEW HAD HAD ANY PERSONAL CONTACT WITH A TOBACCO INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE. THEIR REPORTING ON OUR BRIEFINGS WAS GENERALLY FAIR. THAT LEAD US TO CONCLUDE THAT WE NEEDED SOME FULLTIME, PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS ON THE STAFF TO CONTINUE CARRYING THE  MESSAGE AROUND THE COUNTRY.  LATER IN 1975, TWO SUCH PEOPLE WERE HIRED. THE NEXT YEAR, OUR COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE ENDORSED AN EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM AND TWO MORE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONALS CAME ON BOARD. THAT IS WHEN I JOINED TI.

SPECIAL CIGARETTES FOR MARKETING DEPARTMENT  I. Brothers Filter  a. Mold Modifications  The design of the Brothers Filter has been modified on both the exterior and interior of the filter.  The exterior of the filter has been modified in order to improve performance of the filter on the filter making machine and to obtain a design which would be different from the outside of the Parliament mouthpiece. The original structure of the serrated Brothers Filter was such that when cigarettes were made the serrated plug meshed with the roll drum on the making machine and resulted in creasing of the  tipping. Three approaches have been tried to eliminate this:  (1) The section of the roll drum under the filter was filled to give a smooth surface. The creasing effect was eliminated but tipping was wrinkled in spots.  (2) The number of serrations was reduced from 18 to 10 in order to avoid meshing. This eliminated creasing and this type filter will be evaluated more extensively on the making machine.  (3) The outside structure has been designed to give a diamond shaped pattern. A sam- ple of these filters has been shipped and will be tested this: week.     £988 6L7Z0S __label__Report

This tipping is printed  on Schweitzer's GSR-110 basesheet.  The master rolls fave run well on the perforators and slitters. The gold  contral line seems to be working satisfactorily on the Fife guide sensors. It has not been necessary to make slitting knife adjustments to keep the print  in registration on the slitter.  There are areas where some improvement can be: made to the Milprint master rolls:  1. Each master roll should have a unique identification number.  2. The rolls should be stacked with cores vertical, rather than cores horizontal, on the pailliets.  3. The trim from each edge of the master roll broke several times during slitting, especially the trim from the edge without the guideline. Increasing that trim width to 20mm should help prevent the breakage and subsequent entanglement.     {/bjw  cc: R. Carnes Jl. Cooper  098492.000T __label__Memo

Dear John:  It appears to be universal practice for cigarette companies w @ advertise in Spanish display the required health warnings in English. £ am enclosing several advertisements taken from current Spanish publications such aS El Diario, ABC de lag Americas, and Temas. In addition, I sawa lighted display sign in a subway station advertising Kent cigarettes in Spanies, with the warning in tiny Magtish letters.  Six cigarette companies are covered by the consent orders which the FIC accepted on March 30, 1972 (Lorillard, Docket No. €-2180; Phillip Morris Inc., Docket No. C-2181}; American Brands, Inc.,  Docket No. C-2182; Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Docket No. C-2183; R.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, Docket No. C~2184; and, Ligget & Myers Incorporated, Docket No. C-2185).  @ They will certainly argue that their conduct is in precise compliance with the letter of the agreement, which specifies the exact wording of the health warning. The companies, agreed to:  Cease and desist from advertising any  such cigarette unless respondent makes ..-- clear and conspicuous disclosure of the statement prescribed in Section 4 of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-222) which reads:  ZL86 O8Sts  "Warning: ‘The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your Health."

“BIOVITRO - EIDETE  -~ Protein Denaturazation Test              Under the designation "Biovitro", tests were carried out in which tobacco smoke whe  and tobacco smoke fractions or individual smoke components were reacted with biochemically “active materials (for example, ferments, protein).  oe In the year 1938, Rondoni (1) formulated the hypothesis that protern denaturization | and carcinogenisis are interdependent processés. In the following years, different ‘researchers held the # view that carcinogenisis included small strictural changes or | drastic denaturization of biologically active macromolemles. (2,3,4,5,6). That  - tannic acid, phenol and thiourea denaturize protein has long been known, (7). In in-  ~’ dependent tests it was later shown that these substances lead to liver and skin tumors |  "Argus et al. (9) recently reported on this theme. As model substances, they used ‘albumin, “whose reaction with water soluble carcinogens - Like nifrosamines -— was studied. |  ‘this publication (6) was the starting point for our own studies. Since the methods used by the authors“Ttuthidometry, viscosimetry, and measurement of optical activity) seemed too insensitive, we used p-chlormercuribenzoates which react specifically with the - SH - groups.

The present permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm” of air. Upon completion of the survey,  the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic  - analysis.  A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an ISI Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestiform fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper filler particles noted in Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species.

OSHA  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), of the United States Department of Labor, has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on indoor air qualitiy (IAQ) and tobacco smoke. It would impose broad requirements on employers regarding air quality and the operation and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It would effectively prohibit smoking in indoor public places. ‘  Smoking would be banned in restaurants, bars, private clubs, retail establishments, office buildings, government buildings, bingo parlors, bowling alleys, casinos, hotels and motels, sports arenas, and every other indoor space except residences. It is the most far-reaching proposed smoking restriction in history, and would override every less restrictive state and local restriction currently on the books.  It would apply to EVERY workplace, regardless of size, with the exception of sole proprietorships (one self-employed person, with no employees) .  The only “concession" to the reality that 45 million adult Americans smoke is a provision for smoking areas which is so burdensome they are unlikely to be provided by more than a handful of employers, if any. Smoking could legally take place only in ‘separate, designated pon-work areas, which are maintained (ventilated) at a negative pressure compared to surrounding areas and separately exhausted to the outside. Further, no employees  could enter the area for work purposes.  In other words, they could go into the designated area for a “break," and smoke a cigarette, but not to work. Thus, a restaurant or bar could not have a smoking room in which food or drinks were served, or from which dirty dishes or glasses were removed by workers. Even routine cleaning of the designated area/room would have to be done during hours in which no smoking were taking place.  In other words, if this rule is allowed to take effect, there will no longer be a single bar or restaurant anywhere in America (with the possible exceptions of Indian reservations, the United Nations, and foreign embassies and consulates) in which you can be served food or drink while smoking a cigarette (or pipe, cigar, whatever).  ezeg Loses __label__Report

Sf Simmon a) ily “le le  This is to update you on the plan for conducting unscheduled DNA  synthesis (UDS) and SLRL Drosophila assays extramurally. In  conversations with G. Burger and J. Hayes it was confirmed that we  would ask SRI and Litton (Hazelton) to conduct the in-vitro UDS  assay using two samples of cigarette condensate. One sample would  be from a Kentucky reference cigarette (1R4F) and the second  comparative sample would be from a RAN product. The cost | associated with this assay for two (2) samples at SRI would be | $11,000 and at Litton would be $10,400, for a total of $21,400.  Johnnie Hayes has contacted Or. Valencia at Wisconsin and she is  fowarding a price list to us for the Drosophila assay. Litton  charges $23,500 for a routine Drosophila assay. I suggest that we  meet with Gary, Johnnie, Chin, and Bob Suber to decide on a  strategy for submitting samples for the Drosophila assay. 1 estimate that it would cost approximately $100,000 to run two (2)  samples through the Drosophila assay at two labs. This is based upon Litton's price list. This appears to be prohibitive and  should be limited to the minimum number of samples.        Johnnie Hayes is initiating conversations with Litton and I have requested a proposal from SRI to conduct the in-vitro UDS assay. Fach lab will also be asked to provide us with a schedule for initiation of assays and delivery of draft final reports. I expect that we can have contacts in place and can send samples no later  than October 21, 1985.  cc: Dr. A. W. Hayes  Dr. R. L. Suber Dr. G. T. Burger Dr. J. R. Hayes Dr. C. K. Lee Dr. W. Y.

The Office of Technology Assessment memorandum released today demonstrates how little is known about the relationship of  personal behavior to disease and then, in turn, disease to costs.  Unfortunately, the staff of the OTA had little time to study this subject adequately.  If the report is supposed to provide a rationale for legislation earmarking a portion of the federal cigarette excise tax for Medicare, in our view it fails.  The report itself is littered with clever escape-hatch terms such as "estimate", "uncertainty", and "may", words normally used to hedge against legal action. Worse yet, it is based largely on fifteen to twenty-year-old figures, not statistics, lifted from fuzzy "studies" openly sponsored by front rank professional adversaries of tobacco. Could the desired conclusion have been determined in advance of the "study"?  Finally, this government bureau takes a position now, only two weeks before a consumer surtax on some tobacco products will be ended by law. This is blatant intervention confected and released by the staff of an agency to support a regressive tax increase which would cost the poor more than it costs the rich.  Lawmakers and opinion formers should read closely. They will recognize the specious, admittedly vague nature of this non-study. It is simply propaganda, a political press release requested by  one member of Congress.  If OTA does this kind of work in the vital defense and  security areas where it advises the Congress, we have a very  serious problem indeed.

REYNOLDS TOBACCO CALLS FOR COMMON SENSE REGARDING ADVERTISING ISSUES  The debate over cigarette advertising in magazines needs a big dose of common sense.  Critics of our advertising don’t want children to see cigarette ads in magazines published for and read by adults. However, the only way to guarantee that no child ever saw a cigarette ad would be to completely ban cigarette advertising.  The real issue is whether cigarettes should be treated as legal products for adults, and whether manufacturers have the right to communicate with adult smokers.  Cigarettes are already the most restricted consumer product in terms of marketing and advertising, but we have the legal right to advertise in adult smokers in publications that are not youth-oriented.  Does seeing a cigarette ad cause children -- or adults -- to begin smoking? Common sense tells you no. Government and university studies show that peer pressure and family influence are the primary factors in smoking initiation. And common sense tells you that the vast majority of tobacco messages that youth are exposed to today are anti- smoking messages.  So what would further restricting cigarette advertising — or banning it — accomplish? It would be one more step in attempting to make smoking more socially unacceptable — and once again, treating a legal product as if it were illegal. It would deprive cigarette manufacturers of a constitutional right, but it would not resolve the youth smoking issue.  Our standard is to advertise only in publications in which at least two-thirds of the readership is age 18 or older. Further, we evaluate the editorial content of the publications over time to be sure the topics covered are of interest to predominantly adult audiences. We review the other advertisers who appear in those publications to ensure that most are for products which primarily are purchased by adults. We also review factors such as the publications’ circulation dynamics and method of distribution.  The same magazines we advertise in carry ads for other adult products — such as alcohol, household appliances, and furniture. In 1998, the major tobacco companies signed an agreement with the States’ attorneys general that enacted sweeping bans and restrictions  on cigarette marketing. This agreement does not prohibit us from communicating with adults who choose to smoke.     £980 bOtcCS __label__Report

October 30, 1987  MR. J. DOUG SIMPSON  SUBJECT: Funding For Air Purification Device Development, Prototype Construction, and Testing  Assisting in the Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) investigation for Fundamental Research and Development Department at Bowman Gray Technical Center (BCTC), we have designed subject device. Development and testing of this device has the potential of reducing the impact of “ETS” in public buildings particularly food service and entertainment establishments.  We are requesting a grant of $4500 to accomplish subject work. To the best of our knowlewdge at this time these funds will cover the cost of engineering, materials and labor required to fabricate a prototype and testing to develop effectiveness data for this device.  Legal council at BGTC is presently investigating patentability of subject device. A decision should be reached by mid November on this matter.  If this funding is granted and we are advised to proceed with this work the prototype can be constructed and ready for testing by January 1, 1988.  Please advise as to how we can further assist you in this matter.  Gi  Richard P. Lortie, P. &.      RPL: gws (33 76v)  Copy to: Je: Cc. Henderson Cc. W. Nystrom  L76T CbPTS __label__Letter

Dear Mr. Blynn:  T now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston,  attorney for D.D. Bean & Sons, Co, We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by your position.  The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA, As we previously explained, matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of section Ti1(f) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section ll(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are net written or electronic publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(f).  Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that matchbooks may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section HIG) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use. . .any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself.”  Ol9S r6Pes __label__Letter

By William Safire  WASHINGTON, May 15—Carmine DeSapio, boss of Tammany Hall a gen- eration ago, abolished the smoke- filled room uring his tenure as leader because his eyes were sensitive to smoke.  Im that sense at jeast. Mr. DeSapio ds regarded as a prophet without honor tn his own time by members of 2 mew organization. one fiercer and rrore self-righteous than the old Tiger of Tammany: the Group Against Smok- ers’ Pollution (GASP).  Across the nation, GASP chapters have been formed to help shame the 52 million American smokers into re- fraining from indulging their habit in the “breathing space” of nonsmokers.  “Nonsmokers have rights tco” is the slogan of GASP and in its “libera- tion guide” there are tips to members about methods to discomfit those whe discomfort them. Some ideas are forthright—"Speak out against smok- ing!*"—while others are maddening, such as “Discourage smoking by not providing ashtrays.”  So far, so good: In an enclosed space, people who are annoyed by tobacco smoke should make known their irritation to smokers, who should then have the courtesy to desist. Un- fortunately. that is not the last GASP: Buoyed by their success in getting air- Hines to segregate smokers, the non- smokers are pressing their attack with demands for government regulatior. of “breathing space.”  From Barry Goldwater's Arizona to George McGovern’s South Dakota. states have passed laws prohibiting smoking in museums. concert halls, theaters, libranes and elevators.

A little group of willful persons, representing no opinion but thtir own, has rendered the great smoking public helpless and contemptible.  “Where a fire or health hazard exists, nobody disputes that smoking should     de prohibited. But despite the fuming”  of former Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld, no evidence exists to sug- gest that the exhaled smoke of other persons poses a health hazard to non- smokers. A tiny minority is acutely allergic to smoke, and its wishes need to be considered, but public policy ought not to be set to accommodate today’s Carmine DeSapios.  The cigarette smoker is already the target of too many Government agen- cies. He cannot be advertised to on television; he must carry around on every pack a dire warning about kill- ing himself; he is taxed regressively and punitively.  Yet the smoker continues to smoke; in the United States last year, 588 billion cigarettes were puffed, dragged upon and choked over, and thanks to the growing interest in smoking by teen-age girls, the market continues te grow,  This perverseness—the refusal of people to do what is gond for them — activates the antismoking brigade, | think, even more than the annovance caused by the exhalation of the coffin- nailers. If smokers do not respond to reason. to wamings, to the silencing of advertising, to tax disincentives, then perhaps the only way is to make it more difficult to find a place to Nght up.  New York Tines $/16/7L  >. ll  “You are not denying the smoker's right to smoke,” GASP assures its members, “only his/her right to smoke in your breathing space.” Not true; any harassment, especially harassment by executive regulations, is part of «  process that infringes our liberties and  poliutes our statute books.  Today the smoker, tomorrow the  onion-eater, and the day after tomor- Tow the person who prefers cheap perfume to the taking of baths: once Government gets its nose under the tent of social intercourse, there will be no privacy for anyone,  The bossism of the do-gooder is intolerable, even when he/she (fight linguistic pollution) clooks paternal- ism in the guise of selfishness. Not every social inequity needs a legal cure: social, not government, pressure is appropriate to curb the smoker. A giare, a sniff, and if necessary the green-gilled appearance of the onset of motion sickness, should be enough to get a smoker to stub out his butt in a hurry.  T gave up smoking two years ago and it is like Josing a friend, I don’t feel any better, and am not inclined to badger others into sacrificing one of life’s little pleasures. What incenses some people is incense to me; blow some my way.  But the abuse of the power of health agencies to put a governmental fist into the glove of social courtesies is worrisome. A new law separating smoking from nonsmoking areas in Testaurants would invite a smoker's Sit-in at a nonsmoking lunch counter, turning the civil-rights clock back by decades.  in their zeal, the people from GASP have gone too far. we can now look forward to the formation of “People United to Fight for Freedom by Figh:- ing Fire With Fire” (PUFFF).

Smart. (PROJECT B. 491, SA)  Introduction  Samples of a prototype: smokable article (hereinafter called “experimental. cigarettes") were submitted by D. R. Smart for determinatiion of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as. a control.  Experimental  Both. experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in  the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity conditions. for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 9 puffs of each cigarette were collected under standard conditions. using a 35. mL puff volume, 2 seconds in duration, at one minute intervals, then a clearing; puff was. taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 125 mL Dreschel bottle comtaining 50 mL of trapping reagent. The trapping reagent. contained 200 mL of 0.125% dinitrophenyl- hydrazine. (DNPH) in acetonitrile, 20 mL of 1.N perchloric acid, diluted to 500 mL with acetonitrile. After smoking, the DNPH- smoke solution was neutralized with 2 mL of 1 N triethylamine.  The DNPH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC-UV analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M HPLC was equipped with Novapak. (C18) column 3.9: x 150 mm, with a 5 fim particle size. The mobile phase was acettonitrile, water, tetrahydrofuran (60:30:10) with a flow rate off 1 mL/min. An injection volume: of 10 PL was: used. Following each analysis, the column was washed with. acetonitrile at. 2 mL/min for 30: minutes.  Results  The aldehyde deliveries for the experimental cigarettes verses the Kent III’ control cigarettes are reported in Table 1. The aldehyde deliveries were substantially less for the experimental cigarettes.  Ce8S2eLE __label__Memo

Smokers, stores deal with recall  BY CHARLES SLACK TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF WRITER  For the next few days, Philip Mor- ris cigarettes may be harder to find than sissies in Marlboro Country.  Stores in Richmond and around the country began pulling cartons from their shelves after Philip Morris USA on Friday announced a recall of 12 brands and 36 package types. The recalled cigarettes include Marl- boros, the company’s most popular brand, which are made in Richmond.  Defective filters in some ciga- rettes could cause wheezing and diz- ziness, the company said.

Fountaine Date: June 23, 1971  Al Udow  A New Method of Qualitative Product Test Analysis  Background  The following quote is from a memo by E. J. Gray (10/29/69) who, under J. E. Lincoln, developed the current technique:  volume of response indicates the magnitude of a qualitative difference. In other words, the higher the percentage of given responses, the greater we assume the quality to be  wees  The second assumption that seems to exist is a cause and effect assumption. Granted, we rarely make the mistake of saying "Blend B lost the test because it was too strong", the implication is usually present. In other words, "Blend B. lost the test", Later we say "Blend  B was considerably stronger than Blend A". I feel that our readers put these two together.  Since the time that this issue was raised, we have tried two ways of settling the question. The present document is submitted as the third, and possibly definitive answer to the question, with new insights into understanding reasons for preference  of cigarettes, with implied new directions. for interpreting blind product test reports and new directions for R&D efforts.  Summary, Conclusions and: Recommendations  1. This document spells out in detail, and gives five examples of a new technique that should be added to: the analytic devices currently used in evaluating blind product tests. It should be given more weight in interpretation (because of greater sensitivity) than the current reporting of "qualitative evaluation",  2. The data used for this analysis should be drawn from the 18 point check list which smokers are asked to report on after testing each product, rather than the open ends. The former provides fuller data on larger bases, the latter gives some of the same kind of information but on much smaller bases.  3. Certain key conclusions can be generalized from the data on ten different  Products reported here, and they apply to all the groups of smokers covered, (including smokers: of Marliboro 85's, Marlboro 100's, other filters and hi-fi's),  1001857064 __label__Memo

PRASAD, Rebecca A. FULDNER, Richard BRAVERMAN, Elwood MCDUFFIE and Herbert L, COOPER Cell and Molecular Physiology Section, Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, USA  (Received February 21, 1994) — EJB 94 0250/1  _ Expression of the tropomyosin-1 isoform was enhanced by cDNA transfer in non-transformed murine 373 fibroblasts and also in v-Ki-ras transformed fibroblasts in which native tropomyosin-1  expression had been reduced and tropomyosin-  2 synthesis virtually eliminated by action of the  oncogene. The level of synthesis of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 was similar in normal and trans- formed transductants (3-5 times normal levels). The high level of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 expression resulted in a considerable increase in tropomyosin-1 utilization in the cytoskeleton of transformed cells, but this expression still did not reach normal levels, suggesting an oncogene- related inhibition of tropomyosin utilization. A large proportion of newly synthesized native tropo- myosin-1 in normal, unmodified fibroblasts appeared in homodimers which, upon prolonged incuba- tion, were largely converted to the heterodimers. Excess tropomyosin-1 derived from the inserted cDNA also appeared largely as the homodimer in both normal and transformed cells. This homodi- mer was utilized effectively in the formation of cytoskeletal structures but was partially converted  to heterodimer by chain exchange. Under steady: toskeletal tropomyosin-1-containing dimers were  -state conditions, approximately 33% of the cy- homodimers, compared to approximately 10% in  normal fibroblasts. The results show that the increased amounf of tropomyosin-1 homodimer enter- ing the cytoskeleton under conditions of tropomyosin-i excess, results in an atypical microfilament composition. The effect of this excess of tropomyosin-1 homodimers on stability or function of microfilament fibers remains to be determined. The results also confirm that the mechanisms of  rapid homodimer formation with conversion to vitro studies, also occur in vive.  The synthesis of several microfilament-associated pro- teins, including tropomyosin (Cooper et al., 1985), vinculin (Raz and Geiger, 1982, Fernandez et al., 1992), a-actinin (Gluck et al., 1993), and gelsolin (Vandekerckhove et al., 1990) have been reported to be suppressed in neoplastically transformed fibroblasts. Among these, tropomyosin has been extensively studied.  Tropomyosins are a family of ubiquitous actin-binding proteins with extensive a-helical structure that play a well- defined role in muscle contraction (Leavis and Gergely, 1984; Payne and Rudnick, 1985, Lees-Miller and Helfman, 1991), In non-muscle cells, the role of tropomyosins is less clearly understood, and it is generally thought that they are involved in stabilization of actin microfilaments which, in tum, play an important role in maintaining cell shape, motil-  Correspondence to G.

The terminology of tropomyosins used in this study is one in general use for tropomyosins expressed in fibroblasts (Lea- vitt et al., 1986). Tropomyosins-1—3 correspond, in increas- ing order of electrophoretic mobility, to the high-M, tropo- myosins (284 amino acids), which are homologous to tropo- myosins expressed in muscle cells, while tropomyosin-4 and tropomyosin-5 correspond to the low-M, tropomyosins (247 or 248 amino acids) characteristic of non-muscle cells. The reader is also referred to footnote 2 of Lehrer and Qian (1990) regarding the terminology of smooth muscle tropo- myosins. A number of studies have shown that down-regula- tion of expression of the high-M, tropomyosin isoforms con- sistently accompanies neoplastic transformation of murine and avian fibroblasts by a variety of retroviral oncogenes, chemical mutagens and transforming growth factors (Hen- dricks and Weintraub, 1981; Leonardi et al., 1982; Matsu- mura et al., 1983; Hendricks and Weintraub, 1984; Cooper et al., 1985, 1987; Leavitt et al., 1986).

NEW YORK, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1971  212 682-3576  ORGANIZED IN 1935  WHOLESALE TOBACCO DISTRIBUTORS OF NEW YORK, Inc.  © 1971 New York Pest Corporation     See New Cigaret Tax as Bootleggers' Dream  By RON HOLLONDER  If the state tax on a pack of cigarets is raised six cents, a move the Legisla- ture is considering, the city will be an even more attrac- tive ground for bootleggers.  The boost would bring the total tax in the city to 22 cents-a-pack, (plus sales tax of another three cents) as opposed to current state cigaret taxes of 14 ‘cents in New Jersey, 16 cents in  Connecticut, 13 cents in Rhode Island and 18 cents in Pennsylvania. But North  Carolina, the state from which millions of cigarets are bootleged into the city each year, would still have a tax of only two cents a pack.  This 20-cent-a-pack differ- ence is the incentive for boot-  leggers to make the journey from North Carolina to New  York, their tru ith false, backs ipg the etal cargo. toa  or their cars with abbreviated gas tanks crammed with thousands of cartons of brand-name cigarets.  The cigarets are then sold to a middle-man who in turn sells them, several cartons at a time, at plants, factories and offices.  This week, the Cigaret Tax Enforcement unit of the state's Special Investigations Bureau stopped a small de- livery van loaded with 2,316 cartons of cigaretes bearing the North Carolina tax decal but no New York tax stamp.  Alerted beforehand that the truck bearing the con- traband was heading for New York, four agents in three cars started following van as soon as it entered New York. The driver, growing suspic- ions, ran three red lights to determine whether he was being followed and tried to shake the agents:  é  Unable to "lose them, . he  suddenly parked the truck and ran. He escaped but the truck and cigarets were con- fiscated. The cigarets are worth $10,000 if sold at the legitimate market price of about $4.25 a carton. If dis- tributed illegally, they would bring about $7000. They cost about $2000 in North Caroli- na. Last year 120,000 carton of contraband cigarets were seized by the state agency, almost all of them in the city. There is no reliable of- ficial estimate of how many got through undetected.  Persons entering the state may bring with them two cartons for their own use. Above that they must pay the state’s tax, and the packs would then be marked with a stamp bearing the state seal.  In 1968, iniporting more than 100 cartons of untaxcd  , ejgarcts was made a. fclony  punishable by up to. five  c  years imprisonment. Pay- ment of the state cigaret tax is also required on cigarets bought through the mail, even if the original pur- chase price doets not in- clude the tax. A federal law requires anyone in one state mailing cigarets to persons in another state to notify that state’s tax agency of the name and address of the receiver of the cigarets. The tax agency will then send him a bill.  The Cigaret Tax Enforce- ment unit has 70 men stak- ing out various entry points into the city and inspecting cigarets being sold for the proper state stamp. Arrests have been made at La Guar- dia and Teterboro airports, where contraband has been flown in, and at but stations, where smugglers were caught on interstate buses.  Most of the cigarets come  lages along Interstate High- way 95, which the agents call “Tobacco Road.” Gas stations along this route have signs advertising cheap cigarets. Often the stations are just a front for the warehouses 1> cated Sehind them,  The smuggling business in untaxed cigarets is so prof't- able that tobacco company trucks bse Seen hijacked en route to the city, cases of cig- arets intended for South Am- erica and therefore unstamp- ed have been stolen from piers and bootleggers have even ?djacked competitors’ trucks.  The Cigaret Tax Enforce- ment unit asks anyone having information on suspiciously low-priced or unstamped ecig- arets to call CO 7-1617.

TOBACCO AND FILLER  A.  The following compounds were identified in the 8-glucosidase  hydrolyzate of the E-55 glucosidic fraction by Dr. F. Hsu  using GC/MS: 3-methyl-l-butanol, 2-methyl-2-buten-l-ol, 3—hexen-l-ol, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethylalcohol, 2-methy1-5-(2-methyl-5-isopropenyl tetrahydro-2-furyl) furan (tentative identification), 3-oxo-a-ionol, blumenol C, 4-(3-hydroxybutylidene)-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexone (two isomers), cadineol, and hydroxysolavetivone (two isomers).  Propyl paraben determinations have been made on 45 RL samples and size. Size samples at timed intervals during a Pilot Plant run showed no concentration variation over several hours. RL sheet samples analyzed randomly indicated a small amount of application cycling in concentration levels. Standard response in the range of 100 to 2200 ng/yl was linear. Lower limit of detection under current analytical practices is 1.20 ng/ul. The RL sheet generated will be made into cigarettes to determine dust generation from RL as well as possible transfer of propyl paraben to non-RL blend  components.  We are currently working with Ms. E. T. Oakley in developing a procedure for estimating oriental tobacco in cigarettes. The methyl ester of 8-methylvaleric acid is used as the marker for oriental. Contributions from bright and burley tobaccos appear to be minimal (<10 ug/g versus 950 ug/g for oriental).  Preliminary results with synthetic Marlboro blends show good correlations, but B-methylvaleric acid concentration ranges in various grades of oriental from different countries need to be determined.  A procedure is being developed for determining C2-C,. volatile fatty acids in tobacco and filler. Although we were not successful with butyl ester derivatives because of dilution problems, benzyl ester derivatization shows promise. This procedure involves the reaction of the tetrabutylammonium salts of the acids with benzyl bromide in acetone.  ai S ar oo ~ “I an si Ne or __label__Scientific

OVERVIEW: TEENAGE SMOKING ISSUE AND PROGRAM  The Issue     Most simply stated, the “teenage smoking” issue involves the  accusation that cigarette companies use sophisticated marketing  techniques to tempt youngsters to smoke; that children who enjoy  smoking are likely to continue and, as time goes by, may have  difficulty quitting. Ultimately, it is then argued, the years of  an: Though the accusation is flawed in many ways, our critics use  it regularly with good effect. It is used as a.rationale for labeling and sampling legislation and as an argument for  prevention of use of live models in cigarette brand advertising.  It was prominent among the reasons why cigarette companies no  longer advertise on radio and television.  The industry's response has: been clear but passive. In  a  publications, advertising, testimony and in other public  appearances, Institute representatives regularly state that  siioking is a matter for informed, adult choice.  An Advertising Code, aimed at discouraging promotion to children, was adopted in 1965 though the voluntary agency charged  with monitoring adherence to the code was disbanded earlier this  year after several years of inactivity.

© REASON FOR NOMINATION: % (SPECIFICALLY describe why your nominee(s) deserve the award you a are recommending.) _*  | BELIEVE THIS PERSON (OR TEAM) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THE AWARD BECAUSE: INTRODUCTION  Fibrous glass has been perceived by some as potentially of toxicological significance. Product prototypes of XDU utilize a special form of fibrous glass in their manufacture. To assure that no significant amount of fibrous glass can be transferred to the XDU mainstream smoke, scientists in the Toxicology Division and the Regulatory and Scientific Affairs Division established a program to measure mainstream fibrous glass transfer. The implementation of this  program by Mr. Jerry Avalos, Mr. Keith Shreve and Mr. Guy Spence Is the basis for their consideration as recipients of the "China Breaker Award”:  THE PROGRAM  The program to measure the fiber transfer in mainstream XDU smoke requires many steps. The principal steps include:  1) identifying and preparing standards of fibrous glass to be used in assessing the efficiency of transfer in each phase of the smoke collection effort, 2) identifying and implementing an appropriate smoke collection system compatible with the endpoints to be measured and 3) identifying and utilizing a quantitative technique for counting  the fibers that may be transferred in the smoke. Each of these principal steps is comprised of many smaller, but significant efforts as well.  At the time of program initiation, a timeline was agreed upon that was based on management's best scientific understanding of the problem and the need for a rapid response. Jerry, Keith and Guy understood that they would be under significant pressure to meet the goals of the program from day-one, and were, of course, willing to give  their best efforts. Everything was outlined and work could proceed as planned. This is when the story becomes interesting.  WHY A "CHINA BREAKER AWARD"  Jerry, Keith and Guy knew from conversation with management that the earlier the program could be completed the better for the Company in a number of areas. Rather than just conduct the study as outlined, they discussed the program among themselves and identified several alternative approaches that just might be faster, less expensive, and less labor-intensive. They chose an alternative approach and went to work to demonstrate its potential.  Rather than employing scanning electron microscopy to visualize and count the fibers that may be collected in the  fiber transfer studies, they chose to use polarized light microscopy with an interface to a video tape recorder and television monitor. This approach was validated by the team and proved to be very advantageous.  The advantages include:  1) The elimination of sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy, an effort that required about an hour per sample;  2) A reduction of time for sample quantitation from four hours to 20 minutes per sample;  3) The elimination of a major dependency on sophisticated instrumentation (SEM) with a high demand for utilization on many high priority company programs;  4) Eliminated subsequent project interruptions for those other programs within the Company that depend on the availability of scanning electron microscopy;  5) A reduction in labor necessary to provide the data of interest;  6) A permanent record could be developed to demonstrate the quantification process for each sample on video tape.  0998S 2LeIS __label__Report

DATE: July 25, 1972 MATERIAL: Synthetic Chemical  SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT a Segment I ~ General Reproduction Performance - Rats  Project No. 642-108  SUMMARY  This study was initiated to evaluate the effect of a synthetic chemical on the general reproductive performance of albino rats. The test material was administered orally to male albino rats for 60 days and to female albino rats for 14 days prior to mating at dosage levels of 0, 15, and 75 mg/kg/day. Approximately one-half of the females were sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation and Caesarean sections were performed. The renaining females were allowed to deliver normally, and the litters  “were carried to weaning. Administration of the test compound continued  throughout the study.  All parental animals survived the study, and no outstanding effects were noted in the males or females. .  There were no meaningful differences in the number and placement of implantation sites, resorption sites, and live fetuses among the females sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation.  Fertility indices for the animals that received the test  material were not meaningfully different from the controls.

CHARGE NUMBER: 6904  PROJECT TITLE: BIOCHEMICAL METHODS DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION  PERIOD COVERED! March 1-31, 1982  PROJECT LEADER: R. M. McCuen  DATE OF REPORT: April 1, 1982  1. L5178Y THYMIDINE KINASE MUTATION ASSAY?:?     From recent experiments andi a reevaluation of all the data concerning potential inactive (negative) chemicals tested in this system, two agents in presence or absence off microsomal activation were found to produce no mutagenic response: while causing a dose related: increase in toxicity. The chemicals demonstrating these effects, and thus. were judged to be inactive in this bioassay, were ethanol and nicotine (tested as nicotine tartrate). Both of these ageniis have been termed negative in other in vitro and. in vivo: assays. The importance of this work is that in our laboratories this bioassay does not show that every agent tested produces a positive biological response. For any in vitro assay to be useful, it must be able to distinguish between chemicals which are known to give a positive or negative response in other test systems. With these experiments, we now have more confidence in the ‘usefulness of the L5178¥/TK'/- bioassay at PM.     2. V79' CHINESE HAMSTER CELL MUTATION ASSAY?     An excellent dose response was obtained using these cells treated with DMBA and hamster liver S9.as the source of activation. As expected, no response was observed in the absence of S9. [In the previous experiment, little or no dose-response was seen with hamster S9 because too high a dase was tested.] A second experiment was completed this month using DMBA and and rat Hiver $9 as the source of activation. [Rat liver S9 is the activation system of choice used in other ini vitro assays at PM.] The results from. this experiment revealed that, as expected, DMBA was. active only im the presence of rat liver $9. An almost linear, four point. dose response was observed. The most important finding was that at least for this chemical the shape and magnitude of the dose response curve was. almost identical regardless of the source of the microsomal activation (rat. or hamster liver $9). This. suggests that rat liver S9:' can be used in future experiments where metabolic activation is required,     3. REFERENCES  1. Penn, d. M. and Ayers, D. J. Notebook No. 7669, pp. 127-130. 2.

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  F. G. Owen DATE: December 7, 1989  SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST AT LPF  Objectives;  1.  Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration (PPM) within a hogshead of strip.  Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application and process systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).  Determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene) results  generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using the GC method and results generated at PM using the HPLC method.  Conclusions:  1.  The average amount of variation in the Kabat concentration for the fifteen (15) hogsheads which were sampled during the test was 1.1 PPM. The "projected" average variation in the fourteen (14) hogsheads which were not sampled was 1.3 PPM. Based on a 95% confidence interval of the overall average variation, the Kabat concentration within an individual hogshead can vary by + 2.4 PPM around the average value.  The Kabat flow for each system was set at a rate which was calculated to achieve a projected Kabat value of 7.5 PPM at a constant rate of tobacco throughput. The variation in each Kabat system at LPF was determined on  a 95% confidence interval. The data for each of the systems is as follows:     System er# NL _x_ Projected Ae a foroaee sx_ 95% CI. 1 49 5.7 7.5 - 1.8 1.3 + 2.6 2 49 6.0 7.5 - 1.5 1.3 + 2.7 3 49 6.2 7.5 - 1.3 2.2 + 4,3  All parameters were held as steady as possible during the tests which were conducted, therefore the estimates of variation for each system are probably the best that can be achieved at this time. Under normal operating conditions, the variation would probably be greater.  0769AF  ESOSTPEZO? __label__Memo

Nevertheless small, homogeneous, membrane-  bound, intracytoplasmic bodies measuring 25 my. appeared fairly well  _ preserved (Fig. 2).  Transplantation Studies  Aliquots of the neoplasm were inaediately placed in cell- impermeable chambers of the Millipore type (0.45 bo pore diameter), which were implanted intraperitoneally into 10 male and female Wistar rats weighing 150 - 200 gm. Two chambers were placed in each animal in such a manner as to permit their approximation to the lateral surface of the abdominal wall. A detailed account of this procedure has becit reported elsewhere.  _Laparotony was performed at 4, &, and 14 days after implantation, “at which times the contents of the chambers were transplanted to cheek pouches of adult golden hamsters of both sexes, weighing 45-60 g. Suc- cessful transplants were then passed into other hauster cheek pouches, No host-conditioning was employed. Our method of hamster cheek pouch transplantation has also been described previously, 21514  Portions of the tissue removed from the chambers, as well as the cheek pouch transplants, were fixed in either 10% neutral formalin or Zenker's acetic fluid, and sections prepared from paraffin-imbedded tissue were stained as above for light microscopy. Several tumors  were also fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and processed as above for  electron microscopy. __label__Scientific
TIMES  THE NEW YORK  June llth, 1955     $25,000,000 STUDY ! OF SMOG: PROPOSED  Five-Year U.S, Survey Asked -—Federal Aid to Localities Envisaged in Program  By BESS FURMAN  Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, June 11—A $25,000,000 five-year study of : “community air pollution" was; Proposed today by an interde- partmentat Federal committee  created last December.  The President had asked Mrs,. Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. to set up the committee after a’ group of California Congress- men had come to him with their: smog troubles.  The proposed $25,000,000 atudy would be much broader in. scope than one proposed in the bill for 2 $3,000,000 study, spon- sored by Senator Thomas H.| Kuchel, Republican of California. | This bill hag passed the Senate: and now is pending in the House j of Representatives. :  Closer to this plan is the smog bill sponsored by Senator Homer, E. Capehart, Republican of In-; diana, which set no ceiling on: appropriations for a broad-scale air pollution study. This bill also has passed the Senate, as a rider on the housing bill, .  House bills calling for Federal air pollution studies are spon- sored by John H, Ray, Repubti-. can of Staten Island, New York, - & locale which often gets the laden breezes irom the New Jer- sey industrial flats; by Repre-.      . sentatives Peter J. Frelinghuysen  Jr., Republican, and Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat, of New! Jersey; and by Representatives: Edgar W. Hiestand, Republican,: and James Roosevelt, Democrat,: of California,  The Interdepartmental Com-: mittee on Community Air Pol lution included representatives. of ; the Public Health Service of Mrs.: Hobby’s department; the Bureau. of Mines of the Interior Depart- ment; the Bureau of Standards/ and the Weather Bureau of the! Department of Commerce; the: Agricultural Research Service of the Department of Agriculture: the Office of Navy Research, De- partment of Defense; the Na- tional Science Foundation and the Atomic Energy Commission. Surgeon Generali Leonard A. Scheels of the Public Health Service served as chairman. Five meetings were held.     Permanent Group Urged  The committee recommended that the proposed anti-pollution program be administered by the  partment of Health, Educa- tion and Welfare with the assistance of 2 permanent inter- departmental committee repre- senting the departments and agencies that participated in the ad hoe deliberations.  It defined “community air pol- lution,” a term coined in distine- tion to industrial-site air pollu. tion and atomic fall-out as: “The presence in the ambient atmosphere of substances put there by the activities of man in concentrations sufficient to in- terfere directly or indirectly with his comfort, ‘safety or health, or with full use and en- Joyment of his property.”  The report specifically stated: “In general, it does not refer to the atmospheric pollution inci- dent to employment in areas where workers are employed, nor is it concerned with airborne agents of communicable disease, nor with overt or coverts acts of war.”  The responsibilities of the states and localities and of the Federa? Government in coping with this modern problem atso were defined by the committee.  Regulatory control of com- munity air pollution, its report stated, is the province of state and local governments, except with regard to radioactive air pollution resulting from opera- tions directly controlled by the Federal Government or inter-, State and international air pol- lution,  However, the report also} stated, the Federal Government should provide supplementary Support and assistance to state, local and other agencies includ-| ing private organizations in technical and operational Brab- lems or situations beyond their| cence ‘This ts the helpful role; en y the proposed $25,-| 000,000 program. .  The Assistant Surgeon Gen- eral, Mark Hollis, chief of the Division of Sanitary Engineer- ing Services, said that the Pub-! lic Health Service already has! air pollution experts at work in| Los Angeles.

To that end, enclosed are the slides from  PM's presentation at the April 1, 1998 Panel meeting. The presentation merely outlines one testing approach for possible presentation to the government at some point in the future. The presentation also may serve as an outline for a paper to  be published by the industry.  At its April 1° meeting, the Panel agreed that the companies would evaluate PM's presentation, then take the following steps in preparation for another meeting to be held  in May 1998:  e Determine the extent to which each company is willing to share its testing approaches with other Panel members or the members of the yet-to-be-formed expert panel. Also consider how such presentations would be made {e.g., written papers versus oral briefings). These presentations presumably would be made at the 4  May 1998 meeting. on Xo  ® Identify those assays that, in the opinion of each Fs company, are not appropriate for testing ingredients. 2 on  e Provide thoughts regarding the composition and role of the expert panel. Drs. Frawley and Squire, and possibly Doull, already have been suggested as panel members. __label__Memo

Di Marco  APPLIED R&D WEEKLY STATUS REPORT  G-7 Extract Blending .  An alternate approach to G-7 preparation which features blending of extracts for application to a base sheet has looked promising on initial tests. A second series of pilot line tests of G-7 extract blends is scheduled for March 18, 1985. Four ex- perimental G-7 products from a previous test are to be incorpo- rated into WINSTON KS products for consumer testing. Scheduling for this test is currently being arranged through the Full Flavor  Non-Menthol Matrix Team.  Increased Oriental Scrap in G-7  Work is underway to utilize oriental scrap, which was pre-  viously added directly to blends, in G-7. Tests have been ini- tiated to determine the effect of added Oriental scrap on G-7 smoking quality. Oriental scrap levels of 4%, 6%, and 8% of G-7 blend will be tested on the raw materials panel. SED discrimina- tion panel testing of four major brands containing the test G-7  will be performed.  Hercules Co-Extruded Polypropylene Film  Hercules has submitted a sample of a new co-extruded poly- propylene film for evaluation. A test has been scheduled for the week of March 13 to evaluate this film. The purpose is to develop a film that will possess moisture barrier properties equivalent to currently used Norprop co-extruded film. A 30-day moisture loss study will be conducted using Norprop co-extruded  as the control.  0610 LZHOS — __label__Letter

This review has been developed in collaboration  with A. Mosberg and C. Coggins:  I. Evaluation of Cardiovascular Effects 1. Vascular Reactivity of the Coronary Circulation  Determine acute coronary vasculature spasm in models such as dogs, primates and possibly man produced by reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette smoke and nicotine.  2. Vascular Reactivity of the Cerebral Circulation  Changes in cerebral circulation can be determined by near infrared spectroscopy using animal models such as the cat and baboon and possibly man. The effect of reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette smoke and nicotine can be determined.  Critique  9 Dr. Crapo suggest factors such as pyrolysis products, CO and nicotine can have an effect on _ these variables. The studies as outlined do not adequately separate out which factors (if any) may produce observed effects (if any). __label__Letter

Key Cbs  Evaluate ROOL!g performance {all styles) at predominantly Hispanic retail cutlets.  Evaluate Hispanic marxet performance of all brands and segments in general to determine growth opportunities.  Evaluate in-store presence of al] brands and in-store promotional activity.     The Hispanic market in Pheenix is clearly a full-taste non-menthel murket. Marlboro an¢ Winston are far and away the leading brands. At best, menthol usage among Hispanic smokers is about equal to the E al average (30%), In ne way does menthol usage in the Hispanic community resemble that of the Black community. There does not appear to be any stigma asgociated with menthol cigarcttcs however,            KOOL and Salem full-taste styles are neck and neck in the Phoenix Hispanic market but neither is considered by siore managers to be a fast mover in compazisen to Marlboro and Winston,  Low 'tar' brands, menthol and non-menthol, nave exhibited only marginal growth among Hispanics according to the trade. Roughly 10-20% of brands stocked in stores in the heart of the Hispanic com- munity were hi-fi's.     Very litile promotional activity was observed at retail in the Hi nie market, A few American “pack tape-on" displays were observed as well ag some blister pack lighter offers far Decade. The receptivity of the trade ic on-pack promotional items varied. Cigarette coupon redemption was reported to be low to non-existent.            SILEISOLG __label__Memo

Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: August 2, 1993  From: _ T. Holland 49h ww . Subject: Cast Leaf - Monthly Development Summary - July 1993  NBL Product Development  Marlboro configuration cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 15 parts ammonia) produced during the April trial at the current BL Plant line speed (350 fpm) and at increased line speed  (390 fpm) were evaluated by the Flavor Technology panel and found to have subjective parity with the Marlboro control. When submitted to the Richmond panel, differences were detected, however, the opinion of the panelists were that NBL is close subjectively and could achieve  parity with fine tune adjustments to the dryer profile.  A BL plant factory trial was conducted in May to produce NBL at 390 fpm with a reduced ammonia formulation from 15 parts to 10 parts. Air sampling was conducted on Line 1 to confirm the reduction of ammonia in the dryer emissions. Preliminary results indicated a 40% reduction in ammonia emissions (normalized to production throughput) was achieved which is in line with expected reductions based upon theoretical calculations.  Cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 10 parts ammonia) produced in the May trial have been produced and are scheduled for evaluation by the Flavor Technology panel the week of  August 2, 1993. NBL Commercialization  A cost estimate to retrofit the BL Plant with the minimum essential equipment to produce NBL at an increase line rate of 390 fpm has been prepared. The estimated cost is $3.2 million  total capital and expense which would generate a 42.0 % ROI based upon reduced overtime at the BL Plant to produce forecasted production of 47 million pounds. An implementation schedule will be established after review with Environmental Engineering to assess the implications of implementing NBL with regards to timing and environmental control requirements for the environmental permit at the BL plant site.  With conversion of the BL Plant to NBL, the facility would have the capability to produce Cast Leaf with the addition of a guar gum feeder.  GG6E6S60506 __label__Memo

23, FELDMAN, PIERCE, MoauLlS?sd  INTEROFFICE MEMO  DATE: December 28, 1994  TO: Don Ford, Ph.D.  FROM: Henry T. Lynch, M.D.  SUBJECT: Mark R. Green, M.D. #4148 "Lung Cancer: Tissue  Acquisition and Molecular Analysis" SECONDARY REVIEWER:  Dr. Green hypothesizes that heritable genetic characteristics are important in conferring variable susceptibility to the initiation and promotion of lung cancer. Should a molecular genetic foundation for this hypothesis be found, it could then provide elucidation with respect to the evolution of lung cancer. This would then have implications for early detection, therapy, and possibly even prevention through identifying high-risk individuals. Such a molecular genetic loci could also enable the determination of genetic targets for environmental carcinogens within the lung. This could involve chemoprevention.  Dr. Green will attempt to identify genetic components which may play an etiologic role in the transition of normal lung tissue to lung cancer. This will involve differential mRNA Display PCR (mRNA "fingerprinting") (DDP) and Representational Difference analysis (RDA) which are recently developed molecular techniques which have promise in terms of permitting rapid identification of molecular variances at the genomic and transitional level between neoplastic and normal tissue counterparts. These methodologies will be employed in Dr. Green's grant.  It is anticipated that between 25 to 40 patients per year will be recruited, at which time blood draws and tissue procurement will be attained. These patients will be interviewed and seen in the Multi-Disciplinary Second Opinion Lung Cancer Clinic. This interview will include their smoking history.  The aims will include the mentioned molecular genetic methodologies which, if successful, may be able to address the P.I.'s hypothesis. With some degree of optimism, this could then translate into the clinic.  This is a well thought-out study which is based on methodologies at the cutting edge of molecular biology. The patient and specimen collection should be readily facilitated in that Dr. Green is the Director of the Program for Lung Cancer Research and Head of the Lung Cancer Clinical Research Program at the UCSD Cancer Center. This is a highly pertinent study.  Merit A.  CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O. IN US v. PM ETAL. 99CV2496 (SCIENTIFIC PEER-REVIEW MATERIAL) __label__Scientific

The procedures are in compliance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual with one exception. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual states that Disposal Notices are signed by functional heads, whereas these procedures indicate that Disposal Notices are signed by department managers.  The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual will be revised to indicate that  this is the responsibility of department managers.  It has been recommended to the Records Management Joint Task Force that these procedures be included in the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual as an  appendix, and a decision on this matter is pending.  These procedures should prove to be highly beneficial in assuring that your department's records are managed in accordance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Program, and it is anticipated that you will realize greater efficiency in managing records upon implementation of these procedures.  If you have any questions or require interpretation of these procedures, please contact me at extension 5349,  Attachment c: Cc. L. Brown, Jr. B. J. Horan W. J. Campbell R. Jones B. J. Case _W. R.

PROJECT TITLE 2: «=BIOTECHNOLOGY PERIOD! COVERED 2: JUNE! 1933: WRITTEN! BY >: Berney-J. (JBE)  OC or ee  OBJECTIVES  To isolate, count and identify microorganisms that can be found on different tobaccos: and to screen them for their ability to denitrate tobacco extract.  STATUS  Denitration : The isolated yeast strains. Nos. 1011, 1014 and 1018 were re-tested for growth: and denitration in tobacco extract and in. yeast extract / peptone / dextrose broth. The growth rates in tobacco extract were between 0.45 and 0.6 hr and in yeast extract between 0.65 and 0.8 hr -, .  Strain 1011 was used for a. growth and denitration trial. in  the: fermentor. The trial. was not successful. A reason may be that on the contrary to the shaken flask trials, the PH was controlled. Agitation and aeration were also very. ditferent. The: trial will. be repeated.  Identification : Identification of the isolatedi yeasts was terminated. finally, 11 strains. out of the 25 were found to be identical.     Bacteria : A minimal (salt) medium, supplied with nitrate or nitrite as a mitrogen source and ethanol as a carbon source, was used to isolate denitrating and. denitrifying bacteria both aerobically and anaerobically. Different strains were: isolated and are currently being; tested to determine their characteristics (2).  Plans : - Repeat the denitration trial in the fermentor using strains 1011, 1014 and ioue?. - Test Lsolated bacteria for denitration. / denitrification. - Isolate bacteria at higher temperatures. - Continue efforts for the identification of bacteria.

H KBL33U0S83 July i 1P 82  Afbbcation ft i4yy  peterres For ssfe Wiel Abel lee  Critique of Busbee Application  The staff, Dv, Brennan and I met Dr. Busbee during the meeting of the CTR in June 1982 where he presented  his data.  In principle, the work is concerned with the transport of aromatic hydrocarbons (H3) carcinogen by serum components. In addition, the importance of binding  of lipofilic carcinogens by lipoproteins and their uptake is being explored. It was therefore logical for Dr. Busbee to suggest a correlation between LP and the action of carcinogens. Not, Oo logical is his invocation of carcinogen-initiated hypeplastic growth of cells and human atherosclerosis. In this connection he quotes (in reference 7) Benditt, who has demonstrated the tumor-like growth of smooth muscle cells, but who never  mentioned any connection with lipofilic carcinogens. This connection is most tenuous.  It is also natural for Dr. Busbee to invoke the work of Goldstein on LDL receptors.  He attempts to demonstrate the close connection between  transport of carcinogen (PAH) by lipoproteins; and the initiation of DNA synthesis in treated cells.  TECHNIQUE:  The lipoprotein preparation is quite interesting because he uses a method which he claims is new and more simple than others and that is the TSK-250 column which originated  in Japan. I have no experience with this column, since  most peonle use differential ultra-centrifugation or heparin- Manganese methods. The binding of LDL with benzopyrene  which is labeled is investigated. A further step, of course, is the binding of carcinogens to cellular components. He uses human lymphocytes in this connection.  The last step is an investigation of carcinogen binding of lymphocytes to DNA, and the incorporation of tritiated thinidin into lymphocytes.  In principle, therefore, the investigation consists in isolation of low density lipoprotein, demonstration of binding of the carcinogen and the effect of this binding complex to the uptake and effect on DNA synthesis in the cell. __label__Report

Giles Manager, Analytical Research Period Covered: July I, 1980 through September 30, 1980 Re: QUARTERLY SECTION RESEARCH REPORT  No. of Pages: 6  |. CIGARETTE BEETLE CONTROL. Project 7131 (Personnel: Bellin, Hutchens, Brooks)  -  Due to a mild winter and an unusually long hot summer, cigarette beetle counts for the season have been excessively high. A total of 4,475,800  beetles has been trapped to date. This is the largest number of insects trapped since the summer of 1976, a season which required a large number  of fumigations following a mild winter. Forty-four shed fumigations have been completed this quarter. Twenty-two of these have been at Davie County storage. This is 85% of the Davie sheds which contain tobacco. Rapid buildup of insect populations has necessitated fumigating in two locations  at the same time. This is the first time in the history of the insect control program that this has been necessary.  The insecticidal fogging schedule at Davie has been increased to six  nights each week. All other locations are being fogged every other night (three times each week).  A sample of each DDVP mix has been analyzed by Mr. David Heavner. Concentrations of DDVP in the mixes ranged from 9.5%-13.3%. The correct concentration is 9.3%. The meter-which measures kerosene was found to be  in error and has been replaced with a new one. Analysis of the latest mix, using the new meter has not been completed.  Counts from factory traps are up to date. The increased number of beetles in the traps from the receiving areas indicates that insects are betng brought into the factories from the high infestations in the sheds. This could lead to higher customer complaints due to insects.  Application of Kabat R +o tobacco at the Brook Cove stemmery has been completed. A total of 93.5 gallons of Kabat R was used to treat 3,318,192 pounds of stems (9.24 ppm) and 95.5 gallons used to treat 3,232,223 pounds of strips (9.69 ppm). The calculated rate of application was 10 ppm. The cost of the chemical to treat this tobacco was $22,680.  The stems are stored in cardboard boxes and the leaf in poly-wrapped Tersa bales. The tobacco is stored in Shed 435 at Brook Cove. The shed is not being fogged nor will it be fumigated. Insect counts will be monitored  “closely and temperature and humidity measurements taken weekly during the test period. The insect count in the shed to date is 4,263.  NN  ghL9 LZE0S __label__Report

NEW YORK POST New York, New York April 28, 1964  CONSUMER SWINDLES—vit       “Stop smoking in only three days, No will power or self control necessary. Proved effective beyond a question in 100 pér cent of smokers tested.  “Don't confuse this offer with plans, systems, books, methods, ete., for these remedies require that you have enough: self-control. to stop smok- ing.”  All you do, the ad says, fs take one “Formula X22" pill following each meal. After only: three days, your nervous system is “fooled” into be- Heving you are smoking your favorite. cigaret, cigar or pipe.  This sort of promotion has been mushrooming all over the U. S. since the Surgeon. General's re- port on smoking and cancer was released early in 1964. Since. January, Better Business Bureaus throughout the ‘country have been flooded with inquiries about dozens of “new” anti-smoking pills and lozenges, mouthwashes and chewing gums, stop-smoking plans and programs costing up to $40 and more for “the cure.”  Fanciful claims by manufacturers. for their products and programs include “miracle ingredi- ents” supposed to be “99 per cent effective’ and to “force you to quit whether you want to or not.” New commercial “tobacco guidance centers” with lofty-sounding names have sprung up from coast to coast—only a few of. them under competent medical supervision,  * * *  Millions of us are paying millions of dollars for products we hope will rid us painlessly of the cigaret habit.  We are gulping sugar pills and concoctions of ordinary spice such as ginger, Heorice, clove, cori- ander—as well as pharmaceutical preparations— to stamp out the cigaret craving.  We are. taking up fake cigarets—dubbed “smokes” or “adult pacifiers’ which contain such non-nicotinie ingredients as metho} srystals,     cabbage, lettuce or just flavored cigaret paper— to keep our nervous hands busy and permit us to “smoke without fear.”  We are falling for suggestive “stop smoking” phonograph records, recently the subject. of in- vestigation by the U.S. Post Office.  : We are enrolling in a wide variety of so-called “positive thinking” programs, even hypnosis, to spirit us away fromi tobacco. We are devouring no-smoke tablets. and how-to-stop-smoking pam-  phlets. % x *  Just what is the value of these pills and pro- motions? What can and can't they do? From the National Better Business Bureau’s Dr. Irving Ladimer, here are a few straight answers:  Despite the welter of new labels, there are no really “pew” substances on the market te help us stop smoking. Old ones simply have heen dressed up or combined to appear new,  The three standard types of anti-smoking medications now available are the nicotine sub- stitute (lobeline sulfate), which alleviates cigaret craving; substances which make smoking taste unpleasant (silver nitrate), and local anesthetics (benzocaine) which numb the mouth and reduce desire for.the puffing part of the smoking ritual.  Many- of these products do, in fact, help you .  quit smoking temporarily. But none does the job permanently. None works without a generous dose of will power on your part. Most are harm less, but a few cases of nausea, stomach -pain and loss of appetitite have been reported as. side- effects.

America’s proud veterans, whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch o which to base thelr dignity. It is inherent.  1  Recently, you received a letter from Representatives Wise and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions jincluded in H.R. 3192.

And these same ill effects can happen to  Consider those who must endure catheters in the es or  non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke.  The smoking provisions are the antithesis of good {health practices. smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. | Let me  get. the record straight on a few issues raised by the — congressmen:  ° Only one of four veterans smoke. We provide gutdoor smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Long term and chronic care patients can still purchase tobagco from VA canteens with medioal approval of their physicians. We have instituted smoking owho wie  programs to assist patients and employees who |wish to stop snoking.  °o The veteran who chooses to smoke does so of his own accord. VA's policy establishes medical center environments that encourage non-smoking behavior, particularly among people who already have major health problems which are aggravated by smoking, and protects those who do not smoke and who can be damaged by exposure to others’ snoke.  | | \ | | I     p16 vS2ts __label__Letter

ao a ir 5-273     INTEROFFICE MEMORARDUY  SUBJECT: INVENTION DISCLOSURE DATE: November 26, 1984  TO: Mr. G. M. Myers FROM: James L-. Resce  Extended Puff Count, Lower CO Delivery And Improved Conductive  Heat Transfer In TGA Models Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally Conductive Aluminum “Fingers”  Summary     The conduction--of heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA model back to the substrate (and tobacco) via an aluminun macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum “fingers” which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend the length of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer serves to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering its combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is consumed at a slower rate, and (2) the production of CO via carbonaceous reduction of CO, is decreased because of the lower temperature maintained in the burning coal.  Background  Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum macrocapsule. The fuel source is generally inserted only 1 or 2 mm inside the macrocapsule. The heat must travel from the burning fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the 1 to 2 mm interface to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the substrate, sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, a new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where  the fuel source is inserted into the capsule but also along these  92% $6595 __label__Letter

Several good points were made for improving the list:  Clarify ST (short term) and LT (long term)  Place the date on the list Update in time to have a newly revised list for each meeting  Number the pages.  The group felt that several areas not presently involved should receive copies of the list - Leaf Buying, Leaf Processing, and Facilities Development, for example. Copying the Leaf and Blends Subcommittee membere will be a big help in getting proper distribution.  Actions required in maintaining the project list are:  1. Corrections/changes need to be sent to Harold Threatt by March 14, 2. Latest corrected project list to be sent to committee members by  March 21. 3. Committee members should come prepared to address any errors at March 28 meeting.  Ill, "Maker" Projects From Manufacturing Engineering  Don Lamonds attended the meeting for the first time. The committee felt that it would be good to include projects in Manufacturing Engineering having to do with maker improvements. Don will provide these for addition to the list. His projects are mainly quality related, but they fit the criterion because of the reduction in the number of rejects, etc.        $9909 etEezs __label__Letter

Total 9 packs out of one carton were collected from that retailer.  A few month ago, there was an incident on the news that some forgery tobacco (JT brand) which illegally imported from China were found by consumer who bought cigarettes from a retailer. Since them, consumer as well as retailer are quite nervous about the product.  We believe that this is isolated incident as no other complaints are reported. However, please kindly inspect the sample and answer to the following questions.  1. Is it a genuine PM products? 2. If yes, which region was it suppose to be exported? 3. Is there any possibility that it can be misplaced in the Japan Domestic products?  One sample pack is being sent to you via TNT AWB# 228750764 for your inspection and the remaining 8 packs are being sent to you under JPQ# 39146 by BPC.  Your early reply would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.  Best regards,  Kayoko Sonoda  Import Administration & Logistics Philip Morris K.K. 81-3-3509-7353 (Tel) §1-3-3506-7737 (Fax)  a9e06Z91802 __label__Email

RCN BY: RUIKT GOVT. RELATIONS 2 4e E-92 FTE OGPM oe 236 568: ~  -~  wee we  ta re re  f  Response to State Attorneys General  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. July 1, 1992  Key Points:  Q  Dr. DiFranza, a principal author of the JAMA studies, has said, “None of these studies were designed to show that these Camel ade increased smoking among kids.*  Joe Camel and Mickey Mouse were not equally recognized in the total study.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza has admitted to bias and research manipulation in his work that purports Camel hag 32% of youth smokers.  Youth smoking is on the decline in the U.S., while youth disapprovabeof smoking is increasing. -  Recognition of advertising does not translate drito usage or changed attitudes about smoking.  The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that  teen smoking can be reduced by as much as 50% through compliance with existing minimumeage laws.  Background facts:  The statement Joe Camel is as well recognized as Mickey Mouse 4s one of the most incorrect headlines in this controvarsy. The article shows that 91.7% of the 229 kids in the study recognized Mickey Mouse as the Disney logo, 51.1% recognized Joe Camel as a cigarette illustration -- a  40-point gap. The 23 6-year-olds in the study came closer to recognizing the two equally, but 23 kida in one school - are in no way representative of the entire U.S., and the ~ flawed methodology of the survey affected this result. Also, recognition does not change the negative recognition kids have about smoking.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza, the principal author of the article on Canel's share of the youth market, has admitted to the press that there is bias and manipulation in his research on Camel. The purpose of his work, ha says, was to "give us a couple of smoking guns to bring to the media." He has acknowledged that, "None of thease studies were designed to show that these Camel ada increased smoking among kida." He outlined the final article more than a year before its publication, writing a research colleague, "There, the paper 6 ail ready. Now all we need ia some data."  LOC H2STS __label__Report

Isl  Powell \darus é+ Rinehart  November 2, 1990  MEMORANDUM  TO: Martin Gleason Susan Stuntz  FROM: Powell Adams & Rinehart Savarese and Associates  SUBJECT: LMC State Tax Strategy  This document will outline a Labor Management Committee state tax strategy for the remainder of 1990 and 1991. The strategy is based upon the information provided us in the October 1990 "Cigarette Excise Legislation Priority 1 States" document.  Resources  In order to shape the state excise tax debate and influence its outcome, the LMC will utilize and access existing resources as well as develop new contacts where possible. Among the resources available to the Committee are:  « LMC member unions  » non-LMC labor organizations with which the Committee has working relationships  « LMC state labor consultants  « Citizens for Tax Justice  « fair tax/citizen action groups which the Committee supports  A Pair Tax Message  In virtually each state, it will be essential to frame the debate as one of fair versus unfair tax policy. By expanding the discussion beyond cigarette excise taxes, the Committee will be able to access more of its resources and the program stands a greater chance of success.  In order to achieve this goal, the Committee will look to the development or update of tax studies and reports, such as those  TNWL 0049688 __label__Memo

Cigarette burn time may prove to be a useful estimator for human nicotine intake. The study confirms the correlation of machine derived yields to decreased cigarette burn time for research cigarettes. The study also provides useful data on yields of nicotine, tar, water, and CO from 27 different puffing regimens, including  1 __label__Email

Standard product testing methodology is judged inappropriate due to the product's unique form and the necessity to maintain Project security. Consequently, new test procedures have been established to assist R&D's development efforts and to assess product, per formance prior to market introduction. These procedures will be validated (and evaluative measures calibrated) utilizing conventional products prior to the first round of SPA product testing. A "traditional" action standard for "blind" product performance cannot be set because of  product uniqueness (form and benefit) and the limitations  imposed by security requirements.  Product development efforts will concentrate on the non-menthol style since capacity constraints will probably preclude simultaneous introduction of a menthol version.  However, to the extent feasible, menthol development will  parallel the non-menthol product.  8699 LOS0S __label__Report

Savoca FROM: T. A. Perfetti  BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM     o Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening, in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables.  CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM  o FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models  Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have  been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for the following smoker groups testing RJR products:  FF competitive smokers  FF franchise smokers FFLT competitive smokers  FFLT franchise smokers  o0o000  The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented  at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.  o FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models     Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200 additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These  additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been  completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.  o Consumer Test Data Base  Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on 292 CT tests has been catalogued.  © Review of Competitive Brand Test Results  Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into effect as of September, 1984.     6SLb 680g __label__Letter

INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE       PED        boop s ance! ws  ce Nt o4  a3 3  AF “ “Tk ONLY No “258 By September 14, 1988  pS » 3 tye mar MR. R. A. KAMPE tay  Re: Germany ~— Tax Classification  It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report  from the Customs Laboratory to the MOF.  In a meeting this morning with three MOF officials, W. Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and were of the opinion that SPA’s characteristics were most similar to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the MOF to classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a  cigarette tax rate.  It was stated at the meeting that this report was preliminary and is not binding on the MOF. However, W. Dembach did not see any indication that the MOF would rule  differently.  The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under ~ Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance, Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich (the official directly in charge of RJR’s request). Absent from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s  superior and has been an advocate of RJR‘s position. Wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a  major factor in the MOF’s decision.  Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He went on to say that the political issues of SPA’s investment value and social benefits were of no concern to the MOF in its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfried believes that Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to  recommend a cigarette tax rate.  Nn °o 0) N ws @ ® h w __label__Letter
ES SE SE STS  2 a ee  MORE     Brand Positioning Statement  How Consumers View The Brand     The MORE Brand, which offers various color, length,  and slimness configurations, is viewed as different  from all other brands of cigarettes. Importantly, smokers are more familiar with MORE 120's than with  MORE Lights 100's, so that perceptions of MORE 120's drive the image of the total Brand. The distinctive color and the long, slim shape (primarily MORE 120's)  are sufficiently distinctive to impart a specific personality to the MORE smoker. Smokers of the brand  are viewed as possessing a strong measure of independence and strength of character, characteristics of people who would smoke so unique a product. They are seen as primarily women, who are self-assured, mature, confident, sophisticated, and stylish. While some smokers view the MORE user as representing the extremes of these character-  istics, the MORE smoker is nonetheless seen as possessing a multi-faceted personality.  By contrast, the users of MORE's primary competition, Virginia Slims, are viewed as having a much more shallow personality. Smokers of Virginia Slims are perceived as exclusively women who are overtly feminine, clothes- conscious, and somewhat immature. While Virginia Slims' perceptions are consistent with its positioning as a brand for women, consumers do not perceive Virginia Slims as strongly projecting personality traits which help to define the kind of women who smoke the brand.  From the standpoint of product perceptions, the majority of smokers are familiar with the unique appearance of MORE 120's (long, slim, dark brown); however, low levels of awareness exist with regard to MORE Lights 100's more moderate appearance (beige, 100mm, slender). In addition, because of its length and slow burn rate, MORE 120's is also perceived as having a measure of value not inherent in shorter cigarettes.  How We Want Consumers To View The Brand     MORE should be perceived by smokers as a brand family of distinctive cigarettes that is smoked by women who are charismatic, sophisticated, and feminine, and who ,possess presence and personality that women admire and desire to emulate. Her presence is defined by the expression of  her attitude about herself, her attitude toward others, and her appearance via her clothing statement.  *?  @cnl LLEOS __label__Report

Morrison Brady, Associate Scientific Director,  The Council for Tobacco Research, 633 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y, IOOIL7.  Dear Dr. Brady,  It was a pleasure to. become acquainted with you at the recent FASEB meeting in Atlantic City, and as you suggested at that time, I am forwarding copies of my curriculum vitae and list of publications. .  Some preliminary studies in my laboratory in Australia resulted  in the recent publication-of a paper in Nature entitled " Nicotine, Smoking  and Cortical Inhibition ", a copy of which is enclosed. I hopefully suggest  that this paper may contain some of the most significant suggestions about the  psychotropic actions of nicotine to have been published and further pursuit  of these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of the psychotropic  actions of tobacco smoke. A comparison of the actions of ordinary and  "de-nicotinised" cigarette smoke on neurones in intact and isolated cortical  areas would constitute a logical extension of my preliminary experiments. I shall _ be moving to Winnipeg later this year to head a neuropharmacology research. group,  and should like to pursue these studies as suggested above. At a later stage,  I should envisage a collaborative series of experiments with colleagues in  the Psychology Department. at Winnipeg.  If you consider that a project along these lines entitled "A Comparison of the actions of nicotine and tobacco smoke on single neurones in the central nervous system" would be of interest to the Council ‘for Tobacco Research, I should be happy to submit an application for support.  As mentioned during our recent conversation, I believe that this technique of recording from single neurones with multiple barrel electrodes, with which it is possible to stimulate or inhibit cells chemically, provides a powerful tool for unraveling problems of this nature.

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Souza Cruz will win in a second instance, considering that “manufacturing cigarettes is a legal activity... Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes manufacturing activity even more legitime.” One of the lawyers who has been consulted (Dr. Celso Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US influence”.  An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidénio) questioned “how it could be possible to determine if the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”, and still complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also  provoque heart attacks”.  Only one attorney believes that “sf it could be proven that the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cuz and that his death was really a consequence of the smoking habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a fact”. This same attorney considered, at the other hand, shese proves difficult to be obtained.  Licio Pedro Macsanyi Corporate Affairs Manager  ECEIWE SEP 2.5 097 ROGER G.

PROPOSAL  Several workers have demonstrated the effects of carbon monoxide on myocardial metabolism and coronary blood flow. However, the direct effect of carbon monoxide on the contractility of isolated heart muscle has nob been thoroughly investigated. I propose to conduct a pilot study of this phenomena utilizing a Blink's isolated heart muscle apparatus and a range of carbon monoxide concentrations which will be determined experimentally. On the basis of information obtained from this investigation, further studies would be planned utilizing a working heart apparatus.  Right ventricles removed from laboratory rats would be isolated in a Krebs-Ringers solution, attached to a force transducer and electrically stimulated. After equilibration with 95% 05 - 52% C055 the preparation would be challenged by bubbling various concentrations of CO - O5 - 5% COg through the medium and changes in function compared to the control period noted.  Finally, 95% 09 ~ 5% CQ) would again be bubbled through the medium and  recovery of function assessed.  In addition to being recorded on the Grass recorder, the wave form of the contraction and stimulus pulse will be displayed on and photographed by a Hewlett- Packard Oscilliscope-camera system. In this manner the onset and decline of developed tension, the latency period between stimulus and contraction, and the  resting tension during the pre-C0, the CO and recovery from CO periods will be  compared. The information obtained in this functional analysis would then be used as the basis for a more detailed study of the biochemical and electrolyte changes  produced in cardiac muscle as a result of CO exposure.     50260322 __label__Scientific

_—a 3970 Association of Profilin with Filament-free Regions of  Human Leukocyte and Platelet Membranes and Reversible Membrane Binding during Platelet Activation  John H. Hartwig,** Kristen A. Chambers,* Karen L. Hopcia,* and David J.

Profilin is a conserved, widely distributed actin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin monomers in a high affinity profilactin complex. In vitro, the complex is dissociated in response to treat- ment with the polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylino- sitol monophosphate, and phosphatidylinosito) 4,5- bisphosphate. Here, we demonstrate the ultrastructural  ROFILIN is a 12-15-kD cytoplasmic actin monomer P binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson ¢1 al., 1976: Magdolen et al., 1988; Reichstein and Korn, 1979). Mammalian profilin occurs as a single isotype (Ampe et al., 1988; Kwiatkowski and Bruns, 1988) and interacts with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment into actin filaments. In vitro, the affinity of mammalian spleen profilin for skeletal muscle actin monomer is relatively tow. Ks = 1-50 pM (Markey et al., 1982; Nishida, 19853, is higher for nonmuscle actin, K, = 10-400 nM (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988), whereas profilin and actin can be puri- fied as a high affinity, K, = 1-10 nM, profilactin complex cells (Blikstad et al., 1980; Carlsson et al., 1976; Hanis and Weeds, 1978; Malm, 1984; Markey et al... 1978). The factor(s) responsible for the high affinity profilactin complex have not been identified (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988). The transien) appearance of the high affinity compiles before and/or during platelet activation (Lind ct al., 1987, Markey et al., 1981) suggests that some mechanism exists in- side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing and Lindberg (1985) have demonsteated that the high affinity complex can be dissociated by treatment with the polyphos- Phoinositides, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP).' and phosphatidylinosito! 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) in vitro. More recently, human platelet profilin has been shown to bind PIP and PIP, reconstituted into vesicles in vitro (Lass- ing and Lindberg, 1988; Goldschmidt-Clermont, P.. J. Bal- dassare, and T.

In both cell types, a significant fraction of profilin is found associated with regions of cell membrane devoid of actin filaments and other discern- ible structures. After platelet activation, the membrane association of profilin reversibly increases. This study represents the first direct evidence for an interaction between profilin and phospholipids in vivo.  notan interaction between phosphoinositides and profilin oc- curs in vivo and whether this interaction regulates the transi- tion between the high and tow affinity states of the profilactin complex.  PIP and PIP; consist of an acidic, phosphorylated inositol side group connected to a glycero! backbone to which two long hydrophobic acy! chains are attached. They are. there- fore, likely to reside in cellular membrane compartments, and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman, 1975; Maucoet al., 1987). The presence of rnultip!e distinct meta- bolic pools of PIP and PIP; in erythrocytes and platelets (Billah and Lapetina, 1982; King et al., 1987). suggests. moreover, that some PIP and PIP; are sequestered in the plasma (and perhaps othe intracellular) membrane(s). pos- sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and Marchesi, 1985: Sheetz et al., £982).  In support of an intracellular interaction between profilin and membrane-bound PIP and PIP;, here we provide direct morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por- tion of cellular profilin with membranes in both intact human platelets and 'Wakocytes.

Dear Honorable Bilirakis:  The California Beverage Merchants Association, representing over 3,000 mom and pop liquor and convenience store owners in California, has been pleased to promote the We Card program to it’s members for over a year. We have publicized the program through our newsletters, distributed materials in our membership kits, and championed the We Card Kits at membership meetings.  We believe that this program is an important tool for our members to use in  training their staff in responsible retailing, and have had very positive feedback from them.  As a member of the Coalition for Responsible Tobacco Retailing, we have helped to set up and promote training for members and non-members alike,  including planning an aggressive program of training for California retailers in April, May and June of this year.  We Card has significantly helped our members and their employees in lowering the incidents of sales to minors, and we are pleased to be a part of this important  effort.  Sincerely,     Judith L.

Regarding the second portion (alking about rate of absorption), this comes from our answer to Markey, with references, plus a direct response to the Pankow claims. Aerosols are not mentioned; vapor phase is. The inclusion of a discussion about rate is necessary only if the audience receiving this is sophisticated enough to understand the issues. Certainly, we do rot want to provide a complex answer which confuses folks, when a simply one would work.  << File: Markey_Dempsey_references_draft.doc >>  VOECEZTPELO™ __label__Email

The print- [ed version declared only two dogs to have cancer signs and these, “microscopic.” | According to Kloepfer, this experiment cost government and private sources $750,000. ; ‘The leading source of funds for lresearch on smoking and health, he said, is the tobacco industry itself, to the tune of about $4% million this year,  has pre-judged cigaret smok- ing as a lung cancer cause and federal regulatory agencies have “made the science fit the pre-determined policies.”  Since smoking-causes-can- cer'is taken as revealed truth, negative evidence tends to be disregarded, the tobacco itr dustry says.

Key findings include:  » "Marlboro Country" offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize ihe brand's image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.  * The concept of “The Mariboro Foundation" which would purchase open jand for  preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company's motives which made any retail tie-in suspect.  * The "Marlboro Adventure Team" concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater potential for promotional programs but was more limited in its imagery. While some men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat  intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more strenuous “Adventures.”  « Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform "heroic" clean-ups and  respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong  appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous “good deeds."  ec: D. Beran A. Burke E. Gee N. Lund A. Macrae J. Mullen-Sampson S. Piskor M.

Reynolds Tobacco Co. Bowman-Gray Technical Center Reynolds Blvd.  Winston-Salem, NC 27105  Dear Mike,  Considering the time I am presently spending on the project and the infrequency at which we discuss my activities, I thought it was time to write a short note summarizing my efforts. I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities.  Summary of Activities  SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS -- Priority #1  Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering. Oxide additives such as Na» and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

aa  t  .  RJR R&D Statistical Support  InterOffice Memorandum  SUBJECT: Visible Sidestream Smoke Measurement DATE: January 24, 1985  TO: Joe Inman FROM: Michael J. Morton  Brand R&D  INTRODUCTION  Sidestream smoke measurements were taken on 52 products: 11 prototype products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurements were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures reported were visible absorbance values. Each number reported is the  average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the sidestream smoke measures. Forty-five products were measured on one device  and the remaining 7 were measured on the other. Some products, a monitor product and NOW 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in  the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance.  The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the ll prototype products give off less visible sidestream smoke than all of the 41 commer- cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurement devices and the visible sidestream smoke values for all products in the  study were compared.  I will first deseribe the results of a comparison between the two measure- ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that was made among the 52 products.  DEVICE COMPARISON  An analysis of variance on the two measurement devices showed an average difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines. (The newer machine read about .0178 lower than the original machine.) That difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two machines, but it is not statistically significant at the standard level. The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigarettes that were used to monitor the machines. The difference was .0185 units for the so-called Monitor product (whieh had an average absorbance of about +75) and -0170 units for NOW 85 (which had an average absorbance of about .54).  In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assum- ing that the two devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis- tinguishable from the other products is not changed according to which as- sumption is made.  8£04 STé6Qag __label__Letter

Sent: Thursday, June 10, 1999 2:56 PM  To: Quinn, Molly; Turo, Bob  Ce: Suter, Mark F.; Owens, Stacey (Madden); Ledebuhr, Paul (Madden); Arbetter, Louis; Sullivan, Rich M.; Nickel, Lynn A; Grace, Brian T.  Subject: RE: 6' and 8' OPM Conversion  As areminder, my recommendation is not to ship OPMs fo retail accounts with a missing panel in the OPM. Our accounts and FSF will be confused and we would have just created total chaos at field level.  Additionally, by placing these items on hold we are confronted with potential rejected orders or confusion as we are just beginning the new allocation process.  The plan we should be looking at is establishing a clear Game Plan & communications to Madden and HUB agents collectively.  Harbor has about 100 message panels in spare paris and plans to ship them to Roselle on Monday (Bulk). Secondly, Bob met with Molly, an prepares a PO for 3,000 + (depending on open orders from Stacey and projected number at TPI ) Message panels for 6’ & 8' OPMs.  Hub recaps to Madden the total number of OPMs they have at each TPI depot that needs to be retrofitted.  A labor force is hired and is sent to Roselle to open aif 6' & 8' opms and remove the clocks and make one good OPM from 2 OPMs (marking each completed OPM with a retrofitted sticker). Additional panels would be shipped from Roselle to TP! depots to have agents retrofit them PRIOR to the day they are to be installed. {Documentation outline to follow)  Once the production of the Panels are completed from Harbor they are shipped to Roselle and the remaining OPMs are made whole using the hired labor force again.  | know this is not the complete process flow, but does present a solution with out upsetting our current process.

COMMENTS ON CANCER INCIDENCE     Epidemiological studies of death rates have claimed that a strong association exists between cigarette smoking and increased risk of death in cancer of (a) lung and bronchus, (b) buccal cavity and pharynx, and (c) prostate.  If one is interested in analyzing the factors that may be involved in the causation of cancer, the incidence of the various types of that disease is more pertinent to analysis than are death rates.  No attempt to cover all epidemiological data on cancer morbidity has been made but the data from reports by two State Departments of Health(1»2) are sufficiently challenging to justify their presentation and to urge further collection, study and analysis of similar data from other sources.  As examples of the claimed increased risk of cigarette smokers  (3)  over non-smokers, Hammond and Horn 1958 give the figures of 31 times for lung cancer, 7 times for buccal cavity cancer, and 1.90 for genito-urinary cancer in white males. Skin cancer is not included as such in their data. There is, however, a "catchall" classification of cancer of "other specific sites," in which skin cancer would be presumably included. In this group, the death rate among cigarette smokers is recorded as being only 0.89 that of non-smokers.  It is fair to state, therefore, that there is no epidemiological evidence of association of cigarette smoking with death from skin cancer.  It has repeatedly been claimed that the generally-admitted increase in cigarette smoking during the past several decades is a significant, if not the main, causative factor in the increased death rate from lung, buccal cavity and  prostatic cancer.  Let us see whether incidence rates of these diseases bear out this  sweeping and basic hypothesis. Data are given in Table 1. __label__Scientific

An Art Director's Viewpoint     Advertising Age, December 23,. 1968  How to Get a Woman's Attention:  By. Stephen Baker  The man-woman situations depicted in the Silva Thins commercials are selling cigarets by. the millions.  In| case you haven’t watched television: lately, these are the commercials which  have slight maso- chistic overtones. There is this long bony character who wears no smile and dark glasses; who seems to be very. preoccupied,. as: it in a daze; who loves his ‘Impossible Cig- arets” so much that he prefers them to even the most beau- tiful girls.  He likes cigarets and hates: women so much, in fact, that he forsakes the latter on deserted highways, ocean liners, cable cars, mountain tops, penthouse apartments and anywhere else if the girls as much as dare: to touch his cigarets. He is the epito- me:of the modern male-on-the-prowl who picks his. women: the way you’d pick. your hors d'oeuvre off a smorgasbord table; they are merely to satisfy his momentary appetite. He is obnoxious, arrogant and quite possibly incurably selfish, but he executes his rude antics with admirable eloquence.  This infuriating oaf may yet.go down in marketing history as one of the most bril- liant. creations of advertising pundits. Ob- viously,. viewers of either sex—and partic- ularly. the young—enjoy vicariously the adventures of the Silva Thins man.  Women (an important market for this cigaret): especially dig the scene of “The Impossible Cigaret.” Psychologically, they seem to fee] right.at home: with the situa- tions. They quite willingly put themselves in the place of the suffering heroine.  Puts Women Where They Want to Be  The makers: of this campaign demon- strate a shrewd insight into the emotional make-up of today’s woman.. Using what appears: to be a masculine approach: in their advertising, they: are reaching the very core of: their feminine audience. The hero. in the Silva Thins commercials ap- pears. to be just what the doctor ordered. His: strength lies in his aloofness. Ignoring practically every rule of etiquette, he summarily puts his girlfriend'in her place,.     Stephen Baker  (4)  and exactly where so many women would unconsciously like to:be:  The Silva Thins commercials, bold as they may be in their approach, are an open proclamation to the American pub- lic that it’s: still the male who rules the roost, or should be. Here the: woman is presented with a boyfriend figure who dominates instead of being dominated. While he makes no attempt. to make out with: her—in fact if anything he takes the opposite tack—he establishes a rela- tionship that pleases her feminine instinct.  It will be interesting to watch the sales of Silva Thins continue to climb. The fact that concurrently another cigaret, Virginia Slims, is trying to: reach the female mar- ket. with its “For-Women-Only” cigaret makes things even livelier. Our guess. is that the appeal of Virginia Slims—which claims that its cigaret' is made for women to permit them to assert. their independ- ence at last—will not be as. successful: as that of “The Impossible Cigaret.”  It's easy to change cigarets. It’s not so easy to change the fundamental! psychol- ogy of women, #     Ignore Her  Silva Thins character may go down in marketing history, says Steve Baker.     1002403141 __label__News

Landrigan and Homayoun Kazemi     The New York Academy of Sciences New York, New York 199]  Asbestos Fibers Are Mutagenic After Alk: New Signs of Orthodoxy for a Paradoxical Group of Carcinogens  THOMAS M. FASY  Department of Patholugs Mount Sinai School of Medicine New York, New Yark [0029           been ado  of that lime the prevailing view has been thal asbestos fibers do not have a clear genotoxic potential. Since this view is currently undergoing a remarkable revi- sion, this is # lmely occasion to review the matter.  Many studies of carcinogenesis point to the important role of DNA damage and the subsequent processing of the resulting DNA lesions to yield mutations. '“* Indeed, many carcinogens have been identified as mutagens (and vice versa) and mutagenesis assays have been widely adopted as surrogates for use in screening compounds for carcinogenic activity," Nonetheless, there is a growing recogni- tion that the process of carcinogenesis involves more than a series of mutations accumulating in critical genes and that nongenotoxic mechanisms also play an important though poorly understood role in expanding the size of initiated clones and by enhancing the effectiveness of genotoxic carcinogens in other ways.  The situation with asbestos fibers is far from clear. Although there is general agreement about the ability of asbestos fibers to induce aneuploidy “and to cause chromosome breaks and other chromosomal aberrations,''- there is dis- agreement between authors who report that asbestos fibers can increase the fre- quency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), which are considered as a manifes- tation of DNA damage.’*!¥ and uhose who report that ashestos fibers are not able to increase the level af SCEs in treated cells in culture,!!??? Finally, numerous investigators have examined the ability of asbestos fibers to damage DNA or to induce mutations in mammalian cell specific-locus assays, and they report that asbestos fibers have little? or no ability! 3"*-* to cause mutations tn these tests. ‘Taken together, these results have led many to the conciusion thal asbestos fibers are most unorthodox and paradoxical carcinogens and that they may act through mechanisms different from those employed by more familiar carcinogens, such as electrophilic chemicals, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet Hehe  A large part of the controversy surrounding the genotoxicity and the muta- genicity of asbestos is semantic in nature. A mulation is commonly defined as a heritable chanye in the genome .** Therefore, the loss or gain of an entire chromo- some is quite properly regarded as a mutalion, Indeed, since monosomies oF trisomies represent the loss or gain of thousands of genes, they must be consid- ered as enormous mutations. In this regard, it is useful to recall that some of the mutants studied by DeVries (who introduced the term and the concept of muta-  271                                                50523644 __label__Scientific

APR-11-1994 11:51 FROM CandB WASH DC 2026626291 TO P.a2  ONFIDENTIAL  March 22, 1994 MEMORANDUM  Re: — Ingredients Identified by HHS as Used in the  Manufacture of Cigarettes but not Approved  for Use i 1. Ammonia -- Ammonia is used as a processing aid in the production of cigarettes. Greater than 95 percent of the ammonia is recovered for reuse. Only trace levels remain in the finished cigarette. Due to its low boiling point, residual ammonia does not pyrolyze. Ammonia is a natural constituent of tobacco. Several ammonia-containing compounds are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by EDA for use in food, including ammonia hydroxide, mono and dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium biocarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium chloride (1 C.F.R. §§ 184.1135, 184.1137, 184.1138, 184.1139, 184.1141, 184.1143). Ammonia compounds are approved for use in tobacco by the Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (the Hunter Committee) in the United Kingdom. . Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance that is produced endogenously by humans at levels far in excess of that delivered in the smoke of a cigarette. Environmental regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to the use, disposal and transportation of significant quantities of ammonia have no bearing on the appropriateness of its use in cigarette manufacture. The Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) workplace exposure limit for ammonia greatly exceeds any leveis  to which smokers would be exposed.  2ILSS26B __label__Memo

‘ March 5, 1991  MEMORANDUM  MAR 11 1991  TO: Dr. James F. Glenn CC: HCM RFG  FROM: Hilda and Leonard Zahn  SUBJECT: International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, Toronto, Canada, July 29-Aug 3, 1991  A speaker at the opening session said that in seeking to con- serve energy in recent years, “we have created a monster." The monster has several faces: medical problems, building problems (which have expanded beyond the "sick building syndrome" of com- mercial buildings to include residential homes and even apart- ments), and social, economic and political problems.  Other aspects are involved as well. Research into indoor air quality (IAQ) has grown at a tremendous rate since the first in- ternational meeting on the subject was held in 1978. Until re- cently, scientific attention had been focused chiefly on outdoor air quality;-.now, however, there is a new science -- indoor air chemistry -- with more funds and more investigators, especially in the industrialized nations. There also is a surprising amount of work going on in less-developed countries, much of it in col- laboration with western researchers.  There is more concern about IAQ because most people spend about 80-90% of their time indoors during their lives, and tight- ened structures generate and retain more harmful or potentially harmful organisms, agents, gases, odors, and particulates. The list contains hundreds of items, some of them produced naturally by the human organism.  The overall situation is compounded by the fact that the com- plex actions of- many indoor substances as well as the interac- tions between them are presently little understood. The immense amount of variability of human reactions to agents indoor adds to the complexity of trying to determine what factor (s) may create a risk and who is at risk upon exposure.  Scientists are not always helpful with data that often seem to be a bit far out. For example, taking a shower subjects everyone to inhalation or dermal absorption of a number of volatile organ- ic compounds (VOC) in the water. Many of these chemicals have been shown to be harmful to health.  It seems valid to say that people in the developed countries generally are not adversely affected by all the putatively harm- ful substances they encounter every day while they are indoors.  It is equally valid to say that nobody really can say what are @  the long-term effects of many of the things floating in the in- oS  door air. oO  °  °  a  eonard PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL ° ahn  and Associates, Inc. 13 LINCOLN ROAD «P.O.

- Attachment II  Pros and Cons of Group Blending at RJR Stemmeries as Assessed by Leaf Program  T. Je Porter, vr. = 2/16/89 Pros  i. Market and grade mixing in staging areas prior to stemming will yield a consistent group prior to  processing.  2. with multiple in-feeding of farm bales/prize room tersa bales, there will be good grade/market/bale mixing.  3. Group vs. grade runs will result in longer stemming runs with fewer changeovers. strip particle size should improve and moisture and stem content should be in  better control.  4. With fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for blending, stemmery groups will have to be run in statistical process control for nicotine.  5. Blending bulkers will be used for blending, not simply for conveying tobacco.  6. Fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units will result in better utilization of storage space and simplified retrieval for blending.  7. Storage remnants will be reduced.  8. Group blending at the stemmeries lends itself to whole container blending at primaries.  9. Blend modeling will be simplified with fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for use.     1. Increased manpower and larger staging areas will be required. More time and effort will have to be devoted  to planning/executing required staging.  2. Multiple in-feeding units will have to be purchased and installed.  3. Group market/grade/bale staging may be by-passed if staging is deemed inefficient/inconvenient by stemmery  personnel.  c9TS 9b60S __label__Report

W. ALTON JGNeS CELLSCIERCe CENTER  Leonard FE. Benade, Ph.D. Grant #1719  Description: Dr. Benade proposes to isolate and characterize a gene which suppresses the action of the oncogene Kirsten RAS. He will do this by first isolating human cells, HOS, with two copies of RAS so that mutants which lose oncogenecity will not be due to loss of RAS. He will then look for revertants which no longer express the transformed phenotype after mutagenesis. He will partially select for such cells using oubain. Revertants are more resistant. He will check these revertants for rescuabable virus, inability to grow in agar and inability to produce tumors in nude mice. Such cells will be fused with mouse NIH 3T3 cells which have been transformed with Kirsten sarcoma virus. Hybrids with suppressed oncogenecity will be selected with oubain. Since human chromo- somes are preferentially lost in mouse-human hybrids, the suppressed cells should with time have Tess and less human DNA. Human DNA will be isolated from such cells, using alu sequences as a probe. This DNA will be used to transfect Kirsten transformed mouse cells and suppressed cells will be selected with oubain. Dr. Benade expects to eventually clone the suppressor gene.  Critique: The idea is a good one and the isolation of a gene which sup-. presses an oncogene will add greatly to our understanding of carcinogenesis. He has a very good publication record. Overlap with pending NIH application should be examined.  Recommendation: Approval - Merit A.  Ae H, Sato, oz por  50244186 __label__Report

Box 1556  Little Rock, AR 72203  Dear Maurice,  The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S. Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation would affect just about everyplace except one’s home.  The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact. While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your members.  It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As lam certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.  Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.     TI1632-1601 __label__Letter
July 25, 1995  To: G. C. Pennell ec: Jim Helm Doug Shouse  From: Michael Corcoran Michelle Soyars Kathryn Noxon  Subject: Project Symphony Meeting  As we are postponing our Symphony meeting tomorrow, I wanted you to be aware of a couple of issues that, in order to keep the ball rolling, we may want to address prior to next Monday. Here is one item we wanted to discuss:  e Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan.  I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with Hogshead. H.J. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday.  As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. J. were going to propose that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings display, alongside Doral. They would not benefit from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success.  According to R.P., I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as another footprint.  At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and switch it out with existing RJR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a month instead of Doral, and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc.  e That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do, i.e. full partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock more conventional approach.  We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart. I just wanted you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation.  uw e ib H aa a N © Ww __label__Letter

Molecular characterization of the signal for radiation-inducible genes and the isolation of novel radiation-inducible genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae:  Michael Fasullo, Ph.D. Loyola University  Specific Aims:  Damage-inducible (DIN) genes have been cloned and characterized from many organisims, including yeast, bacteria, and man. Many of these genes are induced by a variety of DNA damaging agents that inflict a diverse spectrum of DNA lesions, including base pair damage, cross-links, bulky adducts, and singie- and double-strand breaks. These DNA damaging agents include chemicals that cause oxidative damage via the formation of free radicals, similar to those found in tobacco smoke. The diversity of DNA lesions caused by free radicals provokes the question of whether all these lesions can serve as the primary signal for damage-induction or whether these lesions are processed to a common signal that triggers the induction of DIN genes. The aim of this project is to focus specifically at ionizing radiation as an agent that induces DIN genes in yeast, to elucidate the genetic pathway by which a single double-strand break may serve as a signal for the induction of such genes, and to isolate novel radiation-inducible genes that may be triggered directly by the presence of DNA double-strand breaks. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been chosen for these experiments becuase many genes involved in the repair of radiation damage are well defined and the molecular biology and genetics to address the phenotypes of mutated genes is well advanced. In addition, roughly 1% of the yeast genome is speculated to encode damage-inducible genes (Ruby and Szostak, 1985), only a few yeast genes have been characterized as damage-inducible, and previous attempts to isolate DIN genes have not utilized ionizing radiation as the DNA damaging agent-  Significance:  Human genes that are induced by ionizing radiation include TNFa, p53 , protein kinase C, IL-1, collagenase and yadd45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). These and other characterized genes represent a subset of a theoretically much larger set of genes (for review see Fornace, 1992). Although the functional significance of the DIN genes has yet to be explained, recent evidence has found that failure to induce gadd45 is correlated with radiosensitivity in patients afflicted with Ataxia telangiectasia, and such patients have a higher incidence of cancer, especially lymphomas. The induction of these genes by ionizing radiation and free radicals may occur by a variety of signal transducing mechanisms. Oxidative damage to membranes may trigger the expression of protein kinase C which phophorylates transcription factors, such as jun, that in turn induce the expression of such genes (Hallahan et al., 1991), although this may not be the mechanism of the induction of gadd45. Alternatively, DNA damage may be the primary signal for the induction of damage- inducible genes. This is suggested by the observation that cell lines that are defective in damage repair have higher levels of the expression of particular damage-inducible genes (Herrlich et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the signal transduction mechanism which is provoked by a DNA lesion is poorly understood.  Elucidation of the pathway by which radiation-induced DNA lesions directly stimulate DIN genes may be better addressed in yeast. This proposal is divided into the following sections. First, elucidation of the mechanism by which a single double-strand break can  l  50628622 __label__Scientific
INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  mw  To: ODr. G. R. DiMarco May 8, 1984 From: M. Stowe  Subject: R&D and PT&D Projects on Specially Processed Tobaccos  Drs. Bernasek, Dickerson, and I have discussed the type of R&D work which we feel should. be conducted as an extention of the MaD Project. We recommend that work be undertaken in  R&D to 1) confirm the effect of this type of tobacco processing on smoking characteristics, and 2) determine which process(es) RJR should develop. An outline of the project work and staffing which we recommend for 1984 is attached.  Since further evaluation of blends ‘depends on the availability of adequate quantities of the specially) processed tobaccos, an attempt was made in late April to produce cast reconstituted sheet at TMCI, Inc. The sample arrived in R&D on Monday. If the smoking characteristics of this material are judged to be acceptable (or close enough to lead us to believe acceptable material can be made at TMCTY), then the R&D program outlined on the attached document should be feasible for 1984. If this is not the case, the timetable will be lengthened cansiderably. ,  Recommended staffing for the R&D project is shown on the project outline. The appropriate Managers have been contacted to determine that temporary assignment of the staff indicated to this project is possible if you approve this commitment of R&D manpower. Because his time is heavily committed to work on TGA, Dr. Casey is not included in the project staffing. Dr. Dickerson had indicated that a limited amount of his time would be available for consultation, and I will ask Dr. Lloyd if such an arrangement will still be possible.  A major objective for PT&D in 1984 should be to establish facilities for the production of experimental quantities of cast reconstituted sheet. This along with the planned upgrading of the G7 Pilot Plant will put us in a position to conduct process research on either ‘or both of these types of - reconstituted sheet. Without such facilities, it will not be possible to conduct research of :any quality on the  type of treatments needed. A memorandum is attached which outlines the work which PT&D will conduct in support of this  project.  Please let me know when you would like to discuss this project.  . an UK ye He XC: Dr. E.

Philip Morris Cos. {nc., which owns the Hpeaccanrompaty that makes best-selling  ‘ariboro and other cigarettes, publicly ac- knowledged with the debut of its corporate Internet site Wednesday that smokers face serious health risks.  The declarations by Philip Morris follow years in which it fiercely argued with gav- ernment and medical authorities about the risks of smoking.  President Clinton said Philip Morris’ ac- knowledgment that tobacco Isn't safe “comes far too iate but still we must all wel- come it, It can be the beginning of clearing the air.”  “Tt certainly makes clear, as I have said for years, that the lobacco companics should answer for their actions in court,” the president said Wednesday. "They  # See COMPANY/11A ® Continued from 1A  should stop marketing their prod- ucts to children. And certainly they should do much more to reduce . youth smoking.” The Justice Department flied ‘ it against the tobacco companies ¢BBast month seeking to recover bil- lions of doliars in federal health costs for treating sick smokers. \ The states already nave settled with the industry for $248 billion -over 25 years. . . © Philip Morris posted its com- : *zments on smoking’s risks as. it ~~ launched 2 $100 million advertising . Scampaign to remake the compa cp fy's image, which has taken a beat- “ling as smokers, unions and the gov- ermment have sued the tobacco makers for compensation for the health consequences of smoking. “In some ways I recognize this is a public relations effort,” said Da- vid Kessler, the former head of the ‘“tsfederat Food and Drug Adminis- +Ltration, said in an interview. “But it *-certainly sels the stage for regu- lation of tobacco products.”        POGE: 29  San Antonia Express-News  eeosLbeloz  a  =D,  ay  wv __label__News

This does not mean that we  should scrap existing material or go into overtime in order  to accomplish this objective. However, any new units oF currently being prepared for use in newspaper should include  the Warning Statement.  fhe timing for the appearance of the Warning Statement in magazines and out-of-home media is shown on the attached sheet. . The scheduling was agreed to by the Brands as the earliest practical date for use of the Warning Statement in these media.  These timing instructions do not supersede the instructions you have received earlier giving you the final date of compliance, but they are intended to coordinate all brands' scheduling so that the Warning Statement will begin to appear about the same time in all our brand advertising.  Please advise if you have questions regarding this timing.  CHECKING PROCEDURE  ghe Brand Groups and the Agencies have the primary responsibility of insuring that-each unit of advertising has the_necessary Warning Statement—and-the-ftand_N Legend. The Agencies have been provided with the necessary information for compliance and are taking steps internally to insure that all material will have the necessary Warning and T and N Legend. It will be necessary, however, for  the Brands to continue to oversee the Agency on these matters.  _ a D        ooze €£70S __label__Report

COCONINO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH     GEORGE J. GRAHAM Owector  Youth Access to Cigarettes in Flagstaff, AZ  SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION  A recent round of unannounced compliance buys at 83 Flagstaff tobacco retailers and vending machines has shown that minors could @asily buy cigarettes. Compliance buy surveys completed nationwice have documented that about 50-100% of the attempts were successful.  In Flagstaff, fifteen to sixteen year old youths bought cigarettes 61.4% of the time. The percentage jumps to 92% from. vending machines. Over half of the vending machines were in clear sight of employees, nonetheless, minors still bought cigarettes.  Warning signs stating the 18 year old age limit to purchase tobacco products were posted at only 25.9% of locations. Identification was asked of the minors only 33.7% of the time. On two occasions, even after presenting the clerk with underage identification, the clerk still sold the cigarettes to the minor.  Businesses most likely to sell to a minor were, gas/convenience (46.8%), restaurant/bar (100%), and Other which included hotels/motels, and bowling alleys (88.8%). Almost ail in the restaurant/bvar and Other catagory were vending machines.  METHOD  In February, 1994, unannounced inspections (compliance buys) were conducted at almost all Flagstaff tobacco retailers and vending machines. This included 56 lecations where cigarettes can be bought over-the-counter, and 27 vending machines. Although the sample used was not random, nearly all of the tobacco retailers were covered.  Minors ages 15-16 attempted to buy cigarettes at a total of &83 locations. Two minors, or a minor and adult escort (who would walk in after minor to avoid association) entered the tobacco retail outlet or vending machine location. The minor located the Cigarettes, picked a name brand (Marlboro, Camel), brought them to the cashier and attempted purchase. For vending machines they would put the money in and buy the cigarettes. If.the minor was asked their age or for I.D., they were instructed not to lie, and to show their I.D.  After the purchase attempt, the minor filled out a questionnaire that collected objective information based upon their observations  oz the location, situation and experience.

tf  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: 25 September, 1987  From: Barbro Goodman  Subject: CIGARETTES FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH  -  Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical Researcp pe and Cigarette Technology personnel, several cigarette models: were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke compositio The objective for the upcom«ng studies is to investigatf Ene effect of cigarette circumference and Mg(OH)2 wrapper. “érder to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes were made at thre e different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8 mm) each with a Yetandard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156) and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from  the same batch of tqbacco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered configuration. re  s The selected blend was the! current project TRIM blend with standard production components. DBC Brfght, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC and RL 150B was used. It cont ed no stems or expanded tobaccos, so that better looking ultra slim gigarettes could be produced. All samples had the same casing and affercut system.  The Hauni lab max was used for all thré€@"circumferences. Cellulose acetate filters were made with widely varying efficiencies in an effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries,within reasonable levels. The tables attached to this memo give analytical data for each of the models. As can be seen in Table ", the 17 mm configuration gave extremely high RTD’s for nonvefitilated cigarettes. This could have an effect on mainstréam puffing to a greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra slim prototypes typically have RTD!s above 6" water for 45 - 55%  filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for the slim cigarettes.  Tables II and III give the calculated differences in data for each circumference with the commercial and the low sidestream wrappers at standard circumference as controls.  SLLE98PL0E __label__Memo

Spight, Senior Director/Merchandising and Promotion  fom oO-M. Murray, Product Manager L.c. Whiting, Sales Promotion Services Manager  rt APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION: CARLTON ASSAULT W-3 EXPANSION     The following proposal recommends funding an expansion of the CARLTON Assault effort to Section W-3. Total estimated costs are $1,920,000.  BACKGROUND  The CARLTON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion)  focused to create maximum pressure against the retail environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and powerful program designed to build business and capture new share.  The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly developed growth opportunity areas -- success breeds  success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault strategy moves on to another strong area.  Section W-3 is our strongest CARLTON area with a 145 SDI (2.29 share). W-3 represents 6.64% of population and, more importantly, 9.61% of CARLTON sales.  W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future Bold expansion which will provide added S/O support.  CONNECTICUT ASSAULT RESULTS  MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a  positive CARLTON share trend. Due to shipment volatility, we are examining three month moving shares.     970151581  PRODUC]        ED FROM B&W WEB SITE __label__Memo

TRANSFORMATION  Fluorescent trpt transformants were observed following treatment. of wild-type DNA with HNO? (positive control). The B. subtilis assay system is now operational in our hands. |  Experiments were begun to measure the effects of IRI and X6D0AD (AD) whole smoke condensates (WSC's) on the activity of transforming) DNA. Preliminary results showed that both WSC's had no toxic effects on the cell's under the conditions used.  ‘Be = S. Typhimurium MUTATION  1. Liquid Culture: Replicate experiments were performed in which mutant cells were grown for 18-22 hours in the presence of different doses of IRI WSC. The results to date indicate that IRI WSC does not in- duce mutations at a significant level (>2X spontaneous) in either the base sub- stitution mutant (TA 1535) or the frame- shift mutant (TA 1538).?  2. Soft Agar Overlay (Disc. Test): Preliminary results supported the results of liquid  culture experiments- (see above). Neither IRI nor AD WSC was active in producing a  significant number of his* revertants in. the TA 1535 and TA 1538 tester strains.  C74-04164  ¥2Z820Z2202 __label__Scientific

Summary  INTRODUCTION  Ix a previous study! we reporied on the associations between age-specific to1al mortahwy and a vanety of eco nome, heatth-service, and dietary varsables in 18 devel- oped countries. Our conclusion was that, in general, the healih-service factors showed neghgible association with morality, the dietary factors were of hitle amporiance, and the only consistent pattern was 9 negative associ- ation between gross nauonal product (G.N.P.) per capita and mortality. Age-specific total mortality is,  _however, 8 crude measure by which to compare coun-  tries and so we have embarked upon a comparison of parucular diseases.

HKECO 16039 IV. ‘INITIATING VERSUS DEVELOPMENTAL INFLUENCES     General Comments  It is obviously difficult to separate influences on the initiation of cardiovascular diseases and tnose which affect the development of such diseases once they are established.  This is especially true where recognition and classification of the disease occur only after other symptoms exist, as is usually the case.  As might be expected, there is no hard and fast rule or universally consistent clinical opinion on this matter. It is clear that individuals differ in response to smoking and to their deprivation from the habit.  Further research may conceivably indicate that a sufficiently high percentage of those with established degrees of cardiovascular disorders will react so unfavorably to smoking as to justify medical advice on certain courses  of restrictive action. This, however, is properly a matter of relationship between the individual doctor and his patient. The desired situation is one  which will involve es broad and comprehensive knowledge as can possibly be acquired to guide the profession in the light of its clinical experience.  The references appended will present opinions which are based on such experience. They should be considered as being contributory rather than  conclusive and as being selected for purposes of comparison.  The important point is that more refined and sophisticated longitudinal studies of controlled populations of apparently normal individuals are sorely needed. These should aid in refining our recognition of departures from normalcy which represent the earliest evidence of the diseases under study and which, therefore, may be closely connected with their origin.  Similarly, manipulable populations of patients with established early cardiovascular diseases should provide material for more sophisticated clinical studies of factors which may influence the progress and course of  these diseases.  Until such studies are organized and bear fruit we shall have to be content with a type of evidence which leaves doubt as to whether we are dealing with factors which influence origin alone, progressive development  alone, or both.  Ocular, Cerebral and Other Peripheral Circulation  According to Bettman, Fellows, et al., the effect of cigarette smoking on intraocular blood volume in man is net known. ‘They have, therefore,  used animals for experimentation.  If the cigarette was smoked at the normal rate there was no effect. If it was smoked rapidly there was a significant rise in intraocular volume. Denicotinized cigarettes gave generally similar results. __label__Report

Inspiratory pressure generation: comparison of subjects with COPD and age-matched normals  SANFORD LEVINE, MICHAEL GILLEN, PHILIP WEISER, GARY FEISS,  MICHAEL GOLDMAN, AND DAVID HENSON  Pulmonary Disease Section, Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104; and Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19129  Levine, SANFORD, MICHAEL GILLEN, PHILIP WEISER, GARY Feiss, MichakL GOLDMAN, AND Davip HENSON. Inspiratory pressure generation: comparison of subjects with COPD and age- matched normals. J. Appl. Physiol. 65(2): 888-899, 1988.—We continuously monitored esophageal (Pes) and gastric (Pga) pressures and used these measurements in a three-component model to estimate instantaneous diaphragmatic (DIA), inspir- atory accessory muscle (IAM), and postexpiratory recoil (PER) pressures at various times during inspiration. We validated our model both by volume-pressure relationships of the respiratory system (Vrc-Pga and Vab-Pga, where Vre and Vab are the rib cage and abdominal volumes, respectively) as well as electro- myography of the respiratory muscles. Measurements were carried out at rest and during graded treadmill exercise in 11 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal subjects (AMNs). AMNs were 59 + 2 (SE) yr and had a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEVio) of 3.6 + 0.2 liters; COPDs were 66 + 2 yr and had a FEV, of 1.0 + 0.1 liters. We noted the following. At rest, both AMNs and COPDs exhibited an increasing DIA pressure (Ppia) across inspiratory time (T1) at rest. As expired minute ventilation increased with exercise intensity, AMNs continued to maintain this Poi, ramp across inspiration; in contrast, COPDs exhibited higher values of Ppra during the first half of Ti than during the second half. At all intensities of exercise, COPDs exhibited higher IAM and PER pressures than the AMNs.  diaphragmatic mechanics; ventilatory muscle fatigue; treadmill exercise  FOR OVER A CENTURY, previous workers have attempted to evaluate the contribution of different respiratory mus-  cle groups to ventilation at rest and during exercise (4). In 1976, Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) studied thor- acoabdominal volume-pressure changes in normal hu- mans and concluded that at rest the diaphragm was the only importantly active inspiratory muscle. During in- creasing intensities of bicycle exercise, they observed thoracoabdominal volume-pressure changes, which they interpreted as reflecting increased activity of the inspir- atory accessory muscles (IAM) and expiratory muscles. Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) hypothesized that ex- piratory increases in abdominal pressure represented the storage of elastic and gravitational energy in the chest wall at end expiration; at the beginning of the next inspiration, relaxation of the expiratory muscles would release this energy and thereby facilitate inspiratory  888  airflow.  More recently, Dodd, Brancatisano, and Engel (6) utilized thoracoabdominal volume-pressure measure- ments to evaluate the contributions of various ventila- tory muscle groups to inspiration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during bicycle exercise. They hypothesized that postexpiratory recoil (PER) of the abdominal wall resulted in rapid diaphrag- matic descent, outward movement of the rib cage, and decompression of thoracic gas, and pointed out that contraction of the abdominal muscles during expiration tended to preserve diaphragmatic length for the initia- tion of the subsequent inspiration. However, neither Grimby et al. (9) nor Dodd et al. (6) attempted to describe the instantaneous pressures generated by the different ventilatory muscle groups throughout inspiration.  Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14) first introduced esophagea! pressure-gastric pressure (Pes-Pga) relation- ships to infer the contributions of the diaphragm (DIA), IAM, and PER to inspiratory muscle pressure generation by a direct graphic method, and showed that this analytic approach was useful in a qualitative assessment of ven- tilatory muscle coordination during breathing under dif- ferent circumstances. Despite the extensive studies of Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14), these authors did not attempt to quantitate the instantaneous pressures generated by different ventilatory groups throughout in- spiration.  In the present study, we use a three-component model of inspiratory pressure generation to estimate instanta- neous DIA, IAM, and PER pressures at various times during inspiration. We present these estimates for 11 COPD subjects (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal subjects (AMNs) during rest and various intensities of treadmill exercise. We include ventilatory muscle elec- tromyograms (EMGs) as well as the relationships be- tween changes in thoracoabdominal displacements and respiratory pressures (9) to validate the conclusions drawn from our model of inspiratory pressure generation.  METHODS Definition of Terms  Resting point. We define resting point (RP) as the Pes and the Pga at the start of inspiration (i.e., end-expira- tory values of Pes and Pga) during the rest interval  0161-7567/88 $1.50 Copyright © 1988 the American Physiological Society     50655432 __label__Scientific

A detailed report will’ be -  available in late July.  Interviewing was undertaken in twelve northeastern cit4des among 404 menthol smokers and 102 young (18-24 years) Parliament smokers who occasionally smoke menthol cigarettes. The menthol smokers were broken out into the following groups:  o 147 full flavor king size smokers 0 161 flavor low king size smokers o 96 female flavor low 100’s smokers  The following points highlight the topline findings:  ° With the exception of the female 100’s smokers, Parliament Menthol did not appear to generate interest at the concept stage. Specifically, only one in ten of the Parliament and menthol king size smokers stated they would "definitely buy" the brand.  ° However, after trial, "definite" purchase interest levels doubled among both the king size and franchise smokers so that all four smoker groups exhibited similar levels of interest.  cc: D.

Anti-abortion activists concerned with the well- being of fetuses should per- haps start supporting anoth: § ef group of protesters — the opponents of secondhand § smoke.  Roughly one-fourth of 4 American women smoke TOM  while pregnant, and perhaps SJE QFRIED as Many as half of nonsmok-  ing pregnant women are exposed to the smoke of others. Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to the fetus, and medical researchers have document- ed several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo- sure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous abortions, lower birth weights and a higher rate of attention deficit disorder.  Furthermore, a study published this month found a substantial increase in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (commonly known as “crib death”) among infants exposed to smoke before birth.  SIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the United States; more babies between the age of 1 month and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other cause. The causes of crib death have long been mysterious — and in fact, part of the definition of SIDS is that the death is unexplained. But while the  "unknown causes of SIDS aren’t likely to be simple, cigarette smoke seems to be a factor.  Smoking by mothers, fathers or other people in the same room with a baby greatly increases the crib death risk, researchers from the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego, reported last month in the Jour- nal of the American Medical Association.  “The greater the total number of cigarettes the infant was passively exposed to after birth from all adults, the higher the risk of SIDS,” wrote Hillary Sandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.  Furthermore, smoke raises the risk of SIDS even when the exposure comes before birth. When fa- thers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking mother during pregnancy, for example, the risk of infant crib death more than tripled. If the mother smoked during pregnancy, the risk wag even great- er, the researchers found.  Of course, such research represents only an in- dictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not yet a conviction, for a correlation is not proof of a cause-and-effect relationship. Still, other research has begun to show evidence of how nicotine might do direct damage to the developing fetal brain.

Nicotine caused several changes in brain’ac-+ tivity, and for the most part the changes werd the? same in mother rat and babies-to-be.  In the last few days before birth, however, nico- tine induced a change in the fetuses’ suprachiasma- tic nuclei, though not in the mothers’. The change was the switching into sction of a particular gene known as c-fos. Among other things, c-fos plays an important role in the regulation of circadian. |. rhythms — the daily rhythms of the biological’ - clock.

March 4, 1999 Tim (last) TO: T. J. Payne FROM: R. L. Mozingo  SUBJECT: Weekly Status Report - State Government Relations  Cigarette Excise Taxes  A House committee held a hearing on the Governor’s proposal to increase the Maryland cigarette excise tax by $1.00 per pack (36¢-$1.36). A full committee vote on the measure could be taken as early as March 5. Leadership of the House seems to be favoring an increase of 50¢ per pack in 1999 and 50¢ more in 2000.  The New Hampshire Senate Ways and Means Committee passed legislation raising the cigarette tax by 25¢ per pack (37¢-62¢). The full Senate is expected to give the bill a second reading and refer it to the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate is expected to hold the bill in the Finance Committee while the legislature debates other pieces of the education funding legislation.  The 6¢ per pack (21¢-27¢) excise tax bill in New Mexico passed the Senate and has been sent to the House. The Governor stated this week that he would veto any tax increase bill that came across his desk.  In Wyoming, the bill that removes the sales tax exemption from tobacco products passed the Senate.  MSA Legislation  The New Jersey Assembly Health Committee has scheduled hearings on two settlement- related bills - one to set up a Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund and another to require non- participating manufacturers to pay into a reserve fund.  A California Senate bill has been introduced to implement the “renegade” provisions of the MSA. A total of 12 bills have been introduced in the legislature that direct where money from the MSA might go, and four more bills were introduced to begin the battle over tax revenues raised from Proposition 10, the 50¢ per pack ballot initiative that passed in November.  Settlement related bills were also introduced in Connecticut and Vermont.     sees eacels __label__Letter

Ko ollard  MEMORANDUM 7/13/95 TO: M. Borsini FROM: K. Paitakis SUBJECT: Style Special POS Pricing - Texas Test Market  The following is a list of cost estimates for the Vinyl Decal and 3 piece Mobile which we are  considering for the Texas test market. I have also received projected quantities from Sales Planning as listed below.  The costs are as follows:  Item Quantity Cost Per Unit Total Cost 10 1/2" Vinyl Decal 6,600 $7.25 $47,850 3 Piece Mobile 6,000 $5.38 $32,280  The cost per unit listed above is based on a quantity of 2,500. Therefore, the actual cost per unit will probably be slightly lower.  As you are aware, mechanicals for the decal, mobile and dummy pack are currently being developed by Bob DeBlasio. Receipt of the decal and mobile mechanicals are expected by July, 24, 1995.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions!  Kp  ce: A, Sadovnick C. Humphrey C. Lucente j. Tatulli K.

PROJECT SUMMARY: -  Be brief-200 word maximum: (Include Objective, Approach, / . ~ Current Plans and/or . Progress) Analytical methods will be developed to separate the naturally occur- i ring stereoisomer 1-nicotine from d-nicotine. Attempts to. accomplish this { will involve the use of high performance liquid and capillary gas chromato— i . eraphic columns with stationary phases containing optically pure chiral i @ groups. Another approach to be investigated involves the interactions of t nicotine with various optically. pure chiral acids and separations of the re- . sulting diastereomeric ion pairs by liquid chromatography. A less attrac } tive possibility involves chemical modification of nicotine by an efficient | nonstereoselective process to a species which can besconverted to diastereo~ { meric derivatives. The resulting derivatives might be separable by liquid | or gas chromatographic techniques. Once suitable chromatographic methods ! ‘have been developed for the ‘micro-scale analyses of d- and i-nicotine, ‘studies will be initiated to accurately determine the degree of conversion of the natural l-isomer to its enantiomer during the burning of tobacco.  The comparative metabolism of d- and 1-nicotine will also be investigated in rats and mice following administration of the racemic compound. In addi~ tion, methods will ‘be’ developed for preparative-scale chromatographic separ~ ations of the enantiomers of nicotine and nornicotine. :     50168370 __label__Report

The following Conference Report serves only as a top line of the findings.  The 3 sessions on March 11 were comprised of male Marlboro smokers age 18-34. The 3 sessions on March 12 consisted of 1 group of Marlboro smokers, 2 groups of CAMEL smokers. All attendees had attended at least 1 sporting event in the last 18 months. Each group was exposed to 4 CAMEL Brand executions, 4 existing Sports Marketing ads, 9 comps for proposed Sports Marketing advertising, a sports themed Smooth Magazine and 4 CAMEL sports characters. Although the opinions and overall mindset of the groups were diverse, several creative guidelines were established for CAMEL Sports Marketing executions:  * Realism is a key ingredient in all concepts accepted by the groups - the vehicles and the placement of them in the arena must be believable and relevant. (bike flying out of the stadium) In addition, Joe must be in a position that is viewed as being conceivable (wouldn't be on hay bales and other unattainable locations).  Joe should be involved/interact and clearly exhibit interest in the sports depicted (not looking at the action on hay bale execution and the GT sky box comps).  Joe must be relatable, accessible and one of us - yet be "special." He is viewed as a notch ‘ above with the right connections yet not an authority figure or a yuppie suit guy (strong playback on pink jacket, daintily holding pennant rope, holding restricted sawhorse etc.)  6899 T$9Ts  ’. Creative executions should consider the strong opinions elicited regarding coloration | *- and the consumers dissemination process. Hot purples and pinks and upscale clothing and images should trigger a red flag. Each group had very strong and consistent playback regarding Miami Vice look, yuppie clothes, vehicle paint schemes etc.) __label__Report
CYTOVOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES SPECIFIC FOR SELF TUMOR IMMUNOGLOBULIN EXPRESS T CELL RECEPTOR 6 CHAIN  By ANN WRIGHT, JEFFREY E. LEE,’ MICHAEL P. LINK, STEPHEN D. SMITH, WILLIAM CARROLL,! RONALD LEVY,! CAROL CLAYBERGER, anp ALAN M. KRENSKY  From the Departments of Pediatrics, *Surgery, and tMedicine, - Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305  One goal of cancer research is to exploit the exquisite specificity of immune recog- nition to eliminate tumors in vivo. Although their role in immune surveillance of  tumor cells remains unclear, CTL are possible candidates for adoptive immunotherapy. The effectiveness of this therapy depends on CTL recognition of specific tumar an- tigen. Ig on B cell lymphomas is an ideal tumor-specific antigen since it has a vari- able region (idiotype) that is tumor specific (1, 2). We report here that human CTL specific for the idiotype on autologous B cell tumors could be selectively expanded in vitro. The phenotype of these CTL is CD3*,CD4°,CD8~ and they express the  § chain of the TCR. Such CTL could be grown in vitro for the treatment of B cell lymphoma.  Materials and Methods  Celi Lines. ‘Tamor cell lines were established as described (3) fram the primary tumors of three patients with Burkit’s lymphoma. The SUP-B8 cell line was derived from tumor isolated from the bone marrow of a 15-yr-old female with Burkit’s lymphoma with extensive bone marrow involvement (B cell ALL). The patient achieved a complete remission after treatment with chemotherapy but suffered an isolated central nervous system relapse. She received an autologous bone marrow transplant, depleted of malignant cells with anti-B1 mAb, following preparation with total body irradiation and high dose cyclophosphamide. Reeur- rent B cell acute lymphoblastic leukernia was documented 5 wk after uansplanc, and 9 mo after initial diagnosis. Peripheral blood was obtained from the patient at the time of leukemic relapse. The SUP-B12 ccll line was derived from tumor isolated from a 7-yr-old male with Burkitt's lymphoma with extensive bone marrow involvement (B cel! ALL). He was treated with intensive chemotherapy and complete remission was documented ¢ wk after the start of treatment. He received intensive maintenance chemotherapy, which was electively discon- tinued 18 mo later. He remains in continuous complete remission. PBL were obtained from this patient both during and after chemotherapy while in remission. ‘The SUP-BI17 cell line was derived from the malignant ascites fluid from a 3 and 3/12-yr-old male who presented with a primary Burkitt's lymphoma in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were normal and he was designated stage III, Com- plete remission was obtained with chemotherapy, which was electively discontinued after 15  This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant CA-34233, fellowship AI-07290 fram  the ‘Lraining Program in Immunology (to A.

I still need to see how it fits into the overall picture, which I've yet to assemble due to everyone else's delays getting approved budgets to me.  I'd appreciate it if you would both keep this in mind as we go forward in 1996, and if significant projects arise that would throw us over budget, we will need to request more funds. Similarly, if we see that the projects are running under budget, we will have to reassess our needs and should reallocate any unused funds to other line items or projects.  apGlZ7£EL0Z2 __label__Email

One of my earliest studies  was a comparison of dCMP deaminase activity in normal and malignant mammalian tissue (Cancer Res. 23, 454, 1963). Many of my earlier publications involved kinetic studies of various enzymes derived from normal and malignant tissue. In 1967, I (with Drs. E. Borek and P.R. Srinivasan) provided the first demonstration of mammalian DNA methylase (Biochem. 7, 280). In 1967, I joined Dr. Alex Novikoff in the Department of Pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where I continued studies in nucleic acid metabolism in addition to learning electron microscopic techniques. In 1969, I joined the SUNY Health Science Center as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and expanded my research to include experimental cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to my research, I have for the past 21 years been teaching cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy to medical students, house staff and practicing physicians (Continuing Education) at the Medical Center and affiliated hospitals.

The survey template will need to be updated. | am working with the Corporate group on timing for the update but their initial response was a relatively quick turnaround time.  2. The database will need to be updated to capture the new information. This would only take 24-48 hours to complete. In regards to setting a default for Marlboro Mitds to Menthol. At the present time Suppliers do not handle default logic due to data quality concerns. All defaults are dane on the database. The database however, is not able fo handie the default you are requesting. Sf you were to default Mariboro to Milds to Menthol on the database then ail Marlboro responses would be considered Menthol (i.e. the database can not handle combination defaults). This is a change that is being investigated for  Monarch. 04 andy defau ag arlbare Miikks € iF pombe new WA rs Hrd as  / ; it Pe tora» / 3. The data entry suppliers would need to update their programs to allow for the new Value on the’tar level question. | have spoken with Fulfilment about timing, and due to significant programming requests and issues already on the priority list, they would prefer to wait until mid-August to bring this issue up to the Suppliers. Thus, we would not recommend changing the survey until after this point in time.  In regards to your second question concerning the Regular Brand Question. The suppliers are currently set up to capture any extra information given in the Regular Brand quesiion that pertains to questions 2-5 on the current survey. That is, if only the Regular Brand question is asked and an Adult Smoker answers Marlboro Lights, then the data entry supplier captures Marlboro for the brand and populates Lights for the Tar Level. If we split out Lights and Milds then a response of Marlboro Milds to the Regular Brand Question would be captured as Mariboro for the brand,and Milds for the Tar Level.  {n the short term, we could request that a response of Milds be captured as a medium.

a EEE —_— ee     __  DRAF'?-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT~-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT—DRAFT—-DRAFT—-DRAFT  HIGHLIGHTS DATE: April 24, 1990 BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH =  Psychophysiology of Smoking - Integration of analytical chemistry data with EEG, heart rate, task-performance, and mood/feeling rating data from the 1989 EEG study was begun. Subjects were segregated into 3 groups based on  pre- to post-smoking plasma nicotine ‘rise’. Appropriate analyses of Variance are underway.  Drs. Reynolds, Robinson, and Pritchard met discuss a study to determine the optimal structure for DFC (Desire For Cigarette) measurement. Ina subsequent meeting, Drs. Robinson and Pritchard planned the detailed experimental design.  Basic Sensory Research - Evoked brain potentials, respiration, and sensory data were collected from one subject during exposure to nicotine. This session completed collection of required evoked potential data for 6 subjects. Collection of data from subject 5, an in-house volunteer, is all that remains for the completion of this phase of the work.  Mr. Roger Jennings prepared computer files of sensory attribute data on ETS chemicals from recently published reports. Sensory information on chemicals in ETS will be incorporated into a relational database that contains other information on the compounds. The data base will be used to answer end-user questions on specific chemicals or sensory characteristics.  UNIFY database software, currently on the Biobehavioral Division’s SUN computer, was evaluated by Mr. Jennings for use with the ETS data.  Dr. Jim Walker attended the 12th annual meeting of the Association of Chemoreception Sciences. He presented a paper entitled "Effects of Odorants on Respiratory Behavior and Nasal Patency." It was timely, owing to a  great deal of interest by meeting participants in the question of perceived irritation in humans. The following were noted at the meeting: an increase  in research on primate gustatory and olfactory systems, renewed interest in "taste" sensations mediated by the olfactory system, increased representation of manufacturers of fragrances and others who use fragrances to enhance product appeal, increased competition among NIH-funded chemosensory centers, increased interest in the "olfactory deficit" in Alzheimer’ Ss disease, sophisticated use of voltage-sensitive dyes and video- imaging techniques, interest in the measurement of human respiratory behavior, an increase in the number of industrial chemosensory scientists conducting psychophysical studies, an increase in the number of chemosensory scientists in consumer product R&D, and increased interest in odorant-evoked potentials.  Smoke Component Dose - Mr. Davis sought information from Dr. Brian Lawrence and Mr. Brian Smeeton (P&AT) about tea cultivation and the use of nicotine sulfate as a pesticide. Mr. Davis is preparing to survey a number of teas for potential nicotine content. We and others have observed nicotine in teas previously.  Nicotine Receptor Pharmacology - Dr. Eric Fluhler continued to characterize     the effects of nicotine on calcium flux in synaptosomes prepared from adult ~~  rat brain. Results indicate that micromolar concentrations of nicotine Significantly increase intrasynaptosomal concentrations of calcium.

A ITuman PB-PK Model for Simulating Nicotine Uptake from Transdermal Delivery and Cigarette Smoking  Speaker: Dr. J). Donald deBethizy Presentation Time: 45 minutes  Human exposure to nicotine can occur from tobacco use, ETS, diet, gum, nasal spray, or transdermal delivery. A human PBPK model for nicotine and a major nicotine metabolite, cotinine, was developed from a previously published rat PBPK model. A novel forearm compartment was used to describe the blood sampling site in humans.  The model accounted for 20% decrease in nicotine clearance during cigarette smoking. The human model predicts plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine following  intravenous injection, smoking, and transdermal delivery of nicotine. The model 7  suggests that tissue kinetics following transdermal delivery closely resemble those via steady-state intravenous infusion. The human forearm compartment overcomes some limitations when scaling a rat PBPK model to humans where the venous sampling sites are different.  This human PBPK model for nicotine will be useful for examining differences in the time course of pharmacodynamic responses to nicotine following the indicated routes of administration. __label__Report

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-1, Whitaker Park. RIRT may proceed with the installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modification.  For this modification, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct application of natural menthol at a maker will not significantly affect the current emission factor used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including menthol application to other brands, we would request certification of VOC emissions by use of appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certification would then be used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol  (FAS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated product.  537 North Spruce Street - Winston-Salem, NC 27101-1362 - Phone 910-727-8060 - Fax 910-727-2777  & Recycled Paper     Lye6 99¢2eS __label__Letter

DOPAMINE.DOC Page? TALKING POINTS REGARDING STUDY IN NATURE |  Much media attention has been given to the story about smoking, an enzyme called monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), and a neurotransmitter called dopamine. The press reports say the study claims that smokers have a lower concentration of the MAO-B enzyme in their brains. The study claims that since the MAO-B enzyme breaks down dopamine, having a lower level of this enzyme presumably has the effect of giving smokers an "addictive high" resulting from higher levels of dopamine. The study's authors claim that this could explain why smoking is “addictive.”  There are important points which may not be clear to readers from these press reports.  It is unreasonable and illogical to equate dopamine with “addiction.". Dopamine release is found in a wide array of situations and events. Animals studies have shown that dopamine is released as a result of both positive and negative circumstances -- including painful or stressful situations that would certainly not create reinforcing or "addictive" behavior.  Dopamine release can be triggered by any important or emotional event -- whether it's pleasurable or painful stimulation. For example, hungry rats which are fed then release dopamine; and thirsty rats who get water release dopamine when they drink. But stressful or painful experiences -- such as an electric shock -- also  stimulate the release of dopamine.  If these animal studies reflect to some degree the human situation, then the same thing would hold true: dopamine release is stimulated by both pleasant and painful experiences -- whether it comes from seeing someone you're very happy to see, or dropping a heavy object on your foot.  Based on media reports about the dopamine study, it's impossible to tell whether the study reported was controlled for confounding variables -- such as diet, how much someone smokes, or how recently they smoked before the study. These variables would be critical in determining what role, if any, smoking might play in the reduction of dopamine. Aside from smoking, many other aspects of the lifestyles of smokers and non-smokers tend to be very different -- which introduces confounding variables into studies of differences between smokers and non-smokers.  The study's authors compare the effects of smoking to the effect of drugs such as heroin and cocaine, Although there are issues regarding the molecular affects of certain substances that we don't understand very well, it is obvious that there are clear behavioral differences between people who smoke and people who use drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Regardless of how you define addiction, cigarettes are clearly not in the same class as addictive, mind-altering drugs like heroine and cocaine. For example, smokers do not become intoxicated or suffer from black-outs. The fact that behaviors like smoking or drinking coffee may be difficult for some people to stop does not mean they are addictive. Any behavior you enjoy can be difficult to change -- depending on the individual and the situation. ,  Note: If someone wanted a reference to a published scientific article on this subject, our Legal or R&D Department could provide a citation.

Reynolds Tobacco Company Public Affairs Counsc)  P.O. Box 12945  Salem, OR 97309  Dear Mr. Nelson,  Certain industries in the United States, such as the tobacco industry, have been obligated to pay a disproportionate share of publicly funded health care costs.  With ap aging population and an increase in employer mandated health msurance requirements al the state level. costs to the tobacco industry are destined to increase. Only drastic changes in the health care delivery system can prevent this spirating cosi.  Market research indicates 90% of Oregonians want alternative medicine included in their health  plan. That is why the 1995 Oregon Legislature passed an alternative medicine bill, which was limited in scope.  The New England Jounal of Medicine published a national study done by Harvard University, in 1993, which determined that over one-third of Americans use some form of non-traditional health  care and pay for it out of their own pocket. This will not change if managed care and insurance comparucs have their way.  Meanwhile, profit and not for-profit forces have overtly pressured physicians into the anemviable funcuon of commercial agent to increase the profitability of health care organizations. This subjective distortion of the physician’s obligation has put at risk the historical trust that is the central element of the physician-patient relationship. Health care professionals are increasing!y faced with the dilemma of choosing between patient welfare and the profit of the health care dclivery system. We believe this is neither good health care nar beneficial to you and aur society.  That's why Orcgonians have launched the Health Care Freedoms Lmtiative (HCFI }, which will: ° help assure ciuizens* choice of category of health care provides, 6 put the patient back into the consumer's role:  ° lower the overall cost of health care,  e clear away many of the obstacles between pauient and provider and once again allow the free market to work TIOR 0023662 hE TY Vb fone von y __label__Letter

Dilibertot, Gerry Gordon, and Brian Hermani§1  From the tLaboratories for Cell RBiciogy, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy and the §Cancer Cell Biology Program, Lineberger Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27399  Three specific platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms are thought to bind with differing affinities to two distinct PDGF receptors which undergo activation following dimerization. Recent evi- dence has been presented that marked differences exist between the ability of PDGF-AA versus PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB to stimulate alterations in second messen- gers in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), a result which was thought to be due to low numbers of the A-type receptor in this cell type (Sach- inidis, A., Locker, R., Vetter, W., Tatje, D., and Hoppe, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10238-10243, 1990), In particular, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB but not PDGF- AA could elicit alterations in cytosolic free calcium (Ca**,). However, because these studies were per- formed on large cell populations using biochemical as- says of PDGF activity, a minor PDGF-AA-Ca?'-re- sponsive population of cells might go undetected. To test this possibility, VSMC were isolated from either thoracic or abdominal pig aorta, and alterations in Ca**; were monitored using Multiparameter Digitized Video Microscopy following stimulation with PDGF isoforms alone, or either before or after exposure of VSMC to 5 mm EGTA. PDGF-AA-responsive cells were found to exist only in cultures of thoracic VSMC, caused oscillations in Ca”*;, represented 20% of the PDGF-BB-responsive cells, and were subsequently re- sponsive to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB elicited monophasic alterations in Ca?*; in both thoracic and abdominal VSMC. Prior addition of EGTA inhibited PDGF-AA but not PDGF-BB-induced alterations in Ca?*;, Addi- tion of EGTA during PDGF-AA-induced Ca**; oscilla- tions inhibited subsequent oscillations in Ca”*;, while addition of EGTA at the peak of the PDGF-BB Ca** response resulted in a more rapid return of Ca**; to prestimulation levels. These data suggest that regional differences in the distribution of PDGF-A- and B-type receptor exists in viva, and that activation of the A- and B-type PDGF receptors results in distinct altera- tions in Ca’*;,  * This work was supported by Grants AG07218, AG10104, 2-PO1- CA29589, and 2-P30-C.A16086 from the National Institutes of Health. the Gustavus and Louise Pfeiffer Research Foundation, and Grant FRA-383 from the American Cancer Society.

PDGF" elicits a variety of biological activities in VSMC (mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and vasoconstriction) through the existence of distinct PDGF isoforms and receptors (1-4). Human PDGF consists of two disulfide-bonded homologous peptide chains, A and B (PDGF-AB). Each chain is the product of a distinct cellular gene, their expression being independently regulated and the two chains sharing approxi- mately 50% homology (5-7). Porcine PDGF appears to be a BB homodimer as is PDGF isolated from most animal species (except human} (8). Skeletal and smooth muscle, growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts and a number of tumor cell lines produce exclusively PDGF-AA (9-11).  These different types of PDGF molecules are thought to bind to at least two distinct types of PDGF receptors. The originally described receptor (B-type, 180 kDa, similar to the CSF-1 receptor) was found to bind the B chain of PDGF, is located on chromosome 4 and possesses tyrosine kinase activ- ity (12). A second type of PDGF receptor (A-type, 170 kDa, similar to the c-kit gene product) is thought to bind both PDGF A and B chains, is located on chromosome 4, and also contains tyrosine kinase activity (13). Since the receptors display some selectivity in terms of which PDGF chains they can bind, and because active PDGF molecules are thought to exist as dimers, a number of models have recently been proposed where PDGF binding to its receptors requires di- merization of the A- and B-type receptor subunits to elicit functional activity (14-16). These models predict that dimer- ization of two A-type receptors could lead to binding of all three types of PDGF isoforms (AA, BB, AB), while dimeri- zation of two B-type receptors could only lead to binding of PDGF-BB (although some data suggests that PDGF-AB can bind to cells containing only the B-type receptor albeit at 10- fold lower affinity than PDGF-BB). A key aspect of these models is that in cells lacking the A-type PDGF receptor, there should be no response to either PDGF-AA or PDGF- AB.  The mechanisms by which PDGF binding to its receptor is transduced into biological activity are still unclear. Our lab- oratory has been studying the role of POGF-induced altera- tion in Ca**; in PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis (17-21). PDGF addition to a variety of cells causes a rapid transient increase in Ca’*,; within seconds of addition (22), and results from our laboratory as well as others (17-21, 23-31) demonstrate that inhibition of POGF-stimulated increases in Ca**; also inhibit  ?

There was much redundancy; I have tried to select descriptive, represen- tative abstracts that represent the whole.  In brief, ultrasound applied appropriately to a forming device (press, extruder, drawing device, etc.) does have a measurable positive effect upon a formikp operation. This effect may be: decreased friction (in- creased die life); increased extrusion speed; better surface appearance, better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not persent.  |  I'm sure there are trade offs among these several effects, and I'm also  sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel {  source must be evaluated for the project at hand.  The attached four pages of abstracts will give the reader a feeling  for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960's and 70's  but originated in the late 50's. ~  ;  {  I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.  ped Vieere  .

Copyright & 1995 by the Cenetics Society of America  The fog-3 Gene and Regulation of Cell Fate in the Germ Line of Caenorhabditis elegans  Ronald E. Ellis and Judith Kimble  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 33706  Manuscript received September 8, 1994 Accepted for publication October 1, 1994  ABSTRACT  In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, germ celis normally adopt one of three fates: mitosis, spermato- genesis or oogenesis. We have identified and characterized the gene fog-3, which is required for germ cells to differentiate as sperm rather than as oocytes. Analvsis of double mutants suggests that fog-3 is absolutely required for spermatogenesis and acts at the end of the regulatory hicrarchy controlling sex determination for the germ line. By contrast, mutations in fog-3 do not alter the sexual identity of other tissues. We also have characterized the null phenotype of fog-/, another gene required for spermatogene- sis; we demonstrate that it too controls the sexual identity of germ cells but not of other tissues. Finally, we have studied the interaction of these two fog genes with gld-J, a gene required for germ cells to undergo oogenesis rather than mitosis. On the basis of these results, we propose that germ-cell fate might be controlled by a set of inhibitory interactions among genes that specily one of three fates:     mitosis, spermatogenesis or oogenesis. Such a regulatory network would link the  cell fate to the suppression of the other two.  URING animal development, the establishment of  sexual identity is crucial for the proper regulation of many cell fates. In the nematode C. elegans, for exam- ple, the copulatory organs, their underlying muscula- ture, the neurons that control these muscles, the so- matic gonad and the germ tissue all differ markedly between the two sexes. These differences are controlled by a common signal, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes (Mapt and Herman 1979). Animals with two X chromosomes and two sets of autosomes develop as hermaphrodites, whereas animals with one X chro- mosome develop as males. This X-A signal is interpre- ted by a set of regulatory genes that establish the sexual identity of the animal (reviewed by HopGxin 1990; VILLENEUVE anc MevER 1990; KuwaBARA and KIMBLE 1992). We are interested in how the genes that control sexual idenury specify individual cell fates. To study this process, we are analyzing the development of the germ line,  Several factors make the germ line of C. elegans attrac- tive for studying the regulation of cell fate. First, germ cells adopt two terminal fates, each of which can be identified easily: in males they differentiate to form sperm, whereas in hermaphrodlites the first germ cells to differentiate form sperm, but later ones develop as oocytes (HIRSH ef al. 1976), Second, the germ line is the only tissue in the nematode for which new cells are        Corresponding au udith Kimble, Laboratory of Molecular Biol- ogy, 1524 Linden Dove, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706.

This pattern differs from the reproducible set of cell disi- sions that create the soma of C. elegans (SULSTON and Horvrrz 1977; Ristair and HirsH 1979; SULSTON ef al. 1983), but resembles the homeostatic regulation of tis- sue size in higher organisms. Thus, in the germ line. one can analyze how the control of proliferation inter- acts with the regulation of cell fate. Third, powerful genetic methads have been developed for the idenufi- cation of genes that reguiate the sexual identity of gerra cells (¢.g., BARTON ef af 1987; BARTON and KIMBLE 1990).  In this paper, we report the identification and charac- terization of the fog-3 gene, which is required to specifK that germ cells differentiate as sperm rather than as aocytes. Because this gene does not control the sexuai fate of somatic lissiies, we have adopted the name fog. which indicates “ jeminization of the germ line.”” Muta- tions in a second gene, jog], show an identical pheno type (BARTON and KimpLE 1990). We demonstrate that some of these fog-] mutations inactivate fag-1, indicating that it, like fag-3, 1                       ulates the sexual idendty of ge cells, but not of other lissues. Finally, studies of epistasis indicate that both jug-d and fag-3 act in response to the genes of the sex-detcrmination pathway. We propose that fog] and fog-3 respond to this information abou: sexual identity so as to control the fates of specific cells. those of the germ line.

In an article in Fortune (Page 121, November 17, 1980), Brown and Williamson explained that "percent tar free" was derived by dividing the weight of tar in a puff by the total weight of all material in a puff, including the dilution air and the smoke stream. The smoke stream differs from the dilution air because of the particulate phase and enhanced quantities of the major combustion gases (carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide). Cigarette dilution combines an air stream with the smoke stream in a given proportion by volume and passes the resultant nicotine through a cellulose acetate  filter to remove a fraction of the tar, nicotine, and water.  The fraction of each component removed.is different and depends on the specific filter efficiency. The volume percent of the gaseous components in the stream is not significantly changed by the filtration because the particulate phase occupies such a small percentage by volume. An air particulate stream that is, a 90-10% ratio by weight is a 99.9-0.1% ratio by volume, ° because of the large differences in density between the gases and solids. oo .  The weight percent of the smoke stream was evaluated using the data presented by Baker at the 1980 TCRC meeting in Richmond, Virginia and is shown in Column 3 of Table 1. These numbers are in good agreement with previous results of M. E. Hobbs, Invited Paper, CORESTA/TCRC, Williamsburg, Va. 1972. Combining | these values with known molecular weights (Table 1, Column 2), the volume percent composition of the stream is evaluated and is shown in Column 4 of Table 1. This smoke stream is then combined with the dilution air stream in a. volume ratio (100-D):D, where D is the cigarette dilution, to give the results shown in Column 6 of Table 1. The volume percent of tar, nicotine and water deliveries to the smoker has been assumed to be zero and is certainly less than 1% for high dilution cigarettes. The actual volume percent of tar cannot be calculated without knowing the filtration efficiency of the filter for the particulate phase, whereas the gas stream composition is unaffected on passing through the filter. The values in Column 7 of Table 1 are derived | by two different methods. The tar weight is the value derived experimentally by weighing the Cambridge pads from FTC smoking and subtracting nicotine and water. Nicotine and water weights are derived by extraction techniques on the Cambridge pad.  2042790056 __label__Memo
-63- Schoendorf and Kiely (1992)  The first study to independently examine maternal smoking during and after pregnancy  - was published by Schoendorf and Kiely (1992). They performed a case-control analysis of data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Within this dataset, 201 black and 234 white autopsied SIDS cases were identified from death certificates; approximately 3,000 controls for each race were used. The analysis was restricted to infants weighing >2,500 grams at birth. Mothers were questioned regarding their level of cigarette consumption during pregnancy and at the time of interview, and from their responses categorized as nonsmokers, smokers after pregnancy only, or smokers during and after pregnancy. After adjustment for maternal age, education, and marital status, maternal smoking only after pregnancy had an OR of 1.8 (CI 1.0, 3.0) for whites and 2.3 (C1 =1.5, 3.7) for blacks. The risk of SIDS among infants of women who smoked both during and after pregnancy was 3.1 (CI =2.3, 4.2) and 3.1 (CI =2.2, 4.3) for whites and blacks respectively. The ORs for “passive” (postnatal) and “combined” (pre- and postnatal) exposure were not directly comparable, as mothers who smoked during and after pregnancy tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than mothers who smoked only after pregnancy. The authors also examined the risk of SIDS in relation to the presence of other smokers in the household. In whites, household smoking was significantly associated with SIDS (OR=1.4, CI=1.0, 1.9), but no relationship was seen in blacks (OR=0.9, CI 0.7, 1.3). This latter analysis controlled for mother's smoking status only.  Mitchell et al, (1993)  Final results from the New Zealand case-control study were published in Mitchell ef al. (1993). The study's catchment area covered 78% of all live births in New Zealand during the 3-year study period. Four hundred eighty-five SIDS cases were compared to 1,800 controls. Case infants were much more likely than were control infants to have mothers who had smoked in the two weeks prior to interview (OR=4.1, CI=3.3, 5.1). The OR decreased to 1.7 (CI=1.2, 2.3) but was still significant at the p=0.05 level after adjusting  for: region, season, breastfeeding, and bed sharing; mother's marital status, socioeconomic  EXTERNAL REVIEW DRAFT MARCH 1995  | | SA6ZSVELSOS |  { ‘ __label__Scientific

“  ‘14 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, : Tuesday, Dec. 13, 1977     —-  j Asbestos workers would get $20 million, including $5.7 million in an un- usual payment by the federal govern- ment, in a secret settlement of consoli- dated suits by the Tyler, Texas, work: ers. They had charged negligence that permitted exposure to cancer-causing asbestos.  ’ (Story on Page 14) * 2 *     ‘U.S. Reportedly Agrees in Asbestos Suit.  To Pay Portion of $20 Million Settlement        A WALL STREET JOURNAL News Roundup In an unusual move, the federa! govern-  ment has agreed to chip in $5.7 million as  part of a §20 million secret settlement of consolidated suits by 445 Tyler, Texas, as- bestos workers.  Despite a gag order by U.S. district court an all parties involved, Informed sources say that the workers, who sued the federal poverni.:cut and several private companies in 1974, were secretly offered a cash settle- ment in September. The sults allege public and private negligence that allowed workers to be exposed innocently to cancer-causing asbestos, specifically a type called amosite. The settlement, whicn allows conclusion of the suits without specific blame being placed with anyone, was sealed until at least Thursdav.  The Tyler workers sued the companies that owned the plant since its opening in 1% until it closed in 1972 as well as asbes- tos suppliers. The defendants include Pitts- burgh Corning Corp., a company jointly owned by PPG Industries Inc. and Corning Glass Works that operated the Tyler plant from 1962 until 1972. These three companies will pay workers about $8.1 million, sources said.  Other defendants include Union Asbestos     ’  -~——- —________._,| the plant came from federal stockp     eee & Rubber Co., of Chicago, which will pay $1 million. The British holding company of Cape Industries Ltd. and its subsidiaries were also sued and will pay $.2 million.  owns asbestos mining and marketing con- cerns in Africa, London, and the U.8., sources  said. . The federal government's share of the  settlement totals $5.7 million. The payout was arrived at as the result of charges of withholding bealth information on workplace conditions.  Specifically, federal authorities were charged with entering into a secret agree- ment with the plant's management to with- hold from workers findings of high asbestos levels in the air. Sources said that the agreement was entered into by the Public Health Service, which thought it wouldn’t otherwise be allowed right of entry to in- spect the workplace in 1964 as part of a sur- vey of 38 plants. However, another charge against the government was that eg the Flant was operating under federal contract it fell within the realm of the Walsh-Healy Act, which requires the government to en- sure that workers for @ federal contractor have a safe workplace. The plant made as- bestos insulation to supply Navy veseels.  Sources sald that some asbestos used at Jes in unmarked sacks. Sources said that federal officials made depositions that admit to the Government Services Administration’s sale of unmarked asbestos up to two years ago, and said GSA still sells asbestos, although it is properly labeled.  The suits were brought after Tyler work- ers became concerned about unhealthy work conditions. Sources said that 25 deaths have been directly attributed to the workplace conditions, and that about 70 to 80 asbesto- sis, or lung disease, cases have been docu- mented over the last few years. Also, un-  ‘| usually high numbers of a rare lung cancer  called mesothelioma has continued to show up among former plant workers,  PPG Industries declined comment on the proposed settlement end other defendants weren't available for comment.

O5/02/04 10:53 @ 19107274902 W. KLEIN & ASSOC. «== PUBLIC RELATIONS [003,004  FACT CARD: Good Arguments Against The Government's Proposed Smoking Ban  Our federal government is pushing two proposals that would ban smoking almost everywhere  nee “aT he first threat Is HR 3434, the sweeping new bill proposed by Congressman Hanry then ~.. Waxman, It would ban smoking in virtually all indoor public places — plus eame outdoor ones) “fa  hea second threat comes from OSHA = the Occupational Safety and Health Ps:2 Administration. These unglectad bureaucrats want to outlaw smoking in nearly all workplaces  nationwide. Here are some strong arguments against these government bans. Fee! free to make these points (in your own words) when you write to Congress.          « Secondhand smoke Isn't the Issue. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a Class A carcinogen. But this finding has drawn criticism fromm prominent scientists. The Congressional Research Service has called the EPA's report into question. And the report Is being challenged in court. OSHA should base Its regulations on sound sclence — not political science.  * The current system works. Across America, employers, building managers, and local  elected officials have designed smoking policies that work. Smoking and nonsmoking sections are the norm in most areas. And according to polls, two-thirds of Americans  find this arrangement acceptable. So there’s no need for the federal government to further reguiate this Issue.  * The proposed regulations go too far. In some cases, the proposed rules would invade the privacy of the homa. if you pay aomeane to work inside your home, you  could be prohibited from smoking there,  ¢ This Is just another attempt at backdoor Prohibition. These government proposals represent the anti-smokere’ latest campaign to erase smoking from American culture.  These politicians have a political agenda, and it has nothing to do with protecting non- smokers from secondhand smoke. But it Prohibition Is what the anti-smokers want, let  them stand up in Congress and put Prohibition to a vote. They'll find that the majority of Americans do not want a return to Prohibition!  Other Steps You Can Take To Stop Government Smoking Bans:  + Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper. Use the points above to argue against the proposed smoking bans. Keep your letter short (about 260 words). For the address where you should send your letter, see your newspaper's editorial page.  « Talla friend about the proposed bans. R.J.

Grant 10}2-AR]  J. Andrew Mitchell, Ph.D.  Assistant Professor of Anatomy  School of Medicine  Wayne State University ' 540 East Canfield Street  Detroit, Michigan 4820)  Implantation and Uterine Function in the Rat.  Considerable evidence indicates that nicotine adversely affects pregnancy in the rat. Among such disruptive effects are increased frequency of fetal resorption, reduced litter size and weight, and delayed parturition. The primary objective of the experiments embodied in this study is to gain a greater understanding of the means by which nicotine exerts disruptive effects on the     normal course of pregnancy, and more particularly, how the chief alkaloid of tobacco  reduces litter size and delays parturition. To this end, a variety of parameters will be measured to assess reproductive efficiency, time of implantation, fetal  growth and development, and normalcy of parturition in nicotine-treated vs. control rats.  Severa] experimentally testable hypotheses are proposed. Specifically, experiments will be conducted to determine if nicotine-induced reduction in litter size and delay in parturition are related to alterations in uterine sensitivity to implantation. The time of onset, magnitude and duration of sensitivity to decidualization will be compared in treated and control rats. In addition, the  effects of nicotine on duration of gestation will be determined by an accurate measurement of the time of parturition.  Recent experiments have demonstrated that both the development of the preimplantation blastocyst and the time of zona pellucida loss are delayed in nicotine-treated rats.

This test involved two manufactured versions of previously tested 979-C:  1057-A, a translation of 979-C with a 2% weight increase; 1057-B, a direct translation of 979-C.  Results indicate that both 1057-A and 1057-B were effective translations of 979-C. Among competitive smokers, 1057-A was at parity with 979-C on most attributes including the key attributes of harshness and smoothness. Manufactured product 1057-B was also at parity with 979-C on most attributes but had a directional disadvantage on harshness.  Due to recent improvements in the performance of current WINSTON Lights  85's, neither manufactured product is an improvement versus the in-mar- ket product among competitive smokers.  ~ 1657-A shows a directional improvement on harshness, but is at parity  on smoothness. This product also has an advantage on mildness, but has tobacco taste and artificial taste deficiencies.  ~ 1057-B is at parity with current on all attributes.  ~ As shown below, both products are at overall parity with current  WINSTON Lights 85's among competitive smokers and inferior to Marlboro Lights 85's.

Mini-Review  Plasma Membrane Protein Sorting in Polarized Epithelial Cells  Keith Mostov, Gerard Apodaca, Benjamin Aroeti, and Curtis Okamoto Departments of Anatomy, and Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Cardiovascular Research Institute, Box 0452, University of  California, San Francisco, California 94143-0452  function of most eukaryotic cells. A basic aspect of this polarity is that the cell’s plasma membrane is divided into discrete domains. Examples include the membranes of axons and dendrites in neurons, the growing bud and mating projection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and lamel- lipodia in fibroblasts. However, the best-studied type of polarity is found in epithelia, which is the most common type of tissue in animals (52, 56). In simple epithelia the cells form a monolayer where one surface of the cell—the apical —faces the outside world or a topologically equivalent space, such as the lumen of the intestines. This is separated by tight junctions from the basolateral surface, which con- tacts adjacent cells and the underlying connective tissue. Apical and basolateral surfaces have very different protein and lipid compositions (4, 10, 57). For example, the basolateral surface contains receptors for adhering to other cells and the basement membrane, and for uptake of nutrients from the circulation. The apical surface contains transporters for exchanging small molecules with the outside world. As epithelial cells divide and differentiate they must send proteins to the correct surface to establish their polarity (25). Moreover, in a differentiated epithelial cell, polarity is maintained despite an enormous flux of membrane compo- nents traveling to and from each surface.  S PATIAL asymmetry is fundamental to the structure and  Pathways to the Cell Surface  As shown in Fig. 1, epithelial cells use two pathways to send proteins to the correct surface. Newly made proteins can travel directly from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)' to ei- ther the apical or basolateral surface. Alternatively, proteins can use an indirect pathway traveling first from the TGN to the basolateral surface, followed by endocytosis and trans- cytosis to the apical surface (46, 55). The former pathway was discovered in MDCK cells which form a well-polarized monolayer when cultured on a permeable support. In pio- neering work, Rodrigucz-Boulan and Sabatini (53) showed that influenza virus buds solely from the apical surface,     |. Abbreviations used in this paper.

Viral envelope proteins, hemagglu- tinin (HA) of influenza and G protein of VSV (VSVG), travel through the secretory pathway together to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here they are packaged into separate vesi- cles that carry these proteins to the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively (24, 51). Newly made endogenous MDCK proteins are also delivered directly from the TGN to their final destination (33). Hepatocytes, in contrast, lack a pathway from the TGN to the apical (canalicular) surface and rely entirely on the indirect, transcytotic route (3}. The enterocyte-like CaCo-2 cell line uses a mixture of the direct and transcytotic strategies (32, 42). For several apical pro- teins a fraction is delivered directly from the TGN to the api- cal surface, while the balance follows the transcytotic route. MDCK cells can also use the transcytotic route, as was shown for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transfected into these cells (45), as well as for endogenous proteins (5).  Both the cell type and the protein influence the route taken to the apical surface. For example, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and aminopeptidase N (APN) use the transcytotic route in liver and both routes in CaCo2 cells. When trans- fected into MDCK cells, they mainly use the direct route from the TGN to the apical surface (39, 66). However, about 20% of both travel to the MDCK basolateral surface. In the case of APN, this was judged to be a non-transcytosing pool, although transcytosis was evaluated indirectly (66). If true, this would imply that in MDCK cells, basolateral APN is un- able to be transcytosed and that transcytosis depends on the cell type. In contrast, we found that the 20% of DPP-IV reaching the basolateral surface is then transcytosed (11). The fraction of DPP-IV going to the basolateral surface varies with the cell type, but it is transeytosed efficiently in all cells (40). In contrast the pIgR exclusively uses the trans- cytotic route regardless of the cell type.  Whereas the TGN to apical pathway is present only in cer- tain cells, transcytosis is found in all epithelial cells exam- ined. The importance of transcytotic sorting is emphasized by the fact that while roughly 5% of the cell surface is newly made per hour, the equivalent of about 50% of the cell sur- face is endocytosed per hour (63). Most endocytosed pro- teins simply recycle, but without exquisite selectivity for en- try into the transcytotic pathway, the two surfaces of the cell would be rapidly scrambled.  The amount of a protein at a surface depends on the rates  of delivery and removal due to endocytosis and/or degrada-  577 __label__Scientific

Tobacco - Europe  FRANCE: CAN THE EVIN BILL ON TOBACCO BE APPLIED?     La Tribune Desfogses, 12 Jul 1995, p.29:-  CNCT,< a French association in charge of making sure that the Evin bill on limiting advertisement on tobacco and alcoholic products is enforced properly, >is being involved in a number of legal issues with tobacco makers in France.  This its because the tobacco manufacturers are bypassing the Evin bill, which proves to be difficult to enforce.  In addition to contesting a number of statements of the bill, like arguing that it is a hindrance to personal Freedom, the tobacco makers keep presenting scientific surveys which tend to prove that tobacco cannot damage health.  CNCT algo fights this, arguing that the studies are biased owing to the fact that tha tobacco makers finance them. The association denounced recently a study by Jean-Jacques Rosa of IEP<, the French institute of political studies>, which showed that tobacco was more profitable than damageable to the community. The study was financed by CDIT, the French entity which supplies information and documentation on tobacco>.  (ESMERK/FRENCH/ER .

4/14/88 CU:. DRS. JACOBSON ,GLENN,SOMMERS SCIENTIFIC STAFF  February 24, 1988  GRANT APPLICATION NO. 2284  Joseph D. Fenstermacher, Ph.D., State University of New York  Dr. Fenstermacher a professor of physiology and biophysics in Stonybrook, New York, is interested in experiments on the rat to’ determine and relate local cerebral blood flow and correlate it with local glucose utilization. He divided his goals in a whole series of subdivisions, and hypotheses. These hypotheses are related to the effect of nicotine on both cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization. For that purpose two experimental series of rats will be used, control and those with nicotine exposure. All methods are highly jndirect. For example, he will use quantitative autoradiography, in which the optical density is related to the radioactivity from standard data, he will use light microscopy in order to study morphometry. Blood flow will be measured with 14C iodoantipyrine. He seems to believe quite firmly in the idea that there is recruitment of blood vessels in the brain, a fact which has never been verified by direct observations. He also thinks that with this methodology he is able to determine volume of perfused microvessels. Despite a multiplicity of specific aims and hypotheses, it really boils down to a correlation between local blood flow and local glucose utilization.  Since all methods are indirect, they are beset with a difficulty of drawing conclusion which are very involved and difficult to substantiate. For example, quantitative autoradiography, iodoanti- pyrine measurement of surface area and permeability products all these  are highly speculative. __label__Scientific

Comes pate: July 16, 1985 _L. He Thompson  - Comparison of X6D5BFR (control) to X6D5BFS (test)         Two cigarette types, a control filler sprayed with water (X6D5BFR):;. and a control filler (X6D5BFS) sprayed with an additive (M1004), were submitted for testing in the S/M assay (1). The objective of this. experiment was to determine if a decrease in the amount of M1004 added to the filler from a previous. experi- ment. (2), would show a significant difference between the test sample and the control. Previous. results (2) showed that the control filler + additive had a significantly higher specific activity (S.A.) than control filler + water. Four 6008 (3). smokings of these samples were carried out by members of Charge No. 6908. (3).  The IT CSC's from the replicate smokings (prepared as lOmg/m1i stock solu- tions im DMSO) were tested randomly in strain TA98+S9 according to the: standard procedure (4,5) using doses of 0.05,0.10, 0.15. and 0.20 mg CSC/plate. The control data from this. experiment were within) normal ranges.  Table 1 shows the analysis of variance on the experimental results (performed using "Minitab").. Statistically, there was no difference between the control and the test sample. This result implies that. adding this compound to filler at a lower level may. not have a significant effect on activity. However, iit should be noted! that except for smoking 3,. all of the S.A.s for the test sample were higher than the S.A.s of the control. The: resulting mean S.A. for the test samples would reflect the variation im smoking 3.. Therefore, a repeat experiment and perhaps even more smokings. would be: needed’ to veriify these results. The: average CSC yield/cigarette was the same for each cigarette type  (Table 1). ek Z MLE  cc: Dr. J.. L. Charles Dr. C.K. Ellis Dr. R. N. Ferguson Dr. B.. B. Sanders  4vSb20e  D98 __label__Memo

dune 2.  Hepatitis A: antibodies are but illness is not  prevalent  Research on hepatitis A may lag behind that on hepatitis 8, but a clinical picture of type A disease is becoming more clear.  The words “subclinical picture” might be more accurate, however, because according t Jules L. Dien- ptag. MD, and co-workers, much of the disease produced by the hepatitis A virus is not clinically apparent. They suggest it is this sporadic, inapparent infection that maintains the hepatitis A virus in nature between major detectable outbreaks  Recently in New York City, in serological testing of more than 1,000 specimens. this research team foun antibodies to hepatitis A virus in 91% of middle class volunteer blood donors and in 60% of poor persons frotn the inner city. Despite this prevalence, less than 5% of these people could remember having had heps- titis. The investigators say this is “consistent with the belief that most cases are clinically inapparent ”  Even when hepatitis A is clinically apparent. Dr Dienstag told an American College of Physicians audience in Boston, usually it is a mild, self-limited illness. Hepatic encephalopathy develops in a few patients, but, in the outbreaks that Dr Dienstag and colleagues have studied. all patients have survived. Thus, he ssid, evidence from these and other studies euggests thot hepatitis A rarely fulminates, and the virus so far has not been associated serologically with chronic liver disease.  Until recently, he says, most of what was known about the epidemiology of hepatitis A was learned from studies with volunteers and observations during natural outbreaks. Now that the hepatitis A virus has been identified and its antibody can be detected by immune adherence hemagglutination, radioimmu- noassay, complement fixation. and immune electron microscopy, “the means are at hand to test and extend our current underetanding of this virus.”  The virus contains RNA, Dr Dienstag pointed ovt, and it is “most likely an enterovirus” of the icosahedral picorna group, “although a few properties don’! fir”  He and his colleagues report that exposure to hepa- titis A virus is much more likely than exposure to the type B virus. A two to six times greater prevalence of antibodies to type A than to type B has been found in most populations studied in the United States and for both sexes The likelihood of exposure increases with the person's age, decreases with rising socroeconemic class. and varies from country to country in relation to their stages of development, emphasis on sanita-  JAMA.

With regord to age. the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus increases with age in all socioeco- nomic groups tested, approaching 80% among persons 50 or older. It is possible that these older people were exposed to the virus years ago when living conditions were leas hygienic. Support for this idea is found in the declining number of reported childhood cases of hepatitis A in this country in recent years. However, anti-hepatitis A titers in immune serum globulin collected in large cities like Boston in the last 30 years have not shown a similar decline.  Another possibility is that, et least in urban areas, there may be continuous exposure throughout life At least half the people living in the lowes socioeconomic areas of New York appear to become infecied by the time they reach their 20s. But in neighborhoods where people of a higher socioeconomic class live, serological testing by age groups has to extend to people in their 40; and $0s before o SO% rate of exposure is reached.  Say Dr Dienstag and colleagues’ “One implication of these seroepidemiologic studies is the advisability of preparing immune serum globulin from plasma of older, lower socioeconomic class urban individuals ”  The inverse relationship of exposure to hepatitis A virus and socioeconomic class hes been reported by several investigators and holds “whether sotivece- nomic class is defined by level of education, religious group, working class or prison status. census classif- cation, or underdeveloped vs developed counir: ~  continued on pay: 2386     Medical Nows  Medical News ~         ,     1978     2329  pps. __label__Scientific

DEVELOIHENTAL BIOLOGY 129, 169-178 (1988)  Molecular Consequences of awa®*, A Cell-Autonomous Lethal Mutation  of Drosophila Induced by Hybrid Dysgenesis  CHARLES R. DEAROLF,! NICK TRIPOULAS, JOE BIGGS, AND ALLEN SHEARN Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218  Accepted May 2, 1988  The abnormal wing disc locus, which is at salivary gland chromosome position 100C-D of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, has been identified by a recessive lethal mutation, awd™, induced by hybrid dysgenesis. When homozygous, this mutation eauses abnormal development of the brain, the ovaries, and the larger imaginal discs as described in the preceding paper (C. R. Dearolf, E. Hersperger, and A. Shearn, 1988, Dev. Biol. 129, 159-168). The DNA corre- sponding to this locus was isolated from a genomic library prepared from awd” heterozygotes by screening with a P-element probe. The awd” aliele resulted from the insertion of a P-element fragment into a gene that encodes an 0.8-kb poly(A)* RNA. In mutant larvae, that 0.8-kb transcript is replaced by two chimeric transcripts that are 0.7 and 1.3kbin length, both of which contain P-element and awd sequences. The wild-type azwd* gene transcript is most abundant during the second and third larval instars but is found at a lower level during every developmental stage as well as in continuous cell lines. Thus the azwd* gene transcript can be detected in normal larvae at a developmental stage long before defects are expressed in mutant larvae. Moreover, some tissues, for example the salivary gland of nonmutant, third-instar larvae, contain high levels of this transcript, even though these tissues appear to develop normally in  mutant larvae. ©1988 Academic Press, Inc.  INTRODUCTION  The abnormal wing discs (awd) gene of Drosophila was identified in a screen for hybrid-dysgenic late larval/ early pupal lethal mutations (Dearolf et al, 1988). The most obvious defect caused by mutations at this locus is the abnormal morphology of wing dises dissected from homozygous mutant, third-instar larvae. Such dises are smaller than normal discs of a comparable age, they are misshapen, and they are incapabie of differentiating a normal inventory of wing structures. Further studies revealed that the eye-antenna and leg discs are also affected by the mutation. Although those discs appear morphologically normal, they are also incapable of dif- ferentiating a normal inventory of imaginal structures. In addition to these imaginal disc defects, which were shown to be cell autonomous, it was observed that transplanted mutant ovaries were sterile and that the mutant central nervous system was histologically ab- normal (Dearolf, 1986; Dearolf et ai, 1988).  The developmental consequences caused by the awd’® lethal mutation provided some inferences about the normal requirements for the product of the gene (Dearolf et ai, 1988). It was inferred that during em- bryogenesis and early larval development the awd* gene is not required, that during the second half of normal larval development the awd* gene is required in  * Present address: Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineer- ing, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.  169     50603971  the wing disc as well as in the brain, and that somewhat later in development it is required in the eye-antenna and leg dises and the ovary.  However, the normal pattern of gene transcription cannot necessarily be determined from the analysis of the developmental consequences of mutations (McKeown ef al., 1987; Hartley et al, 1987). In order to determine the pattern of gene transcription for awd, we have isolated both genomic DNAs and cDNAs which correspond to the awd gene, analyzed the pattern of accumulation of the awd* transcript during normal de- velopment, and analyzed the effect of the awd muta- tion on that pattern. These results considerably extend what was inferred about the expression of the awd gene from studying the developmental consequences of mu- tations in the gene and have provided the foundation for identifying the awd protein.

Pls review carefully and provide feedback, we need to finalize this general outline and then move forward with implementation.  Clearly some of these iterns are long term efforts, but we need to provide tools to the RD's, and more importantly, a broad plan they can utilize in their own states in '99 and beyond.  Scott/Pam/Henry/Dan/Ted -- we need to pull a real plan together for each of the legislative orgs listed in the plan, and perhaps others. BUT, we must coordinate with YSP and follow their lead re: thoughts on how best they can support/complement our efforts. And there is the issue of over committing YSP and being streched too thin that we must always consider.  1 am happy to work with each of you along with KD, in pulling those plans together, with an emphasis on substantive policy results, not PR. As meetings are fast approaching, how does the end on  January sound for a deadline?  Josh/Tom/Chris -- what's the status of the state research, both state and fed dollars? Do we need to meet again re: the studies of states and their various approaches to the issue of youth smoking?

SUBJECT:  DETAILED FINDINGS  BACKGROUND/METHODOLOGY  The primary objective of this research was to further learn about Generation Xers. To achieve this objective, two focus groups were held among 18-24 year old males and females in Englewood, NJ. on June 3,1994.  Respondents were asked to discuss a number of issues, including:  « What they think Generation X is all about  ¢ Factors that unite and/or influence their generation  ¢ Similarities and differences between their generation and their parent's generation  ¢ Segments into which their generation can be divided and how those segments can be identified :  Towards the end of the groups, respondents were shown a number of print ads and were asked to sort them into piles depicting different segments of the population. They were then questioned about why the ads were for these specific groups, with a special focus on ads that they felt were for them  SUMMARY OF HINDINGS  These young adults view their generation as diverse, having varied interests and lifestyles. Differences between people are expected and accepted. These differences enable Generation Xers to have friends who are interested a variety of things and lead lives that are not the same as their own.  Despite the diversity found among these young adults, Generation Xers do appear to share certain attitudinal and behavioral characteristics. Specifically, these shared characteristics are that they:  - Resist segmentation and labeling  - Are self-focused  - Have mistrust for the news media  - Show marketing savvy  - Like to try new things and experience life  - Believe financial security is important but is not their ultimate goal  Respondents in both groups had heard of the term "Generation X", with some indicating that the term had negative connotations. Specifically, one young woman stated that Generation Xers "...supposedly don't care about anything."  9925698902 __label__Memo

Two separate aspects of this objective are:  1) The establishment of a Standard Communication Test  to serve as the primary research tool in ad/copy development.  2) To review all existing literature on print communication principles and ad research prin- ciples in order to heighten user understanding of why ad research is conducted as it is.  Establishment of Standard Communications Test  Accomplishments:  1) Design of test technique/methodology, including basic questionnaire, through consultation with J. Coulson.  2) Experiment with test to identify strengths and weaknesses and investigate any possible ad format bias (i.e., rough vs. finished ads, product vs. imagery predominant ads).  3) Documentation of test to establish sensitivity, reliability, and validity.  Results: A revised Policy and Procedure Manual for Copy Research which will define the role of the communications test and the role of the placement recall test in the copy research process (i.e., developmental vs. evaluative research). The revised manual will also provide detailed explanation of and docu- mentation for the two standard tests.

I enclose a new budget and other materials as requested, Although the award is for a lesser amount than we requested and for one year, it wil] be an enormous help in fulfilling ovr goals.  There is no overlap between the goals of this grant and that awarded by the National Cancer Institute to Dr. John Chan which will focus upon the molecular biological studics aimed at analyzing the gene involved in this disease, The studies supported by the Council under Grant No. 2257 will be focused upon the enzymology of the human cells. The appointment of Dr. Heahyun Yoo to this aspect of the project is to achieve that specific purpose. Dr. Yoo, a research associate in my laboratory, has an extensive background in enzymology as is evident by her CV and bibliography (enclosed).  Once again we thank you for this generous award and assure you of our efforts to guarantee its success,  Sincerely yours,  Ledovcl 1 (BeluiitD  Frederick F. Becker, .

Receptor-Specific Induction of Individual AP-1 Components in B Lymphocytes’  Li Huo* and Thomas L. Rothstein?**  Departments of *Medicine and ‘Microbiology and the *Evans Memorial Department of Clinical Research, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118  The inducible nuclear transcription factor complex, AP-1, typically consists of heterodimers between Jun and Fos proteins. Although components are drawn from families of related molecules, little is known about the physiologic regulation of jun- and fos-related gene products. In particular, it is not known whether expression of individual family members is stimulus-specific or whether the same signaling pathways are responsible for induction of all subunits. To clarify these issues, AP-1 components were examined following activation of primary 8 lymphocytes through two separate receptors, the surface Ig Ag receptor, and the CD40 receptor for T cell influences. Both forms of stimulation led to expression of JunB and JunD mRNA and protein; however, induction of JunB mediated by anti-lg Ab was protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, whereas induction mediated by CD40 ligand was resistant to PKC depletion. The two forms of stimulation diverged even further with respect to Fos expression. Although both stimuli induced c-Fos, expression of FosB was stimulus specific at both the mRNA and protein levels, in that this component was induced by anti-Ig but not by CD40 ligand. Stimulated expression ‘of c-Fos and FosB was in all cases PKC-independent. These results provide evidence for receptor-specific differences in the expression of AP-1 components, primarily with respect to FosB. They also indicate that separate intracellular pathways may be used for induction of jun and fos gene products and that the same transcription factor (junB) may be triggered by two surface receptors through separate pathways that differ in PKC dependence. The Journal of Immunology, 1995, 154: 3300-3309.  eceptor interactions at the B cell surface leading R to proliferative responses initiate a series of in-  tracellular biochemical events that eventuate in alteration of the resting program of gene expression as a result of nuclear changes that regulate transcriptional ac- tivation. The likely mediators coupling cytosolic signaling to transcriptional activation are sequence-specific DNA binding proteins or transcription factors that express trans- activating activity. In recent work we and others have demonstrated that B cell stimulation is associated with in- ducible nuclear expression or modification of several tran- scription factor complexes, including NF-«B, NF-AT,  CREB, and AP-1° (1-6, 6a, 6b). The AP-1 complex con- sists of two proteins that may be represented as homo- or heterodimers and that bind the consensus sequence TGACTCA (7). Constituent proteins are characterized by the presence of a leucine zipper that is involved in dimer formation and are drawn from two gene families, jun and fos. Jun proteins may homodimerize or heterodimerize with Fos protein to form DNA-binding AP-1; Fos is inca- pable of homodimerizing or binding DNA alone. Well de- scribed family members include c-jun (8, 9), junB (10), JunD (11, 12), c-fos (13, 14), and fosB (15-18), which may be expressed in two forms as a result of alternative splic- ing, a full length version and a short form (16-18). In addition, two Fos-related Ags, Fra-1 and Fra-2, have been described (19-21) although sequences for the murine sys- tem have not been reported. Clearly, the Jun and Fos fam- ilies represent an extensive grouping that is of special in- terest because of the large number of proteins from which inducible AP-1 may be drawn and hence the extensive     Received for publication September 16, 1994.

(2) Review and observe the operation of the forced-air curing system installed in selected flue-cured tobacco barns.  (3) Review other field tests and production programs.  SUMMARY:  In November, 1985, a virus-like disease of tobacco was observed that has the potential of threatening much of the Brazilian crop. Dr. Guy Gooding, NCSU phytopathologist and virus expert, agreed to conduct an on-site investigation of the disease. His observations, on-site antigen-antibody reactions, and subsequent laboratory tests demonstrated conclusively that the disease is caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).  The operation of several experimental forced-air curing systems, designed by Mr. Mike Bernard, and installed in flue-cured tobacco barns, was observed. In all cases, tobacco cured in the modified barns, as compared to that of  conventional barns, exhibited a significantly deeper-orange color and a sweeter aroma.  Most field investigation plots were beginning to suffer from the lack of rain; however, they will still produce valuable data. Most tests were set to the field early and are currently being harvested.  KEYWORDS:  Brazil, Curing, Disease, Seed, Flue-Cured Tobacco, Irrigation, Tomato Spotted Wilt, Varieties, Virus  STATUS:     This is an ongoing project. Future recommendations and research proposals are primarily contingent upon the results of the current experiments.  -l-  Sind 2LS0sS __label__Report

We are all pleased about the progress your group has made along with  that of Tom Budne in the development of improved and more sophisticated statistical analyses of product test data. Now that this work is being done on a routine basis for P.0.L. tests, it seems worthwhile expanding this system to cover H.T.I. There are several advantages jin Richmond's performing the same statistical analyses on H.T.I. and P.O.L. data.  The first is greater comparability in evaluating product tests results. Another is that any improvements your Department, Tom Budne or the Market  Research Department make in these analyses can be shared.

Raymond Subject: Weekly Summary, Project 2702, Week of 1/7/90  Single-Blade Carbon Heater Evaluation:  Evaluation has begun of the first 4-blade constant contact pressure fixture. prototype from Laser Mechanical. A manual switch has been installed for heater switching. This first prototype fixture was manufactured from MACOR. A second PEEK fixture is expected tomorrow. If prototype evaluations are successful, five more PEEK fixtures.will be fabricated.  Tobacco Substrate Studies:  Bright and burley dust samples are. being separated’ by mesh size (100 to <270' mesh). These samples will be used to prepare cast sheets to determine. the effect of particle size on sheet integrity and subjective character.  IR camera studies of glassy carbon heaters, coated with cast tobacco sheet using: Konjac flour as the adhesive, demonstrated that adhesion was maintained at heater temperatures up to 409 ° C. Continued modifications are being made to the binder system to increase the temperature threshold for adhesion failure. Samples of Konjac flour have been: submitted to Dr. Carchman for pyrolysis GC/MS analysis (300, 600 and 900° C).  MT Oriental’ strip has been cut and adhered to carbon: heater strips for baseline subjective evaluation. Two different high flavor, high alkaloid blend dusts (ca. 200 mesh): have been received from Flavor Development. These samples will be. sieved to separate into discreet mesh sizes for cast sheet preparation and subjective screening.  Miscellaneous:  The Karl Fischer titrator has been set up and is operational, permitting accurate moisture determination on heaters, cast sheets. and tobacco dust samples.  Assistance was provided to the Materials group to coat screen-printed ceramic heater prototypes with tobacco sheet for thermal evaluation. A calcium crosslinked Konjac flour adhesive system resisted sheet/heater delamination at temperatures >400:'° C'as measured by thermocouple (estimated >450 ° C actual). Further studies will be conducted to determine the surface properties of the screen-printed heaters.  A meeting was held with Bill Bell, Marshall Garrett and Bob Hale of Flavor Development to begin. consideration of flavor system development for the RTX prototype. Based on their initial subjective evaluation of prototypes containing Burley and Flue-Cured sheets, Bell! and Garrett are selecting flavor ingredients for subjective screenings beginning next week.

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  ne  Richmond, Virginia  To: B. Handy Date: November 1, 1989  From: N. Jensen Wey’  Subject: Mass Spectral Analysis of Residue from ART Pilot Plant  GC-MS analysis was performed on a sample of residue obtained from the reactor at the ART pilot plant. This sample was originally submitted by Jose Nepomuceno, request code 289095, sample code Z9DS. The sample was taken up in hexane and analyzed by GC-MS using the JEOL SX 102 mass spectrometer. A 15 meter, DB-5, 0.25 um column was used with conditions of initial temperature 100°C, heating rate of 10°/min., and final temperature of 325°C with a ten minute hold time. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode (EI) with 70 eV ionization potential, 10 Kev acceleration and a scan speed of 1 scan/sec over the mass range 0-800.  Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram for the sample. Important components include: hexane solvent (scan 67), neophytadiene (scan 516), (18,2E,4R, 7E,11E) -2,7,11-cembratriene-4, 6-diol (scan 746) and a number of long-chained hydrocarbons in the region of 950-1300. Although most of the components in the region of scan 950-1300 are long-chained hydrocarbon waxes, there are two notable exceptions. The first is the component observed at scan 1158 which has a structure that likely contains a substructure with aromatic character and an aliphatic chain. The second is the component observed at scan 1205 which appears to have a cholestane type structure. Absolute identification of these compounds has not been acheived.  Comparison of this material to ART materials analyzed previously reveals no components unique to this residue (see memo: Mass Spectral Analyses of ART Samples to D. Leyden, from N. Jensen 9/22/89). If one compares this material to solid material obtained as residue from higher pressure ART runs, the major difference is in relative distribution of various components. For this residue sample, the abundances of neophytadiene, the cembratrienediol and the cholestane type compound are increased with respect to the abundances of the hydrocarbons as compared to ART solid material analyzed previously. There are also some differences in relative distribution within the hydrocarbon region.  The total ion chromatogram for the sample is attached and mass spectra have been obtained for all components indicated in the TIC.

Am. Farm Bureau Holds 77th. Annual Convention  BOYDTON — The 77th annual Convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation was held at the Convention Center in Reno, Nevada, the week of January 7-il, 1996,  The activities began on Sunday when the Women’s and Young Farmer’s Programs were held.  The American Farm, Bureau  ‘Women announced that, through volunteer fund raising, the women had raised thirty thousand dollars in private funds to help build and make operational a fruit and vegetable canzing facility in the Western Ukraine. The check was presented during the meeting to the Citizens of Network for Foreign Affairs, The campaign was launched in Oc- tober 1994 and after ten Farm Bureau women spent three weeks in the Ukraine with the .C.N.F.A. Agribusiness Volunteer Program, . Money was donated by farm families across the U. S. and the project helped to reflect this year’s meeting | theme ‘‘Grasstoots to Global’’,  | In the “Young Farmer meeting, “the “discussion meet was held. yk oung frmers from many states  t “crigagaid i in ten rounds of discussions on previously assigned topics in an elimination process. The winner was Casey Niemann of Kansas and his prize was a new Dodge pickup truck. The A.F.B.F. Achievement Award went to Mike DeSutter of Il- linois. He was also the winner of a new Dodge pickup.  At the opening session, A.F.B.F. President Dean Kleckner gave an interesting and informative address, speaking to the 5,700-+ farmers and ranchers in attendance. :  ‘Kleckner serves on the National commission of Economic growth and,Tax reform which is chaired by  Jack Kemp. His question. was, “How Big Government and at what cost?’” His philosophy is: cut the  budget, stop spending, no new.  taxes, and spend within it’s means like all businesses and home owners must do. We need leaders with an understanding of budgeting.  Farm programs have been ‘“‘over- whelmed’* by the National Budget Debate, but Farm Bureau is calling for adequate financial support for agricultural research and market development programs. These pro- grams are agriculture’s future. Dollars: spent in these areas are returned many times over.  Last year the United States sold approximately $53- billion of agricultural goods to foreign buyers and ‘it is expected that this year’s sales will reach $58 billion, Farm Bureau will continue to work to ex- pand trade throughout. the world.  Kieckner also pledged that Farm Bureau will continue to seek proper- ty rights protection and. common sense reform of environmental regulations and the Endangered Species Act.  Kleckner stressed that. ‘cutting the capital gains tax rate, raising the Estate Tax exemption level, in- creasing the deductions of self employed health insurance, and providing enhanced depreciation schedules must remain tied to farm program approval as these measures will affect farmers in a positive manner,  The farmers and ranchers atten- ding the convention also heard talks by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Ed Madigan, Secretary of Ariculture, spoke to all county  presidents: in attendance at a lun- cheon on Monday.  Speed skater Bonnie Blair ad- ~  dressed the group on Tuesday..In .  her speech, she stressed ‘‘Set ‘ goals and be dedicated, have a balance in your life, and don’t be afriad to take tisks: These. three things apply to life no matter if you are a farmer, a speed skater or any: other profes sion in Which you are engaged."’ There were. conferences and workshops on many topics during the week, Some of these topics in- cluded Risk Management; Precision Farming, , Property Rights, Tax Reform, Dairy, Beef Cattle,  . Goverment Regulations, and other |  subjects. :  Delegates elected to the conven- tion from each state discussed and established Farm Bureau policy ¢ on a diverse ‘list of.j issues.  AF.BE. is ‘Organized in iy. states and Puerto Rico, and in more, , than 2,800,countries. There are more than four and a half million , , Farm Bureau members nationwide: Farin Bureau is. an independent, non-governmental, voluntary organization, of farm and ranch’ families,  NOOSE?

RJR CONFIDENTIAL       DISCRIMINATION [4        OTHER, LC]       SENSORY EVALUATION DIVISION ‘ L DESCRIPTIVE []  916 TEST REPORT NO. 7 ~ piacnostic § = []                       PROJECT: Flavored Triacetin Plasticizer Study - WINSTON Light 100 Box  TEST: Non-Menthol Discrimination               YEAR OF REPORT: 1987 NO. OF PAGES: 5.                  OBJECTIVE:        To determine if there is a perceptual difference between the current WINSTON Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype which has tow item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.               SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:           box material which had a high level of residual acetone. This product gave an “off" odor upon opening of the box. The Flavor Division recommends the addition of flavors to the WINSTON Light 100 Box tow item in order to mask high levels of residual acetone, should they occur in the product in the future.                      Discrimination results showed there was no perceptual difference between the current WINSTON Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype which has tow item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.            These results show that the addition of the flavorants will not change the perception of the WINSTON Light 100 Box product, but does not indicate whether or not the additional flavorants would mask any “off" odors caused by high levels of residual acetones.                 STATUS:           Sensory testing of the products was completed on September 14, 1987.          Brands Development and the Flavor Division are investigating the possibility of creating products with high level of residual ecetone, in order to "create the problem" again. Half of the prototypes made with high levels of residual acetone will have no flavorants added to the triacetin and the other half will have the flavorants added. These two prototypes will then be submitted for discrimination testing. The hypothesis being that if the added flavorants mask the "off" odor the products should be perceptually different. This test would then be followed up with descriptive testing in order to describe and quantify these differences.                                                       KEYWORDS:             triacetin, discrimination, WINSTON Light 100. Box, flavors, plasticizer, non-menthol, sensory evaluation           O2ZZE 8S90S __label__Report

So it is no coincidence that the tobacco giant: is pitching the new smoke: to con: sumers just: like de- caf. Packs of: Next carry we word “De- Nic’ beneath the: Next logo. The brand's ads proudly prociaum:. ‘“‘Intro- ducing. de-nicotined tobacco with rich flavor." And, of course; the copy.aiso tells consumers that the nicotine-removal. process is natural.  Philip Morris’s normally chatty tobacco PR people are still refusing to talk about the product or its positioning, even though! Next is being tested in Toledo, Ohio: Omaha, Neb.; and Hartford. Conn.. The:     :, Campaign, created' by Lee Burnett Co.. is:  appearing in local and national media in-:  -. cluding, regional editions of Time, News:  week and People.

Some industry critics warn the use of the word “de-nicotined” ts problematic scrutiny: At issue is: whether. consumers interpret it to mean no nicotine or 90 little  + nicotine that there are'so health risks is :.: volved. “This word is potentially misiesd:  * ing.” says Clif Douglas, assistant director  of the Coalition: on Smoking or Health.  “Some consumers will. consider. the prod- uct to be safe or safer than other tobacco products."  tho fact.

Issue - Current Considerations  Currently SR's/RR’s report in-stock or OOS on Region designated brand styles resulting in: - Limited measures which provide little or no actionable information  - Inconsistent brand style tracking prevents chain, area, national rollup/views  - Current report is measured as % of doors - thereby assuming all accounts are equal  - Current report does not identify conditions/problems nor does it provide degree or extent of conditions  Objective  The objective of the revised product availability reporting procedures is to provide better measures and more actionable information on product availability at retail.  Action Steps for revised product availabllity reporting procedures.  1) Begin to track/monitor OOS at retail on dur top 20 national brand styles and region identified market opportunity brand styles effective August 26, 1996. (We will place the top 20 brand styles in SIS here in Winston-Salem...see attached list.)  - SR’s/RR’s will continue to report OOS at retail but with brand style focused on identified national and market place business needs. No change in reporting other than the number and selection of brand styles.  2) Each region must provide a list of brand styles (suggest no more than 5 to 10 - if any at all) that you would like to measure that are not included in the national top 20 brand styles.  Note to RSM's/RBM's: Piease submit these brand styles by Region to your respective AMO and they will ensure placement in SIS for August 26, 1996 effective date -  Respond to AMO week of August 19, 1996.     9Lezt 66LTS __label__Report

USA Vol. 87, pp. 6208-6212, August 1990 Biochemistry  Purification and partial characterization of a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced protein kinase of M, 68,000 from  influenza virus-infected cells  (protein kinase /influenza /eukaryotic initiation factor 2/translation, /interferon)  Tar Gvu Lee*, Jupy Tomira*, ARA G. HovaNesstANnt, AND MICHAEL G. Katze*t  *Department of Microbiology, School af Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; and “Unite d’Oncologie Virale, Institut Pasteur,  Paris 75724, France  Communicated by Edwin G. Krebs, May 21, 1990  ABSTRACT A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon- induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (re- ferred to as P68 based on its Af, of 68,000 in human cells). This control is essential because once activated, the P68 kinase phosphorylates its natural substrate, the a subunit of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), limiting functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 avail- able for protein synthesis initiation, We have previously shown that influenza virus encoded a specific mechanism to repress the autophosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitro assays for P68 inhibition, we now have purified, to near homogeneity, the P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected cells. The purified product inhibited both the autophosphory- lation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the a subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase. We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surpris- ingly we found the purified repressor, which had an apparent M, of ~58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein. Possible mechanisms by which influenza virus activates this cellular regulator of the protein kinase, thereby minimizing potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.     To avoid decreases in protein synthetic rates during infec- tion, animal viruses have devised strategies to downregulate activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA- activated protein kinase (referred to as P68 from its M, of 68,000 but also referred to by others as DAI or Pl/elP-2 kinase) (1-4). The P68, a serine/threonine kinase, is charac- terized by two distinct kinase activities: the first involves an autophosphorylation (activation) reaction, and the second involves a protein kinasc activity on exogenous substrates (5, 6). The virus-induced contro! of P68 is essential because viral-specific RNAs synthesized during infection have the potential to activate the P68 kinase (7-11). Once activated, P68 phosphorylates its natural substrate, the @ subunit of protein synthesis eukaryotic initiation factor 2, e1F-2. Phos- phorylation of the efF-2 a subunit blocks the ell*-2B- mediated exchange of GDP in the inactive eIF-2-GDP com- plex with GTP required for catalytic utilization of eLP-2 (12-14}, These events lead to limitations in functional elF-2, which is an essential component of protein synthesis initia- tion and is normally required to bind initiator Mct-tRNA (via the ternary complex eI F-2-GTP_-Met-tRNA) to the initiating ribosomal subunit before MRNA is bound (14).  The regulation of P68 is best understood in the adenovirus system primarily because of the characterization of the adenovirus mutant 4/331 (16). During infection by the di331  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

In contrast to adenovirus, both reovirus and vac- cinia viruses appear to downregulate P68 by encoding gene products that may bind to and sequester the double-stranded RNA activator of the kinase (23-25). Poliovirus has devised yet another strategy to minimize the damaging effects of kinase activation: early after virus infection the kinase is significantly degraded (7). Finally, we recently have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 may mediate downregulation of the protein kinase via action of the raz gene product (26).  The first indication that influenza virus encoded mecha- nisms to regulate P68 came from studies analyzing cells doubly infected with influenza virus and the adenovirus mutant di331. When mutant di331-infected cells were super- infected with influenza virus, dramatic suppression of the protein kinase activity normally detected during mutant infection was observed (27). We then reported a similar suppression of kinase activity in cells infected by influenza virus alone (28). In the present report we describe the purification and characterization of an unusual P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected ceils. The inhibitor, which was purified by using in vitro P68 inhibition assays, was unex- pectedly found to be a cellular and not a viral protein.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cells and Virus. The Madin—Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (29) and the adenovirus type 5 human embryonic cell line 293 (30) were grown in monolayers as described (28). The WSN strain of influenza virus was grown and titrated as earlier described (29).  Purification of the P68 Inhibitor. Monolayers of MDBK cells (2 x 10" cells; 800 T150 flasks) were infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of ~10 plaque-forming units per cell for 4 hr. The infected cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution and lysed in buffer A: 50 mM Tris‘HCl, pH 7.5/50 mM KCI/1 mM dithiothreitol/2 mM MgCl./aprotinin at 100 zg per ml/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1% Triton X-100. The cyto- plasmic extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor.

- PHILIP MORRIS MANAGEMENT CORP.  TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  Thomas J. Collamore pate:: April 21, 1995 James C. Botticelli  Alan Blum  It is somewhat difficult to give you anything definitive that Blum may bring up at the shareholders meeting, but I'l attempt a stab.  He's rather mercurial in his style, so he really can come up with anything. In the past, he has not been as combative as some of the other anti's (certainly not like the Connolly's, Slade's et al), and tries to come across as a "good" guy, often complimenting PM on its hospitality in Richmond, etc. I find him more an irritant, attempting to embarrass us, than, say, the institutional shareholders, who are pushing for dramatic change. This will be his seventh annual meeting.  He founded the group Doctors Ought to Care (DOC). It's a national physicians’ anti-tobacco group that is especially fond of protesting tobacco-sponsored sporting groups. It targeted Virginia Slims Tournament one year, calling it Emphysema Slims. DOC has been trying to bring in religious allies to its cause.  Blum likes to twist or exaggerate things. He has accused us of suborning the minority community. For example, he said the reason Blacks rarely criticized the tobacco industry on smoking and health issues was because we were “buying them off’ with our charitable contributions. Blum was also the person who, just before the 1992 Republican Convention, released our internal memoranda regarding political contributions. At the time he tried to embarrass us by saying that we are "buying" politicians with our PAC support and that Craig, as Convention Chairman, is further evidence of how we get to politicians. If we support a youth organization, he'll say our ulterior motive is really to get kids to smoke, or, if we sponsor a promotion, he'll say we are really trying to circumvent restrictions on TV advertising.  As far as I can recall, he has never put forward a shareholder resolution, but has seconded or commented on many others. We reviewed the transcripts of the past several years' annual meetings, and he has seconded or commented on the following resolutions - economic conversion (1994), cigarette advertising (1993), global warning labels (1993/91), marketing of Miller beer (1992/91), cigarettes and minors (1990). This year, I suspect he may be interested in Proposal 2 - ETS; maybe 3, primarily because it attempts to get us out of the tobacco business; and 5, economic conversion, since he seconded last year.

Moreover, ADT alone was able to increase, in BSO-untreated mice, the liver cytosol reduced glutathione content.

ate PHILIP MORRIS, U. S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  0 “Ut Ong To: S. Darrah Date: January 2H Key, 4S From: A. Dixon “Ap  Subject: CAPITAL APPROPRIATION REQUEST ~- WEL CLEAN-UP SYSTEM - PARK 500  Attached is an Appropriation Request for $172,000 capital and $3,000 retirement expense to upgrade the weak extracted liquor (WEL) system on Line III at Park 500. This proposal will improve the facilities yield by reducing the amount of rich brown water (RBW) discharged to Waste Water Treatment.  In the RL process, foreign material is removed from incoming tobacco through a tramp material eliminator and high density Cleaners. These devices utilize fresh water as the separation and cleaning medium. By converting the separation medium from water to WEL, additional RBW can be utilized.  Weak extracted liquor is the RL process filtrate from the second pressing operation. It is re-input for dilution in the Line III blending wet slurry and the stock preparation steps. If more of the WEL stream is used in the blend preparation, an additional amount of the RBW stream can be used as process dilution in stock preparation. RBW is the filtrate from the Machine Room, the excess of which is discharged to Waste Treatment.  The WEL recycle stream will have to be upgraded to use it as a separation fluid; tobacco fibers must be removed and the stream heated. Heating the WEL will ensure control of microbiological activity. Implementation of this proposal will accomplish both requirements and hence allow 387,696 pounds of tobacco to be saved annually (Attachment 1). This project has an ROI of 19.2% and a payback period of 4.9 years by avoiding scrap tobacco purchases.  This project was included in the 1990 Third Revised Capital  Forecast for $250,000 and was not included in the 1990-1994 Five Year Plan.  /dw ‘ d99.doc  2050062998 __label__Memo

As first proposed about three years ago by Dr. Earl P, Benditt, of the Uni- versity of Washington. Seatue, the ides suggests that cell proiferation is first iniieted by some. chemical. biological or physical sumulys and thai the grow- ing mass is then built up into an etber- osclerotic plaque as it is invaded by fibnnogen, Gpoproteins and otber bicod components. The theory was bated on his observations thal sthero- sclerotic plaques from the sorties of three women all contained only a sin- gle form of two possible forms of tbe enryme glucose-6-phosphete debydro- genase, indicating that the atlero- sclerotic tissue must have come from only one cell population. Dr. Benditt, cheirman of the FASEB symposium, seid  August 18, 1976  Confirmed st Haphine  His work has since been confirmed by Di. Rober H. Heptenstatl. of the Johns Hopkins University Schoo) of Medicine, who told © press conference that Dr. Benditt's finding is “one of the most signibcpot observations tbe!

Pre- sumebly these initistors ere carticd to smooth muscle cells in the arterial walls by blood components, stch as lisoproteins, he said.  For example, be reported laboratory evidence thet 3-rmethyl cholanthrene, B precarcinogenic mutagen found in cigarette supoke and lipoproteins from human serum ase carned in the same portion of the serum as is cholesterol.  “it bas now been observed in sev- eral laboratories that low density Lipo- proteins, among the serum proteins, are preferentially taken up by tbe smooth muscle cells derived trom bu- men and primate eniery walls wheo culivated in vitro,” Dr. Benditt said.

‘ We sermemarte oe  TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT:     THE COMBINED ROLE OF TOBACCO SMOKE CONDENSATES, AVITAMINOSTS AND ALCOHOL IN THE ETIOLOGY OF ORAL CANCER  INTRODUCTION :     During the past twelve years IT, as well as many of my colleagues, have observed that a large percentage of patients afflicted with oral cancer illicited histories of excessive tobacco smoking, concomitant abuse of alcoholic beverages and diets deficient in essential protein and vitamins. It is theoretically possible that the dietary deficiency cowld condition the oral tissues or be a predisposing factor en- abling the carcinogen present in the tobacco condensate to induce the development of a cancerous process. The role of alcohol may be that of a synergistic direct irritant, or indirectly by its action on the liver to effect degenerative changes leading to cirrhosis; thus impairing an important immune center of the body.  Experimently, it is the purpose of this project to induce in laboratory animals  (white mice) cancer of the oral tissues by combining the factors, tobacco condensates,  alcohol, and dietary deficiencies.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE :     Six groups of white mice, each group to consist of ten mice will be subjected to variations of tobacco application, alcohol and diet. A control group will be in- cluded. The tobacco condensate will be diluted in 50% acetone and will be painted  on the oral mucosa four times weekly. The alcohol will be placed in the drinking water of the animals and changed completely four times weekly. A 10% solution of a standard brand of whiskey will be used. The diets, when deficient, will be re~ stricted in Vit. "A", "B" complex and "OC".  ANTMAL GROUPS:     Group I The oral mucosa will be painted on the same gite with the tobacco condensate.  Aleohol will be added to the water. The diet will be deficient in Vitamins  HA, Ep and ncn, __label__Report

It may also present in the familiar distal form and also as a scroncgative spondyl- arthritis, and sometimes as both. At the moment, there~ fore, there is enough evidence for us to accept psoriatic arthritis as an entity distinct and apart from rheumatoid arthritis, even though the manifestations are often similar or identical and even though paticnts with classical rheumatoid arthritis may also have coexistent psoriasis. Patients with psoriatic arthritis should by definition be scroncgative and free from rheumatoid nodules. By splitting this disorder off from rheumatoid arthritis much more has been Jearnt about it, a5 these workers have clearly shown.  “Barber, HS, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseater, 1957, 16, 230.  * Gibberd, FB, Acts Rheumarclogica Scandinavica, 1905, 31, 62.  ® Vilanova, X, and Pinol, J, Xhcumacesra, 1951, 7, 197.  4 Wright, V, Annals of the Rhcumatie Diseases, 1956, 15, 348.  ® Coste, F, et al, Revue du Rhumatusme et des Maladies Ostéo-Articulaircs, 1958, 25, 75. ae  Roberts, MET, et al, Annals of the Rheumaue Diseases, 1976, 35, 206.  * Read, W B, Heiskell, C L, and Becker, SW, Archives of Dermatology, 1961, 83, 653. .  © Weight, V, Anials of the Rhewmatre Diseases, 1961, 20, 123.  ® Wright, V, Stutrock, R D, and Dick, W C, in Recent Advances in Rheumet- clogy, Part 2, eds W' W Buchanan and W C Dick, p 193.

Fetal breathing was depressed with the tobacco Cigarette and slightly less so with the nicotine chewing-gum. A more recent study has confirmed that fetal breathing move~ ments are reduced in association with cigarette smoking in normal and abnormal pregnancies." The reduction was related to the cise in maternal plasma nicotine levels. Non- nicotine (herbal) cigarettes produced similar rises in carboxy- hacmoglobin to those caused by tobacco cigarcttes but without a reduction in. fetal breathing. These studies are helpful in dissociating the influence of nicotine from that of . carbon monoxide in regard to this particular effect.

The lowered appetite which is a recognised concomitant of smoking may be responsible for a lower maternal calorific intake and hence tower fetal weight, but a review of the evidence in 1973 did not suggest that this mattered.’ Since then, however, other workers have suggested that impaired gain in maternal weight may be of importance."!

But smoking in pregnancy presents a special case. Firstly, it is a danger to the child as well as to the mother. Secondly, since pregnancy is of limited duration a woman who cannot be persuaded to give up smoking may actept a substitute at least while she is pregnant. It would be an advance if her craving . gould be met by a cigarette free from dangers to the babv. Accordingly, workers have tried to identify whe harmful components of tobacco smoke.  Carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cyanides are the factors which seem most likely to have ill effects on the fetus, Studics of carbon monoxide! ? have indicated that the inctease in carboxyhacmoglobin may deprive the fetus ofadequate oxygen. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the type of baby liable to be harmed by the mother’s smoking is the one already at risk for some other reason. Nevertheless, analysis of vesttiol excretion levels has suggested that hypoxia is not the main influence on retardation of fetal growth.

Smoking is best stopped before conception, but there is evidence that stopping in the first two months of pregnancy reduces the hazard.? Encouraging the mother to increase her food intake may be worth trying, burexcessive weight gain may be harmful, and at present a controlled trial of this approach seems called for.'® It is mothers in the lower social classes and with a poor obstetric performance whose babies are particularly at risk from smoking, and they might well be guided to special clinics so that maximal effort could be concentrated on them.

These substrates; alumina, bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black (carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes should result in decreased carbon monoxide and decomposition products.  Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021" diameter  wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8" wide x 60 mm long.  GO        o. 0. 07s — 08S  Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at a temperature near the boiling point.

Sent: Thursday, July 01, 1999 8:59 AM To: Ittermann, Patti F.  Subject: ABC Reminder  In the April ABC newsletter the front page article was about the development of a Newspaper Reader Profile Service. Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Profile Service was to enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country.  You had asked me to remind you about this study in carly July so you could check on it when you attended the ABC meeting this month. I thought it might be interesting to get the results of the carly test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to market, especially given the availability of other "news" sources from market to market. A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 21-29 might be forced to read the daily newspaper to learn about club events, ctc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your memory - let me know and i'll give it to you.  joan  RJRO00000166 7034526 70030 2746  S869 e6ecs __label__Email

Recent work by an inter. nationally known epidemiolo- nist suggests that “ detection  , bias" in a variety of studies  | may. just possibly have pro-  'ducy a “falsely high  ‘ass... .iion” between smok- ing ana lung cancer.  Dr Alvin R. Feinstein, Pro-  fessor of Medicine and Epi- cemiology at Yale University, suys that if his findings of such “bias” in a study of more than 1,300 lung cancer patients are confirmed for the seneral population of smok- ers and nonsmokers, “we may have to reappraise some _of the statistical rezscning that has hitherto been used to form causal conclusicns " about smoking as a carcino cen,  The findings were based on a retrospective restudy of data on all patients (1,331) with a diagnosis of primary ‘uag cancer at Yale-New Haven Hospital and West Haven Veterans Administra- ven Hospital during 1953- WeG4,  The first clue to the exist- cnce of a possihly unrecog- nsed bias came with a “ necropsy surprise". Of 654 Patients examined post mor- tum lang cancer had been uns cted beforehand in 12, ue 16 per cent.  Further study showed that “nondiagnosis during life " was highest among those matlents (37 per cent) whose     Medical News Reporter  history of cigarette smoking was unknown.  “The rate of nordiagnosis,” Dr. Feinstein said, “had a dis- tinctive downward gradient, going from 37 per cent unde- tected among the non-cigar- ette smokers to 20 per cent among the light smokers; 14  rcentin the moderate; and 0 and 12 per cent in the heavy and extreme smckers.  “There was a similar gra- dient, but with Jarcer denomi- hators, for the rate of non- diagnosis in the entire case sores, rather than in the nec- ropsy group alonc.  “The cata therefore sug- gested that the more paticnis snwked, the more likely they were to have lung cancer de- tected during life.”  He and his colleague, Dr.’  Carolyn K.

But within each category of cough the “search rates went up in relation to the amount of smoking.”  Among patients with no cough the search rate rose from 46 per cent in the no- smoking troup to 59 per cent among light or moderate smo- kers and to 64 per cent in the  heavy or extreme smoking group.  Among patients with chro- nic cough there was an “analgous gradient,” Dr. Fein- stein reports, ranging from 53 to 81 to 85 per cent. In patients with a recent cough, the search rate went from 64 to 80 to 84 per cent in the respective groups.  The Pap smear search rate, he added, was lower in pa- tients with disseminated can- cer than in those with distant metastases, “but in both Clinical stayes, the gradient of search increased with higher amounts of smoking.”  In a Metical News inter- view, Dr. Feinstein acknow- ledged that he was question- ing “one of the icons” of modern statistics; but he Stressed that the operative word was “ * questioning,’ not *atlacking’."" “The data we have are suitable for rsising questions, not for launching an attack,” he said.     jo ¢, “ s - ¢ , < 2 a z 1 oO N S. __label__News

Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA . Vol. 91, pp. 772-776, January 1994 . Medical Sciences  An integral membrane protein (LMP2) blocks reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus from latency following surface  immunoglobulin crosslinking  Cyerye L. MILER, JENNIFER H. Lee, ELLiott Kierr*, AND RICHARD LONGNECKERT  Departments of Medicine and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis S$:reet, Boston, MA 02115  Communicated by Peter M. Howley, October 8, 1993 (received for review August 30, 1993)  ABSTRACT The role of latent membrane protein 2 (LMP?) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) infection was evaluated by using latently infected primary B lymphocytes that had been growth transformed by wild-type or specifically mutated EBV recombinants. LMP2 null mutant recombinant EBV-infected cells were similar to normal B lymphocytes in their rapid increase in intracellular free calcium after surface immuno- globulin crosslinking. These cells also became more permissive for lytic EBV replication. In sharp contrast, wild-type control infected cells had little or no increase in intracellular free calcium or in permissivity for EBV replication. The bleck to surface immunoglobulin crosslinking-induced permissivity in cells expressing wild-type LMP2 could be bypassed by raising intracellular free catcium levels with an ionophore and by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate. LMP2A, not LMP2B, mediates this effect on calcium mobilization. Genetic and biochemical data are consistent with these effects being due to the interaction of the LMP2A N-terminal cytoplasmic domain with B lymphocyte sre family tyrosine kinases.     Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that establishes latency in B lymphocytes during primary infection. Latent infection of B lymphocytes is likely to be essential for perpetuation of this virus in human populations, since virus reactivation from latency is the major reservoir of virus for infection of susceptible hosts. In latent infection, the virus can express six nuclear proteins [EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs)], two integral membrane proteins [latent mem- brane proteins (LMPs)}, and two small RNAs, thereby caus- ing proliferation of the infected lymphocyte (1-3). Latently infected lymphocytes can cause a lymphoproliferative dis- ease in immunodeficient individuals (4-6). The EBNAs and LMPs are being intensively studied since they are likely to be involved in the maintenance or regulation of latency or of the concomitant effects on cell proliferation. This report focuses on LMP2, the protein(s) most recently discovered to be expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes (7-9).  Two forms of LMP2 (designated LMP2A and -2B) are expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes. Both forms are encoded by highly related mRNAs composed of eight exons with a single long open reading frame, differing only in their first exons (10-12). The first exon of LMP2A encodes a 119-amino acid hydrophilic N terminus that is unique to LMP2A. The promoter for LMP2B is in the first LMP2A intron, and the first LMP2B exon is noncoding. The first codon of the second exon in LMP2A and -2B is a methionine codon, at which translation of LMP2B initiates. That methi- onine is followed by 12 predicted hydrophobic transmem- brane domains separated by short reverse turns and a 27-  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

LMP2A and -2B posttranslationally insert into membranes (12).  Although initial biochemical evidence pointed to an im- portant role for LMP2 in cell growth transformation, EBV recombinants with mutations affecting any part of LMP2 are fully competent for inducing B-lymphocyte transformation and the transformed cells are indistinguishable from wild type (WT) in growth in vizro or in severe combined immunodefi- ciency (scid) mice (13), (C.L.M., R.L., and E.K., unpub- lished data). Nevertheless, LMP2A does associate with LMP1 in latently infected cell plasma membranes (14), and LMP1 is a key effector of EBV-induced cell growth trans- formation (15-20). Furthermore, LMP2A patches in the plasma membrane are major sites of tyrosine phosphoryla- tion, and LMP?2A is associated with, and tyrosine phosphor- ylated by, B-lymphocyte sre family tyrosine kinases (14, 21).  The experiments described in this report were designed to test the hypothesis that a key role of LMP? in interacting with src-related tyrosine kinases is to block transmembrane signal transduction in latently EBV-infected lymphocytes and thereby prevent fortuitous activation of lytic infection. Three previous lines of evidence are consistent with this hypothe- sis. First, crosslinking of surface immunoglobulin (slg) can activate a switch to lytic replication in a few latently EBV- infected cell lines (22, 23). The cell line in which crosslinking of sIg can most efficiently induce such effects is a Burkitt lymphoma cell tine in which LMP2 is not expressed (24). Second, expression of LMP2A in Burkitt tumor lymphoblasts at the level normally seen in latently infected ceils blocks the calcium mobilization response to crosslinking of slg, CD19, or major histocompatibility complex class II (25). Finally, LMP2aA interacts with src family tyrosine kinases, which are key effectors of sig-mediated B-lymphocyte activation (26). We now present evidence that LMP2A blocks the effects of slg crosslinking on calcium mobilization and reactivation of EBV from latent infection in growth-transformed normal human B lymphocytes.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell Lines and Cell Culture. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established by infecting normal human B tym- phocytes with either WT or LMP2 mutant recombinant EBV (13, 27, 28). LCLs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (2 u2/ml). Akata is a membrane IgG-positive Burkitt lymphorna cell line.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  As part of its overall strategy to compete with savings brands, DORAL has been using coupons to be competitively priced with private label brands. However, since coupons do not always reach all target adult smokers, the brand is considering revising its pricing strategy to an everyday price of $.30 below full- priced brands.  The issue has been raised about the effect of this change in pricing strategy on the image of DORAL, specifically would this everyday pricing strategy cheapen brand image.  Research has been proposed to determine the effect of this change in pricing Strategy on the image of DORAL. The specific objectives of the research would be to determine the effect of dropping the price below that of full-priced brands on:  e Interest in the brand  e Image of the brand, and  e image of the brand user.

be  i 4  a  @ BOOK IT  Buist - U. of Oregon ~ #1044  The role of alpha, antitrypsin deficiency as a risk factor in the development of chronic airways obstruction.  The investigator's specific aim is to examine the role of alpha antitrypsin (a, AT) deficiency as a risk factor in the development of  chronic airway obstruction. The hypotheses to be tested are that  a) MZ heterozygote for a,AT deficiency has impaired lung function as measured by a wide range of tests of lung mechanics and  b) the MZ heterozygote does not belong to the high risk category for the development of chronic airway obstruction unless there is an  additive factor such as smoking, pollutants etc.  In view of the unusual population available and her expertise, I recommend continuation at high priority.

MEMORANDUM  April 7, 1976 TO: George Tel ford J FROM: Larry outude A RE: TRUE "QUIT" CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS  I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data for True "Quit" ads tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads tested ran during May, 1975 and February, 1976, and included the original | Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to  be useful.  This memo will:  1) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the ‘reasons for success or failure.  Listed below is a re-cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad. Also listed are average smoker scores for all cigarette ads (including True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi-Fi brands (excluding True) run in the test issues. Initial True scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True "Quit" ads have consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi ads throughout the campaign.

Vol. 14, No. 1, 1964 BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS  . 1 NUCLEAR RIBOSOMES, AN EARLY FACTOR IN TISSUE HKEPARATION  Se Gudbjexnason and C. De Schryver Department of Medicine  Wayne State University College of Medicine and Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan  Receaved October 16, 1963  The role of cytoplasmic ribosomes in protein synthesis has been studied extensively in the past; more recent discoveries suggest (NolLA et al, 1963) that the functional units or protein synthesis are ribosomal aggregates, "ergosomes", consisting of particles held together by m-RNA. The origin of cytoplasmic ribosomes is a matter of some speculation but a current favorite is thet ribosomal RNA is synthesized in the nucleus.  The purpose of our report is to present some data which indicate that nuclear ribosomes are labeled earlier than cytoplasmic microsomes during tissue reparation, suggesting nuclear origin of the cytoplasmic microsomes. The studies were carried out on subcellular fractions of infarcted and normal cardiac muscle.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Myocardial infarction was produced in dogs by ligation of  branches of the anterior descending coronary artery, so that a homo~- geneous infarct was obtained. Glycine-2-cl4 (specific activity 15.1 mc/mMol) was injected  intravenously, 30 gic per kg body weight. The animals were sacrificed     2 this work was supported by Grant No. H-5043 from the U.S. Public Health Service, The American Heart Association, The Michigan Heart Association, Life Insurance Medical Research Fund, Tobacco Industry  Research Committee, The Burroughs-welicome Fund, and The John A.» Hartford Foundation.  12  PUBLICATIONS 004251 __label__Scientific

Since there appears to be a trend toward increasing body weight in male adylts below the age of 45, this raises the question as to whether the weight gained by former amokers is attributable to smoking cessation or is an effect of aging.  Unfortunately many of the studies that have examined the relationship of smoking cessation to weight gain have foeused on cross-sectionaldata."" An analysis based on longitudinal data, the Comatock and Stone study," confounds the problem by using 8 re- stricted age range (40 to 60 years) and by not having controlled for the fact that men (undifferentiated for amoking habita) below the age of 45 years tend to gain weight as they get older.

It takes teamwork to prevent cigarette sales to minors.  Preventing cigarette sales to minors is not a job anyone can do alone. We all have a role to play in this effort—-parents, teachers, store owners, state and local officials and, of course, tobacco companies.  At Philip Morris USA, we're teaming up with retailers, wholesalers and other major tobacco manufacturers in support of an ambitious program. called “We Card.” It is providing stores across the country with signs and educational materials to promote awareness of minimum-age laws and the importance of checking ID.  We're also supporting the passage of state legislation to better enforce existing minimum-age laws.  What can you do to help? Become familiar with your state’s minimum-age laws. Don’t buy  cigarettes for minors. And don’t send minors to buy cigarettes for you. Teamwork can make the difference.  wii a) 2501030007 PHILIP MORRIS U.  Action Against Access. __label__Advertisement

Lethe,  TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  TO: Valerie Vaughan FROM: Don Kisling DATE: November 3, 1999  SUBJECT: PROMOTIONS - True Carton Cash Continuity Program        Please find attached the latest topline review of the True Carton Cash Continuity Program from October 11th through October 22". Also find included the response analysis chart.  The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October 22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.  Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True filter packings and 10% from Menthol. Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.  Also find enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual response. You will see that the actual response through October 224 (21,418) has already surpassed the October projection (21,215).  Upon your review of these reports, please contact me with any questions or if additional information is required.  DK/bh  CC: G. Baroody A. Pasheluk G. Telford S. Benson J. Young 8S. Smith J.

VINSON* and CHI HSU DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY UNIVERSITY OF SCRANTON  SCRANTON, PA 18510 U.S.A.  in vitro lipid peroxidation of red blood cells has been studied using high glucose (55.5 mM) in the media to stimulate lipid peroxidation. Vitamins A, C and E in a natural matrix and a citrus extract reduced lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactivity. A human supplementation study was done in which it was shown that natural vitamin Cc containing ascorbic acid and citrus extract significantly elevated lipid peroxidation in both plasma and urine. Citrus extract alone decreased plasma lipid peroxidation. Natural vitamin A and E decreased both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation. A  combination of natural vitamins A, E and citrus extract was the  most effective supplement resulting in more than a 30% decrease in both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation.  Key words: lipid peroxidation, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, citrus extract, thiobarbituric acid INTRODUCTION  Oxygen, though necessary for life, is a toxic substance. Fortunately, 98% of the oxygen is completely reduced to water in the process of respiration. The other 2% turns into potentially toxic free radical oxidants?. ‘These substances can damage proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. They can also directly reduce the level of the antioxidant defense molecules in the plasma, Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation has been implicated in several disease states including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, postischemic  reoxygenation injury, as well as in the degenerative processes  *ro whom inquiries should be addressed.  50579881 __label__Scientific

'2458-93-29650  MEMORANDUM  March 26, 1993 MINIMUM SALES AGE FOR CIGARETTES IN PENNSYLVANIA  This memorandum responds to the February 18, 1993 letter from Richard A. Lewis, District Attorney for Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, to Ernest D. Preate, Jr., Attorney General of Pennsylvania, in which Mr. Lewis requests that the attorney General issue a formal opinion addressing the minimum sales age for cigarettes in Pennsylvania. Mr. Lewis suggests that  Pennsylvania law prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons  under the age of 21. He notes that Section 6306 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6306, prohibits the sale of cigarettes to "any minor," and that the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. C.Ss.  § 1991, defines a "minor" as "an individual under the age of 21  years."  In fact, the minimum sales age for cigarettes has been 18 since 1990, when Section 6305 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6305, was amended to raise the minimum sales age for “tobacco, in any form," from 16 to 18. The minimum sales age for cigarettes, as for other tobacco products, previously was 16, as  specified in Section 6305 prior to the 1990 amendment.  The District Attorney's reliance on the Statutory  Construction Act is misplaced. That Act itself provides that the  definitions contained in Section 1991 apply only when the context  does not "clearly indicate[ ] otherwise." 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991; see  800881992 __label__Memo
To: from:  Subject:  ) PHILIP MORRIS U. Se de  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Mr. J. D. Schardt pate: June 14, 1985  G. D. Keritsis  PM CASE 641 DIVISION III  Craig in U.S. Patent 2,583,548 teaches the treatment of cellulosic pulp containing 1% to 6% of fibers with an excessive amount (10%) of a calcium chloride solution which gives a salt to fiber dry weight ratio from 1.6/7 to 10; causing the pulp containing the calcium chloride to a prolonged mechanical treatment, and then adding a soluble salt such as sodium carbonate to react with the calcium chloride to form a precipitated calcium compound pigment.  Our case (Serial No. 519,619) differs from that of Craig in that the  cellulosic pulp is caused to swell and hydrate by chemical means by react-  ing the cellulosic pulp with the ammonium and/or alkali metal hydroxides which in addition force the polyvalent metal ions to be fixed in the  cellulosic matrix either as a water insoluble precipitate or as a "salt" of the cellulosic matrix. Both of these mechanisms of precipitating or fixing metalic ions uniformly in the cellulosic matrix are probably  responsible for altering the combustion of the cellulosic substrate and  for improving the subjective character of smoke. The required amounts  of precipitated or fixed metal ions needed to achieve this effect is significantly lower than that practiced by Craig for a different purpose (in our case the ratio of salt to cellulosic material is less than 0.4).  Briskin, et. al., (U.S. Patent 3,640,285) deals with the treatment of cigarette paper containing calcium or magnesium or strontium or barium oxalate, pivalate, tannate. This paper could be produced by treating an existing cigarette paper containing calcium carbonate with oxalic acid or pivalis or tannic, or by adding the desired salt to the cellulosic pulp used in the original formation of the paper web (see column 2 lines 65-69).  In this case, Briskin teaches the selection of one salt over another for  a cigarette paper and his method of treatment in no way teaches or makes obvious the treatment of cellulosic material with hydroxides of ammonium and/or alkalies to uniformly fix a polyvalent metal cation to the celluto- sic matrix. In column 2 lines 37-38 “The oxalic acid solution operates to convert calcium carbonate to insoluble calcium oxalate." We do not see any  relation in this statement to those of ours since Briskin converts one insoluble salt, CaC03, to another insoluble salt, calcium oxalate, and  according to his earlier statement, column 2 lines 65-69 it does not make a difference whether the oxalate is added to the paper at the pulping section in place of calcium carbonate or is formed by treating the paper containing  the carbonate with oxalic acid. As a result our invention is in'no way  similar or obvious from the Briskin teachings. Also, it is claimed in Claim  1 that one of the anions that could be used to form the calcium salt is "“Yactic acid" which forms calcium lactate with a very good solubility in water! ,     £SSU8SS8202 __label__Memo

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.  Inter Office Correspondence                  TO: Distribution DATE: June 8, 1994  FROM: Jim Maggio  SUBJECT: Revi Incremental Production Costs/Paper to Vinyl  The attached details the revised incremental "production" costs associated with a conversion to vinyl for the various PM bulletin pools. The additional costs for transportation and art (less separation savings) are now included. Importantly, costs have actually declined slightly for the Corporate pool versus those presented on Monday, while Marlboro costs  have increased nominally.  Separation charges, which average $5,000 per design, will be eliminated when converting to vinyl production. The savings applies only to the Corporate pool, given that Marlboro separation charges were included in the Marcann paper printing costs. As a result, minor increases in transportation costs due to heavier weight for vinyl was more than offset by significant savings due to the elimination of separation charges for the Corporate pool. Below is a breakdown of the revised incremental costs per unit per cycle for both pools.  .. INCREMENTAL COSTS/U NIT/CY CLE  Marlboro ~ Original Revised 14x 48 $ 78 $ 90  20 x 60 281 312 Corporate  19.6 x 48 119 101  20 x 60 69 - 282  Note that it is now cost effective to produce the 20 x 60 Corporate pool on vinyl vs. paper !  Fiscal 1994 and full year '95 revised incremental production costs for vinyl are outlined on the attached. Total incremental Marlboro pool production costs for fiscal 1994 totals $57,000 while the Corporate pool totals an incremental $21,000 for fiscal '94 (or $5m per  brand for the 4 cycles).  Assuming brand approval, we will proceed with the conversion effective with the November posting for Virginia Slims in the Corporate pool and for Marlboro in the 14 x 48 and 20 x 60 pools. We will also coordinate viewing for the vinyl/paper “test” which will be available for viewing in Maspeth, Queens during the  week of June 27th.  GASLVEO90S __label__Memo

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 1994 BAL     Exposure to Workplace Tobacco Smoke Is Greater Than Believed, Study Says  By Trmorsy oar Staff Reporcer of Tax Wau. Srtmer JovRNAL WASHINGTON — Passive smake in the workplace might be a much bigger health danger than U.S. Workers have been led to halieve, according fo a new government study. The new findings come from the Cen- ters for Disease Control, and appear in a  Hearts and Wallets at Odds Iva wilikely that sither individuals or ‘mutual funds will be able to kek the habit of investing in tobacen companice, Fund Track, page C1.  special issue of the Journal of the Ameri- catt Medical Association on the heaith impacts of tobacco, At a news conference yesterday te publicize the journal’s re- search, AMA officials urged investors to avoid 13 stocks and 1,474 mutual funds that invest in tobacco manufacturing. The AMA Shed {ts own tobacco holdings in 1986.  The passive-sinoke findings represent fhe most extensive data ever compiled on nonsinokers’ exposure to cigarette smoke in the U.S. The new information will likely add ballast to antismoking groups' efforts at the federal, state and local levels to ban smoking in office buildings and other public places. .  According to the study, 87.9% of all nonsimkers in the U.S. have detectable levels of cotinine in their blood. Cotinine is . a nicotine residue chat turns up in the blood Serum of individuals exposed to tobacco smoke. The survey, conducted from 1988 to 1991, involved physical examinations of  12,678 Individuals nationwide, Nousmokers Understate Exposure  Of the noasmokers surveyed. 12.4% reported they were exposed fo tobacco smoke at work only, compared with 7.7% whe reported (hey were exposed to tobacco stnoke at home only; 38.8% reported no exposure at ali, and 3.1% reported expe Sure at both home and work.  The JAMA study offers strong evidence fhat people tend to understale their expo sure to passive smoke. There is a wide gap between nonsmokers who say they are  ‘exposed to tobacco smoke — 37% of adults and 43% of children — compared with the 37.9% whose cotinine shows they are ax- posed. This gap is significant because most previous studies of workplace paasive- stoke exposure, many af them funded by the tabacco industry, relied on survey data rather than blood samples. :  Even though the stody found that mora noUSMmOKers are exposed to tobacco smoke at work than at home, the study makes Clear that the amount of nlentine absorbed inte @ nonsmoxer’s bloodstreatt is likelier to ba higher iF one lives with 2 smoker than if one works with one. Nonstokers ex- Posed to tobacco at home had roughly twice as Much cotinine in their blood as nen-                      smokers exposed (o tobacco at work.  The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration has proposed a rep- ulation that would ban virtually all smok- ing in the workplace. Bui the agency has moved slowly in issuing a final rule ~ it isn't expected this year — partly because agency officials are combing through a mountain of public comments and partly because of budget euts. The new findings were made avaliable to OSHA before its comment period on the smoking rule ended in mid-January. ‘  The Environmental Protection Agency declared passive smoke a carcinogen nearly four years ago, but thelr finding has stirred some controversy in the scientific community, A racent report by the Con- gressional Research Service expressed such uncertainty on the opie that advo- cates far and against tobacea both claimed vindication from it.  But James Firkle, the study's lead author, yesterday said the new findings are “much better data than the CRS report ever looked at." ‘  But Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman forthe Tobacco Institute, said of the JAMA findings, “It's net a health-effects study.” She said the study focused on nicotine exposure as measured in “molecules, and that the source of these wace amounts might be certain foods, such as tomatoes or potatoes, or a “momentary whiff" of to- bacco smoke.

INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia To: Distribution Date: Dec. 6, 1994 From: Peter Martin Subject: Minutes of Meeting on NO Concentration Modification and Document Availability     On 17 November a meeting was held to develop ideas on modifying the concentration of NO in mainstream smoke. The following issues were discussed:-  1. Nitrate in tobacco as the principal source of NO in smoke. 2. General methods identified in existing patents and literature.  3. The impact of cigarette dilution on smoke component concentrations.  4, Existing patents 5. Results of a Central File search on this topic.  It was felt that discussions should be resumed once there has been an opportunity to review the  existing patents and literature. To this purpose the result of a recent search is attached to this memo. The complete set of documents, patents, internal memos and reports, and some external articles has been assembled and is available in Central File, see either Michele Thomas or Mary Satterfield and refer to the "NO" File. This set can be borrowed for review, but no internal  document should not be copied. If you require a personal copy of any of these documents please request it through Central File or the Patent Group.

Grizzel REG  SUBJECT: TLA MONTHLY SUMMARY - MAY, 1990  The following is an outline of our activities during May, 1990.  I. Samples submitted for analysis TLA - 57 samples were processed through the Primary. Routine Chemical International - 75 samples Oriental Leaf - -47 samples Export Blend - 40 samples Off-Shore - - 2 samples Stemmery - 1 sample Speculative - 1 sample  166 total samples II. Results Reported Results on 163 routine chemical analysis samples were reported. LILI. Instrumentation/Equipment Our x-ray machine malfunctioned on May 10, 1990. We were unable to perform energy calibration. After talking with Tracor personnel on the phone, they shipped us a power supply board and an options board. Our maintenance personnel replaced the power supply board and a Tracor service representative stepped us through the process of adjusting the pots on the options board. We were then able to. adjust the gain and zero to bring the instrument back on line. The cutter drum was removed on May 24, 1990 and taken to Jewett Machine. They placed the drum on their coordinate measuring machine and will provide us with a scaled drawing of it. Hopefully this drawing will give us some insight into why we have had so much difficulty obtaining the desired cuts per inch, 00447176  i ~t  ELSTESOSOZ __label__Memo

Surge PhD Associate Research Scientist University of Michigan Medical School  What are the biological air soljutante that pose risks to public health?  Biological air pollutants or “bicaerosols" are particles or vapors in the air that are derived from living organiams. Microscopic organisms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi (mold) become airborne, as well as toxic and allergenic compounds produced by their growth in the environment. In addition, higher organiama such as cockroaches, dust mites, cats, dogs, birds, etc. shed allergens into the air. are common  Ww e i i 2  Biological air pollutants cause infections, allergies, and toxic diseases. Some of these are listed below:  Organism Source th seace  Virus Humans : Influenza : Measles Chicken pox Some colds Bacteria Humans Tuberculosis Water reservoirs Legionnaires’ disease Water reservoirs Humidifier fever Heating systems "Farmera’ lung disease”  (hypersensitivity pneumonia) odors, discomfort  Fungi Damp materials Aspergillosis (infection) “Farmers’ lung: disease” Asthma  “hay fever*  Acute toxic disease Cancer  edors, discomfort  Sick building syndrome?  The infectious diseases result when a living microorganism invades and grows in human tissue. The airborne viral diseases (all of which are infectious) are transmitted through the air from one person to another. Most of the airborne viral diseases affect anyone who has not already had the disease, including normal healthy children and adultes. They are familiar and need not be reviewed here. Tuberculosis is a familiar lung disease that, as with viruses, ia tranemitted through the air when infected patients cough, sing, or even talk. The organisms does not grow in environmental reservoirs such as cooling towers or humidifiers. Normal healthy people require large doses of the causative bacterium before infection occurs. Tuberculosis is a re-emerging problem because there are increasing numbers of patienta with impaired immunity (including AIDS patients) who are highly susceptible to the disease.

TO:  June 8, 1995  Mr. E. J. Fackelman  FROM: Ms. P. S, Cohen  SUBJECT: SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES  Penny S, Cohen BUSINESS INFORMATION & ANALYSIS  PSC:dh  MARLIN APRIL TOPLINE REPORT  The MARLIN Topline Report covering the April period was issued on May 30.  Performance Overview:  Industry Full Price/Savings mix held about flat in April. Retail performance of most companies was also stable month-to-month.  RJR’s Full Price performance was in line with expectations. We experienced continued slight SOM and SOFP softness related to increased retail presence on Marlboro, continued high  levels of competitive Branded Savings discounting, and less aggressive discounting activity than anticipated on our own key FP brands.  RJR’s Savings business stayed on trend from March to April, with slight growth on DORAL partially offsetting continued softness on MONARCH and BEST VALUE.  Outlook:  We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we'll continue to be impacted by the same competitive factors that contributed in April.  Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases.  Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to show little, if any, impact from the PM product recall.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke in Aircraft Cabins: A Scientific Perspective  The U.S. Department of Transportation’s position on the issue of smoking in aircraft cabins is based on scientific principles. In responding to recommendations offered by the National Academy of Sciences in their report on the Airliner Cabin Environment, the Department recognized that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers [emphasis added]. They concluded, however, “that further study is needed before the Department can propose a definitive response to [the Academy's} recommendation". The call for further study reflects the simple fact that not enough is known about the concentrations of ETS in cabins and therefore non-smokers’ exposure to ETS. Attitudes bearing on the issue are currently more subjective than objective.  The scientific literature contains but a few reports providing information regarding measurements of ETS in cabins. All these reports share a common feature: . data indicate ETS concentrations to be very low.  In a report to be published in October, 1987 in the American Chemical Society’s periodical, Environmental Science & Technology, Oldaker and Conrad find ETS exposures in no-smoking sections to average 4 thousandths of a "cigarette equivalent"* for an approximate one-hour flight. Additionally, these researchers find that segregation effectively reduces non-smokers’  exposure to ETS. Comparable exposures were reported by Japanese researchers in . .  Historically, findings of low ETS concentrations extend back to the first such reported study which was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health Education and Welfare and Transportation. One notable aspect of this study is that it was conducted before segregation was required. The other is that the segregation requirement ultimately derived not from the results of  the measurements but from responses to questionnaires on passengers’ attitudes  toward smoking.  Experiments have also been performed involving measurements of flight attendants’ bodily fluids in order to estimate exposure to ETS. These experiments can be summarized with the conclusions drawn in the New England Journal of Medicine by one research group representing the San Francisco  General Hospital Medical Center:  the quantity of [nicotine, an indicator of ETS] consumed {equivalent to one cigarette} is relatively small compared with that consumed by cigarette smokers, and the concentrations achieved are unlikely to have physiologic effects.  .*The "smoke equivalent of a cigarette” is calculated from measurements of nicotine and particles, major components of environmental tobacco smoke. Calculation assumes a person breathing at a certain rate and a cigarette delivering a sales-weighted average amount of nicotine and/or tar as reported by the FTC. The cigarette equivalent is an estimate of. exposure and should not be confused with dose (that {s, how much smoke a person breathes and  -l-  9229 62905 __label__Report
INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  TO: Doug Young FROM: Jennifer Bailey  RE: Web Gathered Cigarette Technology DATE: August 12, 1992  As I mentioned to you earlier, I am very interested in the web gathered cigarette technology as a means to improve cigarette quality. ayeas of interest include the following:  Improved cigarette rod uniformity  Enhanced consistency .  Elimination of loose ends  Elimination of stem holes  Incorporation of additives such as calcium carbonate to control burn rate & ash formation  Flavor addition  eoo0o0o00  °  However, I realize this technology is in its exploratory stages of development and requires additional testing and refinements before we can consider it as a replacement for cut filler.  As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/ cigarette~-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette technology sooner than originally projected.  In essence, this approach could provide incremental improveménts to our current products while minimizing the risks associated with a wholesale change.  I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.  diy  Jennifer Bailey __label__Letter
