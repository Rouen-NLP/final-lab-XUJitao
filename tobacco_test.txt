PROJECT DESCRIPTION TITLE: Role of the erbB3 protein in growth factor-coupled signaling  BACKGROUND  It is well accepted that cancer is the outcome of a loss of regulation at one or more points of a growth factor-coupled signal transduction pathway. This has generated a great deal of interest in understandin the sequence of events that leads to a mitogenic response. In this "Background section", I first wi present a brief overview of the superfamily of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in human cancers, and in particular, in lung cancers. This will be followed by a general description of our proposed studies (based on hypotheses that are put forward from our ongoing research) and the specific aims of the proposal.  Subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases-The subclass 1 growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (1) include the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase (also designated HER2), the erbB3 protein (HER3), and the erbB raiein (HER4). Each of these proteins appear to be comprised of a single olypeptide chain (My; ~ 170-180 kDa) that includes a cysteme-rich extracellular (growth factor bin ind domain, a single membrane-spanning helix, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain that contains a number of potential autophosphorylation sites. The first important step in the signaling pathways of these receptors is the translation of the growth factor binding event into the activation of tyrosine kinase activity. An immediate outcome of this activation event is the autophosphorylation of the receptor which in turn serves to recruit cellular Bhosphosubstrates and initiate signaling cascades that lead to the nucleus. It has now been well established that proteins that contain the src-homology region 2 (SH-2 domains) bind to the autophosphorylated growth factor receptors. An important challenge is to understand how these binding events initiate the various signaling pathways that emanate from a given receptor, as well as to identify other proteins that participate in these signaling pathways and determine how these pathways are integrated to give a biological (growth) response.  Relevance of subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases to lung cancer-  A number of lines of evidence have implicated subclass 1 receptors in different types of cancer. For example, the amplification of the neu/erbB2 tyrosine kinase has been found in 15-40% of primary breast carcinomas and 30% of ovarian carcinomas and appears to have a significant predictive value for the overall survival of patients with breast cancer (2). In various lung cancers, both the EGF receptor and nev/erbB2 have been found to be overexpressed (3,4). The presence of the EGF receptor to a significantly  eater extent in non-small-cell lung cancer and squamous carcinomas compared to non-squamous tumors 3) has been demonstrated. The levels of EGF receptor were related to the stage of spread of the lung tumors. In fact, the demonstration of a high concentration of EGF receptor in the worst prognosis non- small-cell lung cancer led to the suggestion that this receptor, or components of its signaling pathway, might serve as a potential target for therapy (3). It also has been suggested that the expression of the nev/erbB2 tyrosine kinase in lung cancers is of potential prognostic importance (4). Expression of neu/erbB2 occurs in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung and at higher levels than in uninvolved bronchiolar epithelium; moreover, in adenocarcinomas, the expression of neu/erbB2 is independently associated with a shortened survival.  Mechanisms of receptor activation and aberrant signaling-  Obviously a key question concerns how the overexpression (or amplification) of these receptor tyrosine kinases leads to uncontrolled cell growth. The detection of normal basal mucosal staining in the lung for EGF receptor (3) led to the suggestion that these stem cells of the mucosa may require EGF for proliferation and differentiation to normal mucosal cells. If EGF receptor activity, and/or neu/erbB2 activity, were necessary for the normal growth of lung cells, then events that result in the overexpression of these receptors could elicit an overamplification of a growth signaling pathway and thereby initiate tumorigenesis. It is tempting to speculate that this may occur because increased levels of the EGF receptor or neu/erbB2 would stimulate (in a growth factor independent manner) receptor-receptor interactions. A number of lines of evidence now indicate that the ability of subgroup 1 receptor tyrosine kinases to dimerize (i.e. form homodimers or heterodimers) provides for the initiation of diverse signaling pathways. For example, the formation of an EGF receptor-neu/erbB2 heterodimer results in an EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the neu/erbB2 protein and enables the EGF receptor and neu/erbB2 to act synergistically to transform mouse fibroblasts (5).  e have obtained evidence for another type of heterodimer formation, specifically between neu/erbB2 and the erbB3 protein (6). These studies were initiated because of the findings that the putative ligand (growth factor) for neu/erbB2, designated heregulin (also called neu differentiation factor) (7), could bind to neu/erbB2 in some cells (cg. mammary carcinomas) but not all cells (fibroblasts). Given the tendency of the members of the subclass 1 receptors to form heterodimers, it seemed possible that  50665809 __label__Scientific
THe Counciz For ToBpacco Resrarcu-U.S.A., Inc. 110 EAST 50TH STREET , NEW YORK, N. ¥. 10022  August 16, 1971  Dr. D. M. Conning Senior Pathologist Industrial Hygiene Research Laboratories  Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd.  Alderly Park  Macclesfield, Cheshire , ‘ England ,  Dear Doctor Conning:  The Council for Tobacco Research, as you are undoubtedly aware, has been engaged for many years in studies to determine the biological consequences of cigarette smoke inhalation by various small animals, both under acute and especially under chronic conditions. The best-known studies from the program are those that have been published by Drs. Cecile and Rudolph Leuchtenberger, now of Lausanne, Switzerland, who have been receipients of Council grants-in-aid since 1957. There are, however a number of others  more recently inaugurated.-  In 1965, we held a conference to review the devices and methodology  for such investigations, with a view to improving them and so standardizing  them as to increase the comparability of results obtained in different laboratories. An account of this conference, the considerations that led to its organization and of the conclusions reached, was contained in our Annual  Report for 1965-66. Certain pages from this report are attached hereto.  The criteria to be met by a satisfactory mechanical device and the methods of using it have been further defined and refined subsequently during the course of a program to compare critically the best devices that were available at that time or that became available subsequently. An updated  statement of these criteria as we see them now is attached.  The study of these machines and of a new positive-pressure device that was designed anew after the 1965 conference has led to development of a relatively simple machine that meets most of the criteria that were set up originally or added subsequently. A statement of its present status is attached.  Dr. Arthur Furst, Director of the Institute of Chemical Biology at the University of San Prancisco in California, has long been engaged in inhala- tion research and has served The Council as a consultant in this field since the 1965 conference mentioned. He subsequently spent a sabbatical year with us full-time as a consultant in this and other matters and, since returning to San Francisco is again actively engaged in inhalation research under a Council  contract.  ‘CTR CONTRACTS 000691  Ae ERE OT EE TRUER oan Mitt Fm WARE ge . : “ 7 oe 1 en a __label__Letter

FIELD MARKETXNG MANAGER MEDIA GUIDELINES  When contacted by a reporter, field marketing managers should forward calls to the public relations staff. You  should also contact your RJR Marketing contact.  If reporter insists that he/she needs to talk with a local RJR representative, field marketing manager should respond  that his/her responsibility is field marketing support, not media relations. PR staff in Winston-Salem will support  field marketing managers by emphasizing to reporter that managers are not prepared to represent the company's view on all issues.  If approached by a television crew, field marketing manager should stop all sampling procedures. Do not cause an uproar -- simply cease all sampling activities quietly.  All other events should continue as scheduled, with age verification particularly stringent.  Be aware that some news crews or photographers will "plant" underage children near the activity, appearing as if they are waiting to participate. The field marketing manager is responsible for politely moving along such clearly underage people.  It is preferable for announcements of RJR donations, sponsorships, etc., to be made by the recipient organization on their letterhead. However, before an organization sends out a news release on an RJR contribution, sponsorship or other involvement, the field marketing manager must send that release to Public Relations for approval before it is released. The same applies to any photos/captions being provided to the media.  CC6QS  T6o0e __label__Report

The Board also acts as a go between for new customers and brokers. We feel this is important to help  new customers, to show that we appreciate their interest in our crop, and to help them get started on the right foot.  With new markets opening up throughout the world for American-type — cigarettes, this offers a great opportunity for Maryland American-type cigarettes are considered the best in the world. In some countries they are also considered a status symbol. The Board feels that these countries that are hungry for American-type cigarettes offer the greatest opportunity for Maryland tobacco.  The countries of the Asian Pacific Rim and Eastern Europe seem to be the most promising at this time. The Pacific Rim countries probably offer the greatest promise because of better economic conditions and availability of hard currency.  A trip by four Board members to the sixth World Tobacco Expo in Vienna, Austria had positive results. Three countries, Hungary, Egypt, and Indonesia have asked for samples. These requests have been forwarded to the licensed tobacco brokers. The trip also helped put Maryland tobacco out front for the world to see, We hope this leads to requests by more countries for samples. We also were pleased to learn that Austria Tabak, the Austrian national tobacco monopoly has started using Maryland tobacco again. Dr. Karl Just, head of raw leaf for Austria Tabak, said Maryland tobacco was very competitive in the world markets right now.  One other factor in Maryland's favor at this time is a worldwide shortage of air »  cured tobacco. This isn’t to say there is no t.ced to promote Maryland tobacco. Now is the time to push our product and tell potential customers why they should use Maryland. While air cured tobacco is short now, if prices rise, nobody knows how  many growers may try to raise air cured types of tobacco in the future. We owe it to  ourselves to continue to promote our product so we can remain competitive in the market place.     ZBTIL O6OTS __label__Report

The Associated Press     Mario Andretti won his 66th career pole Saturday at Michigan international Speedway.  Andretti burns up track  BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) --- Mario Andretti stole the show Saturday in time trials for Sun- day’s Marlboro 500, turning the fastest qualify- ing lap'in motorsports history.  The 53-year-old Andretti took the pole posi- tion for the 500-mile race with a blazing lap of 234,275 mph on a virtually perfect day at Michigan International Speedway.  Andretti’s effort knocked Newman-Haas Racing teammate Nigel Mansell’s 233.462 out of the top spot and was considerably quicker than the 232.618 lap by Roberto Guerrero in 1992 at Indianapuus that had stood as the fastest official qualifying lap until Saturday.  The record-smashing lap on the bumpy 2- mile, high-banked oval was not quite as quick as the hand-timed unofficial Indy-car closed- course record of 234.5 set by Jeff Andretti, the younger of Mario’s two racing sons, during a test session Feb. 23 at Texas World Speedway.  “TY was a little worried about how things were dragging today,” Andretti said. “Things        weren't going off on time and I was afraid the track conditions would deteriorate if we wait- ed too much longer. But it seemed like ev- eryone was running a little faster than this morning (in practice), so I just held my breath and went for it.  “The track was great,” he added, “The only thing that would have made it better is if it had been overcast.”  Mansell already had qualified on the warm, calm and sunny afternoon, breaking Andretti's track qualifying mark of 230.150, set last year. So Andretti, who upped his Indy-car record to 66 career poles, knew he had his work cut out for him.  “I attacked the track from the word go,” the four-time series champion said. “We needed to build momentum and reach the speed.”     9SE062E80z __label__News
ate PHILIP MORRIS, U. S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  0 “Ut Ong To: S. Darrah Date: January 2H Key, 4S From: A. Dixon “Ap  Subject: CAPITAL APPROPRIATION REQUEST ~- WEL CLEAN-UP SYSTEM - PARK 500  Attached is an Appropriation Request for $172,000 capital and $3,000 retirement expense to upgrade the weak extracted liquor (WEL) system on Line III at Park 500. This proposal will improve the facilities yield by reducing the amount of rich brown water (RBW) discharged to Waste Water Treatment.  In the RL process, foreign material is removed from incoming tobacco through a tramp material eliminator and high density Cleaners. These devices utilize fresh water as the separation and cleaning medium. By converting the separation medium from water to WEL, additional RBW can be utilized.  Weak extracted liquor is the RL process filtrate from the second pressing operation. It is re-input for dilution in the Line III blending wet slurry and the stock preparation steps. If more of the WEL stream is used in the blend preparation, an additional amount of the RBW stream can be used as process dilution in stock preparation. RBW is the filtrate from the Machine Room, the excess of which is discharged to Waste Treatment.  The WEL recycle stream will have to be upgraded to use it as a separation fluid; tobacco fibers must be removed and the stream heated. Heating the WEL will ensure control of microbiological activity. Implementation of this proposal will accomplish both requirements and hence allow 387,696 pounds of tobacco to be saved annually (Attachment 1). This project has an ROI of 19.2% and a payback period of 4.9 years by avoiding scrap tobacco purchases.  This project was included in the 1990 Third Revised Capital  Forecast for $250,000 and was not included in the 1990-1994 Five Year Plan.  /dw ‘ d99.doc  2050062998 __label__Memo

KRAUSE, M.D.  Robert C, Hockett, Ph.D.  Associate Scientific Director  The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A. 110 East 59th Street  New York, N.Y. 10022  Dear Dr. Hockett:  Thank you very much for the privilege of reading this manuscript. I return it to you herewith and also enclose a copy of a recent article that has some interesting and apparently contradictery findings, namely that the VST returns to normal within a short time after experimental ligation of a coronary artery.  I am still very much disturbed with the clinical implication of this manuscript. As I wrote previously, the audience and the reader is con- ditioned to accept the results without recognizing that the experiments possibly lack clinical relevance. Thus.  (1) The authors point out that the Framingham study found that sudden death from coronary artery disease was four times as high in the heavy smoker as is the non-smoker. The authors also pdint out that the” wost likely cause for sudden death is ventricular fibrillation.  What the authors fail to state is that neither the Framingham group nor any other group found that sudden death from coronary artery disease occurs predominantly while smoking or sooner after smoking. If this were so, there would be little difficulty in proving cause and effect. On the contrary, the temporal relation between smoking and sudden death has never been documented. Indeed a1} evidence, at least within the hospital and within the Coronary Care Unit, indi- cates that ventricular fibrillation with or without sudden death occurs without immediate antecedent smoking. The experimental temporal relation therefore has no counter part in clinical medicine. I do believe that these points should be discussed and stressed in this article. . __label__Letter

The following Conference Report serves only as a top line of the findings.  The 3 sessions on March 11 were comprised of male Marlboro smokers age 18-34. The 3 sessions on March 12 consisted of 1 group of Marlboro smokers, 2 groups of CAMEL smokers. All attendees had attended at least 1 sporting event in the last 18 months. Each group was exposed to 4 CAMEL Brand executions, 4 existing Sports Marketing ads, 9 comps for proposed Sports Marketing advertising, a sports themed Smooth Magazine and 4 CAMEL sports characters. Although the opinions and overall mindset of the groups were diverse, several creative guidelines were established for CAMEL Sports Marketing executions:  * Realism is a key ingredient in all concepts accepted by the groups - the vehicles and the placement of them in the arena must be believable and relevant. (bike flying out of the stadium) In addition, Joe must be in a position that is viewed as being conceivable (wouldn't be on hay bales and other unattainable locations).  Joe should be involved/interact and clearly exhibit interest in the sports depicted (not looking at the action on hay bale execution and the GT sky box comps).  Joe must be relatable, accessible and one of us - yet be "special."

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.  TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017  Herb Foster May 27, 1987  Nancy Gurry Virginia Slims Ultra Lights  This report updates Virginia Slims Ultra Lights most recent performance in the Memphis and San Francisco test markets. Several data sources will be referenced in order to provide a thorough analysis: Factory Shipments, ICC, Retail Audits, and SPACE. Factory shipments were jnitiated 1/22/87 with availability at retail effective 2/27/87.  Memphis  Shipment data reflect that Virginia Slims Ultra Lights registered a 0.6 S.0.M. based on recent four week period ending 5/15/87. Share was virtually evenly distributed with Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Regular displaying a 0.27 share and Virginia Slims Ultra Lights Menthol contributing 0.31 share points.  At the distributor level, the brand's 4 week rolling averages have continually grown, currently residing at a 0.8 level (w/e 4/24) -- equivalent to shipment data at that point in time.  Retail data, reflecting a 50 store panel located in the Memphis trading area, are positioned at the 1.5 level based on the recent four week period ending 4/26. The Ultra Light Regular and Menthol levels were basically equal exhibiting a respective 0.7 and 0.8 S.0.M. The Ultra Low Tar line extension currently attains a similar share in pack outlets (S.0.M: 1.6) compared to performance in carton outlets (S.0.M: 1.4) based on the current four week period. While the retail share data in this report appear to be overstated in the two test markets, these levels are at parity with share of smoker data reported by Consumer Research, derived from a survey during week 10 after introduction.  In the audit panel, Virginia Slims Ultra had a distribution level of 83% for the two week period ending 4/13 -- down -7 versus the prior two weeks. Of the 83% carrying, 5% reported being completely 00S of the brand. During the next two weeks, distribution increased to the 86%  level and none of the stores reported 00S.  SPACE continues to report an availability of 85% as of w/e 5/08/87 -- at parity with the audit panel.  VWseseoage  Als __label__Memo

A ITuman PB-PK Model for Simulating Nicotine Uptake from Transdermal Delivery and Cigarette Smoking  Speaker: Dr. J). Donald deBethizy Presentation Time: 45 minutes  Human exposure to nicotine can occur from tobacco use, ETS, diet, gum, nasal spray, or transdermal delivery. A human PBPK model for nicotine and a major nicotine metabolite, cotinine, was developed from a previously published rat PBPK model. A novel forearm compartment was used to describe the blood sampling site in humans.  The model accounted for 20% decrease in nicotine clearance during cigarette smoking. The human model predicts plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine following  intravenous injection, smoking, and transdermal delivery of nicotine. The model 7  suggests that tissue kinetics following transdermal delivery closely resemble those via steady-state intravenous infusion. The human forearm compartment overcomes some limitations when scaling a rat PBPK model to humans where the venous sampling sites are different.  This human PBPK model for nicotine will be useful for examining differences in the time course of pharmacodynamic responses to nicotine following the indicated routes of administration. __label__Report

Cytokine Expression in the CNS: Correlation with the Expression of Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors  Introduction  Senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer’s disease, AD) is characterized by gliosis and deposits of R-amyloid protein in various regions of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Changes in the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) have been observed in the early stages of AD and smoking can delay the onset of this disease suggesting that smoking may alter the expression of nAChR. Are there other factors that may contribute to the observed changes in nAChR expression associated with AD? One molecule that may play a regulatory role in the CNS is !L-1. The cytokine IL-1 induces inflammation and immunity in the peripheral immune system, but in the CNS IL-1 induces astrogliosis, cholinergic neuron sprouting, and the production of amyloid proteins. Further, brain IL-1 is elevated in AD. The purpose of this application is to determine whether changes in cytokine  expression occur in conjunction with and perhaps resulting from, changes in nAChR expression.  Ongoing studies in my laboratory suggest an overlap in the expression of members of the IL-1 family (IL-1, IL-18, and IL-1ra) and members of the nAChr family in the CNS as measured by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. | have also observed that the expression of some members of each family are co-regulated in PC12 cells subsequent to differentiation into neuronal-like cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) or into chromaffin-like cells by dexamethasone. These findings are consistent with the notion that there exists a regulatory interplay between IL-1, NGF, and nAChRs in the CNS.  The experiments to be proposed will investigate the possibility that the expression of a cytokine in the CNS both enhances the action of trophic factors that alter the expression of nAChRs and whose expression in turn is modified by the production of nAChRs.  Background  An extended family of related cDNAs that encode functional neuronal nAChRs has been identified. The mammalian neuronal nAChR family consists of at least six a-like subunits (designated a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, and a7) and three Q-like subunits (designated R2, 3, and R4). /n situ hybridization has demonstrated that RNA for each of these subunits is expressed in unique, but overlapping, regions of the rat brain. The significance of this result is further supported by studies where the pair-wise injection of in witro synthesized RNA encoding an alpha and a beta subunit into Xenopus oocytes has shown that the pharmacology and single channel properties of the resulting receptors varies with changes in subunit composition. Although the subunit composition of a native rnammalian nAChR remains to be determined, the high affinity *H-nicotine binding sites have been shown to be composed predominantly of a4+82 subunits and the '”5!-a-bungarotoxin site corresponds with the expression of the a7 subunit. As will be detailed below, | propose to combine the use of in situ hybridization and  immunchistochemistry to address the question of co-expression and regulation of nAChRs and IL-1.  Similar to the nAChRs, the IL-1 family consists of distinct molecules that are related by similarity in size and structure. Of the three known IL-1 molecules, two, IL-1a@ and IL-18, bind to the iL-1 receptor (IL-1R) to induce a pro-inflammatory response. The third member of this family, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) competes with IL-1a@ and IL-1 for binding of the receptor but fails to activate the receptor signalling pathway upon binding. Hence IL-1ra is __label__Scientific
Pentagon Steps Up Effort to Limi     Promotion, Sale of Tobacco in Miltary     By Bradley Graham  ‘Washington Post Staff Writer  Stepping up efforts to curb cigarette smoking among military personnel, the Pentagon intends to ban such premo tional practices as military-only discount coupons and tobacco company pay- ments ts stores for favorable product placement, and will limit the amount of shelf space reserved for tobacco prod- ucts in military outlets.  The Defense Department's antismoking drive reflects heightened concern, Pentagon officials say, about the drain on tighter military budgets of lost productivity and rising health care costs associated with smoking, But the Pentagon's inifiative has generated sparks over the past year with a House defense subcommittee, many of whose members have received campaign dona- tions from the tobacco industry.  A decision last suramer to raise the price of cigarettes sold in military com- missaries led to heated congressional charges that the Pentagon had failed to consult sufficiently with legislators and was Violating federal pricing rules that  required commissaries to sell products at it “the lowest practical price.” One tobacco-state lawmaker, Rep. C. Saxby Chambliss (R4Ga.), warned the Penta- gon earlier this year not to impose the restrictions on cigarette advertising and marketing that defense officials have now formally notified Congress they plan to put into effect this summer.  Although the latest measures afe not expected to draw enough congressional opposition to block them, the smoking issue generally has placed the Pentagon in the trying position of balancing con- cems about the health and fitness of service members against the rights of members to choose whether to smoke.  For years, military life facilitated smoking. Mess kits contained free ciga- rette packs, Tobacco firms would send cigarettes to combat zones as a patriotic gesture, a practice stopped during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Training drills allowed for periodic smoke breaks, Car- tons could be purchased in military commissaries for discounts of up to 76 percent off commercial retail prices.  “A lot of people picked up smoking in the military.” said John Mazzuchi, a Pentagon health official who has had a role in the antismoking effort's slow evolution. “We had to create a new  educational environment, a new culture in which the command was saying smoking is not cool, it's not good for you and it’s bad for overall readiness of the force.”  Defense Department attempts to cur- tail smoking began in the mid-1980s, although the campaign was limited then to educating service members about the health risks of using tobacco products. By the early 1990s, a government-wide effort to ban smoking in federal areas led to a smoke-free Pentagon and desig- nated smoking areas on military bases,  But raising commissary prices was a  much more sensitive proposition, be- cause the discounts available in these government-subsidized military super- markets are highly valued by service members. Defense officials were reluc- tant to single out any product as an exception. Besides, tobacco products were big business for commissaries, generating $747 million in revenue and $103 million in profits and surcharge revenue in 1995.  ‘What finally prompted the Pentagon to act were the rising costs of smoking- related productivity losses and medical care, estimated at $930 million in 1995.  “We were actually asking the Ameri- can taxpayer to subsidize a product that we knew was injurious to health, in which there were substantial costs,” said Fred Pang, the Pentagon’s assistant secretary for force management.  Cigarettes are still sold in the mili- tary’s 230 commissaries, but responsi bility for managing the sales now rests with the military exchanges, which are not subsidized and so charge more. Even so, tobacco prices in these military outlets remain below commercial retail levels—a fact that defense officials ap- pear resigned to accept rather than court more political attack.  “We considered raising prices to pre vailing market rates, and we concluded that at least for now, the pricing policy we have is defensible.” said Pang. “We have not rejected absolutely that we would not do something like raise prices farther. That is under review now.”  Areport by the Pentagon's inspector general. issued in December, urged that prices be lifted to commercial retail levels. “The Department of Defense is sending a mixed messag é to its benedi- cjary population,” it said. “DOD should not encourage tobacco sales through discounted prices when the DOD health  community {fs striving to reduce the effects of tobacco on the active-duty force and its beneficiary population.”  In a move that defense officials see as retaliation for the earlier price hike. a House National Security subcommittee inserted language in this year's defense authorization bill shifting responsibility for overseeing the military stores from Pang's force management office to the comptroller.  Rep. John M. McHugh (N.Y), chairman of the House National Securi- ty Committee’s panel on morale, welfare and recreation (MWR), said in an inter- view that the measure had nothing to do with getting even. “It simply was an attempt to respond better to MWR programs, whose major crises are all financially related." the congressman stressed.  But the Pentagon is convinced re- venge played a part in the panel's attempt to eliminate the job held by Stephen Rossetti Jr., a former Demo- cratic staff member on the House sub- committee who was hired by Pang to revamp the military stores and imple ment the new cigarette policy.  “The panel's action clearly was at least somewhat retaliatory,” said Pang. “The comptroller could certainly do the job, but the military stores are regarded by service members as a benefit. a very valued benefit, and all the benefit pro- grams fall under this office. The pro- posed change would be an added re sponsibility for the comptroller that doesn't make any sense.”  Ina letter to McHugh last week, Pang  enclosed a draft copy of the new order” limiting promotional displays and shelf. space for tobacco products in military. stores. Additional measures banning cigarette sales to anyone under age 18, free samples and vending machine oper: ations were being taken to conform to Food and Drug Administration rules, Pang wrote, .  The Pentagon's declining tolerance for smoking has resulted in a drop in the proportion of smokers in uniform, from 52 percent in 1985 to 32 percent, slightly 6 above the civilian proportion. By 2000, defense officials intend to cut the num- ber of active-duty personnel who smoke to 20 percent,  “We going to continue to push it, but we have to look for our opportunities,” said Mazzuchi. “Having been here 24 CN years, | know you don't win every battle. ~" Weil take our victories where we can get them,” __label__News

Draft Dear Tom:  The compilation put together by the staff is impressive, even to an old-timer like me with 80 many years’ involve- cancer research. Actually, the list is a short one. When one looks at the numerous studies and projects approved by the Scientific Advisory Board and funded by CTR, one finds considerable important data that might not otherwise have been made available to the scientific community.  Looking back to when I first became associated with CTR, it is becoming increasingly evident that there are many weaknesses in the epidemiological and other work some people rely on when they blame cigarette smoking as being the major cause of lung cancer and other ailments.  The deficiencies of the tobacco causation hypothesis and the need of much research are becoming clearer to in- creasing numbers of research scientists.  r know there are many investigators who look at the to- bacco hypothesis with an unbiased and impartial eye and find that it has been over-simplified and over-interpreted. The propaganda efforts of various groups and agencies have instilled fear in the minds of many people. This is to’ be deplored, the more so because it is not based on good, honest science  To insist that scientific conclusions be based firmly on critical and unbiased research is an essential element  ‘in the search for truth. I am convinced the truth will come  in time and only from research.  I_am proud of my years with CTR. I know the members of the SAB are proud and grateful for the opportunity to de- velop a program that is aimed only at providing informa- tion.  The industry can take pride in its support of CTR through the years. The program of the SAB is a worthy one and has contributed much to the advancement of scientific knowledge. Certainly, it is, in my opinion, the largest and most intensive such program in the world and, I feel, the most productive in terms of getting solid findings in the area in which we sre interested.  With kindest regards.  . Sincerely,  BZN 16420 __label__Letter

Brice/Don: we need to make some decisions quick. while sue has verbally committed, the  magazines will want to have hard insertion orders to absolutely guarantee positions such as centerspread, and so Sue can negotiate the best up-front position for our insert where centerspread doesn't apply. as soon as LHC can issue the orders, the better.  So we have to make some decisions and need approval as quickly as we can get it on the list and the number of insertions. (wow -- 80.5MM circulation -- that's 'mighty tasty!)

omy  (1 2 17  R.J.Reynolds Tobacco Company  INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102 (9191 777-5000 BD) jie RO TO: M. F. Borgerding FROM: J. R. Hayes RE: Phase I Chemistry: , DATE: 12-10-87  Target Compounds  Approach to the Smoke Chemistry of the NEW CIGARETTE:  A critical element in the determination of the potential biologi- cal activity of NEW CIGARETTE smoke is the smoke chemistry. Initial studies indicate that the NEW CIGARETTE smoke is simpler than smoke from other cigarettes, consistent with prediction based upon product design.  The determination of NEW CIGARETTE aerosol chemistry is founded upon biological relevance using risk assessment. This results in a three phase program. Phase I consisted of the quantitative determination of the levels of specific "target" compounds. Quantitation utilizes the best available methodology. Phase II consisted of a semi-qualitative and quantitative determination of NEW CIGARETTE smoke constituents that occur at or above a level of 0.5 micrograms per cigarette. The 0.5 microgram per cigarette level was based upon risk assessment. Phase III analysis repre- sents the determination of the classical "Federal Trade Commis-—  sion type" cigarette smoke parameters measuring "tar", nicotine and carbon monoxide.  Smoke analysis concentrates on the "Tox Model" prototypes. Analysis is at R. J. Reynolds with specific analysis being performed at contract laboratories qualified for that analysis. As with the biological studies the 1R4F reference cigarette is used for comparison.  ayre 9490S __label__Letter

INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM  SUBJECT: Weekly Highlights DATE: August 4, 1987 Flavor Technology TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: Brian Lawrence 6) RVD. Flavor Support for SALEM . ~~  Products, in the SALEM KS and SALEM Light 85 styles, were made by Brand R&D using cavity filters containing various levels of menthol laden polymer beads. At their request, menthol formulations of cut filler application were designed to simulate the same menthol deliveries as the above prototypes. Calculations for these topdressings were based on the analyses obtained from the menthol content in the tobacco and the polymer beads. An aging study will be conducted by Brand R&D on the comparison of these two menthol products: mentholated beads in filter versus mentholated cut filler. It was also recommended to Brand R&D that a comparison of the puff-by-puff smoke menthol profiles is essential information if a true delivery of menthol against  time basis is to be understood.       7  Brian Lawrence     /mpm Xc: Applied R&D Managers  SET’ 9P90S __label__Letter

RJR CONFIDENTIAL       DISCRIMINATION [4        OTHER, LC]       SENSORY EVALUATION DIVISION ‘ L DESCRIPTIVE []  916 TEST REPORT NO. 7 ~ piacnostic § = []                       PROJECT: Flavored Triacetin Plasticizer Study - WINSTON Light 100 Box  TEST: Non-Menthol Discrimination               YEAR OF REPORT: 1987 NO. OF PAGES: 5.                  OBJECTIVE:        To determine if there is a perceptual difference between the current WINSTON Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype which has tow item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.               SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:           box material which had a high level of residual acetone. This product gave an “off" odor upon opening of the box. The Flavor Division recommends the addition of flavors to the WINSTON Light 100 Box tow item in order to mask high levels of residual acetone, should they occur in the product in the future.                      Discrimination results showed there was no perceptual difference between the current WINSTON Light 100 Box product and a WINSTON Light 100 Box prototype which has tow item made with additional flavorants added to the triacetin.            These results show that the addition of the flavorants will not change the perception of the WINSTON Light 100 Box product, but does not indicate whether or not the additional flavorants would mask any “off" odors caused by high levels of residual acetones.                 STATUS:           Sensory testing of the products was completed on September 14, 1987.          Brands Development and the Flavor Division are investigating the possibility of creating products with high level of residual ecetone, in order to "create the problem" again. Half of the prototypes made with high levels of residual acetone will have no flavorants added to the triacetin and the other half will have the flavorants added. These two prototypes will then be submitted for discrimination testing. The hypothesis being that if the added flavorants mask the "off" odor the products should be perceptually different. This test would then be followed up with descriptive testing in order to describe and quantify these differences.

RJR INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  June 11, 1984  To: Mr. G. H. Long From: Bob Di Marco  Subject: Technology Driven New Products Reporting Structure     Jerry:  Currently, the reporting structure for Project TSB consists of multiple committees and task forces. At the bottom level is a working team composed of representatives from various departments who are charged with the responsibility of coordinating day-to- day details of the project. This group reports to the TSB Task Force currently chaired by Bob Lloyd. The Task Force, in turn, reports to a Steering Committee composed of Hudnall Christopher, Harry Lees, Dale Sisel, and me. This Steering Committee was originally charged with coordination of domestic and internation- al efforts on TSB/TCF. Recently, a Worldwide Coordination Com- mittee has been formed to coordinate RJRT, RJRTI, and McCann- Erickson efforts to introduce a brand based on TSB technology. The current TSB structure is outlined on the first attachment.  A second project, TGA, is now beginning to develop a similar Structure. While coordination across departments is necessary, too much of its exists on TSB, and a similar phenomenon may be expected with TGA. Attachment 2 outlines a plan to’ replace the TSB structure and incorporate a reporting system for TGA and other technologically driven new product projects as well.  Features of this plan are as follows:  o The current TSB Steering Committee and TSB Task Force will be eliminated. RJRT Executive Officers will continue to receive reports on TSB and other new product projects.  o RJRT/RJRTI/McCann~Erickson efforts on TSB will continue to be coordinated through the Worldwide Coordination Committee.  o A New Products!' Steering Committee will be formed to deal with both TSB and TGA. Permanent members of this Committee will include RJRT representatives of R&D, New Brands Marketing, Marketing Development, Process Technology and Development, and Law.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.  C89-09067  INTER-OFPFPICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Mr. James Myracle Date: August 17, 1989 From: G. N. Yatrakis  Subject: Flavor Development Weekly Summary - Week of August 14, 1989  PROJECT ART:  A low pressure trial was run at the Bermuda Hundred Factory. Four (4) loops of filler were extracted at 2400 psi, 140 °F and 150 M/M. Extraction efficiency met the 97% target. Cigarettes will be requested in the low/ultra~low, KS/100mm and regular and menthol versions.  Bermuda Hundred Modules IIA and IIB achieved targeted extraction efficiency. Models were made and subjectively evaluated from both. Subjective approval was given for both Module IIA and IIB for production of BERM, CIG 8 and CIG &M filler.  A large-scale casing trial using 8$C-392 pilot plant filler has been completed in Semi-works with a new casing formulation (8611-78-1). Cigarettes have been requested with aftercut (8mg) for comparisons to the current casing, and without aftercut (8, 11, and 15mg) for further laboratory evaluations of new aftercut systems.  All of the filter modification models have been made and are in analytical for physical testing. Subjective evaluation of the models has been initiated. Evaluations continued with alkaline treatment of filler and filters in an effort to increase overall response of ART cigarette smoke.  The large-scale portion of the nicotine add-back study is complete. The nicotine add-back for small-scale has been rescheduled for early September.  Subjective screening has been completed of 24% RL’s (Marlboro configuration) from Park 500 with 2% and 4% Bermuda stem. The 4% level again was clearly different. Evaluation of combinations of these RL’s with test RCB’s (11% and 16% Bermuda stem) at normal levels in Marlboro are in progress to select models for POL tests. Pilot ES tests are in progress on both MPC and citric acid post-ART stem based on encouraging subjective results with NH,OH and Ca (OH), treatments. Analytical and subjective tests are in progress to establish specifications for Louisville ZS production trials.  AMBROSTA:  Subjective and analytical data indicate that Aromatek 215 (Vanillin Glucoside Acetal) and Aromatek 240 (Ethylvanillin Glucoside Acetal) are unstable in both methods of application, i.e., via side-seam adhesives or  ZOLESITSZ02 __label__Memo

PROJECT NUMBER: 1740 DATE: November 1, 1983  PROJECT TITLE: Flavor Components of Tobacco and Filler  PROJECT LEADER: C. S. Kroustalis  PERIOD COVERED: September 26 = October 25, 1983  I.  TOBACCO AND FILLER  A.  The following compounds were identified in the 8-glucosidase  hydrolyzate of the E-55 glucosidic fraction by Dr. F. Hsu  using GC/MS: 3-methyl-l-butanol, 2-methyl-2-buten-l-ol, 3—hexen-l-ol, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethylalcohol, 2-methy1-5-(2-methyl-5-isopropenyl tetrahydro-2-furyl) furan (tentative identification), 3-oxo-a-ionol, blumenol C, 4-(3-hydroxybutylidene)-3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexone (two isomers), cadineol, and hydroxysolavetivone (two isomers).  Propyl paraben determinations have been made on 45 RL samples and size. Size samples at timed intervals during a Pilot Plant run showed no concentration variation over several hours. RL sheet samples analyzed randomly indicated a small amount of application cycling in concentration levels. Standard response in the range of 100 to 2200 ng/yl was linear. Lower limit of detection under current analytical practices is 1.20 ng/ul. The RL sheet generated will be made into cigarettes to determine dust generation from RL as well as possible transfer of propyl paraben to non-RL blend  components.  We are currently working with Ms. E. T. Oakley in developing a procedure for estimating oriental tobacco in cigarettes. The methyl ester of 8-methylvaleric acid is used as the marker for oriental. Contributions from bright and burley tobaccos appear to be minimal (<10 ug/g versus 950 ug/g for oriental).  Preliminary results with synthetic Marlboro blends show good correlations, but B-methylvaleric acid concentration ranges in various grades of oriental from different countries need to be determined.  A procedure is being developed for determining C2-C,. volatile fatty acids in tobacco and filler. Although we were not successful with butyl ester derivatives because of dilution problems, benzyl ester derivatization shows promise. This procedure involves the reaction of the tetrabutylammonium salts of the acids with benzyl bromide in acetone.  ai S ar oo ~ “I an si Ne or __label__Scientific

CONTROL AND MIXIMIZATION OF TOBACCO SMOKE DOSE IN CHRONIC ANIMAL STUDIES  Why do we need inhalation studies with whole tobacco smoke, and what can we hope to accomplish with them? A stated purpose of the tobacco and health program is to develop a less hazardous cigarette (Reference 1). The major risks associated with tobacco smoke are cancer, notably respiratory tract cancer, chronic respiratory disease(s), and cardiovascular disease(s). While the toxicity and the harmful effects of individual tobacco smoke components can be assessed in bioassay systems not involving inhalation exposure, the full pathogenic potency of as complex a mixture as tobacco smoke ultimately must be determined by inhalation studies with whole smoke. This presentation focuses on some crucia] problems related to dosimetry and maximization of smoke exposure in tobacco smoke inhalation studies. We will limit our discussion to efforts aimed at the improvement and development of bioassays for testing the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of whole tobacco smoke in smal} laboratory rodents using passive smoke inhalation techniques.  Methods to Estimate Sustained Dose  Before discussing how to control and maximize the dose of tobacco smoke delivered to experimental animals, we need to take stock briefly of the major methods currently used to measure sus- tained dose and to suggest possible new approaches. It is important to remember that we will be measuring tobacco smoke components only, rather than whole tobacco smoke, but hopefully such measure- ments will be indicative of a class of compounds or a significant fraction of tobacco smoke. Currently, two main options are avail- able for measuring or estimating tobacco smoke dose, with perhaps a third one to be added in the future. The first is to measure normally occurring tobacco smoke constituents (or their derivatives) in the body or body fluids of exposed animals. The simplest and most common example of this approach is determination of COHb. The second principal approach, developed more recently, is to label tobacco with chemical or radioactive tracers, then determine the amount of tracer in the respiratory tract of, the exposed animals. This method is much more complicated than the former and requires that one have some knowledge of the fate of the tracer during pyrolysis, its distribution in the tobacco smoke, its volatility, etc. Typical examples of this approach are studies with decachloro- biphenyl] (2), '4c hexadecane (3), and 14c-dotriacontane (4,5). The advantage of this method is that one can measure dose to the lung directly (though it may be debatable what fraction of tobacco smoke the measured quantity represents). The disadvantage is that (at least with the markers currently in use) a destructive test is re- quired to determine the amount of tracer in the lungs. A third | possible alternative is to use depletion of smoke components from the exposure chamber as a measure of uptake or dose to the animals. (This approach, if feasible, probably will apply only to static  rather than dynamic exposure conditions.)  c 600 290s  neem >  a  -————  — __label__Report

Pointers For Parents     Edina Sentinel Edina, MO January 3, 2001      Start Talking To Stop Youth Smoking     (NAPSA)-Parents possess a pow- erful weapon to combat youth smoking-conversation-but many stay silent on the topic of tobacco, not knowing what to say or how to begin. Yet each day, thousands of children across the U.S. try their first cigarette, hoping to fit in. igok cool, rebel-or simply experiment.  Fortunately, parents now have a tool to help them begin a dialogue on not smoking-the “Take {10° instructional video featuring tips from Dr. Michael Popkin, founder and president of Active Parenting Publishers and the author of more than 20 parenting books and videos.  The video is part of the "Take 10” parent education initiative launched last year as part of the Lorillard Tobacco Company"s Youth  Smoking Prevention Program. In addition to the video, which is avail- able free to leaders of parent groups.  the program also includes the 2takelO.com Web site and a free brochure.  Any time is a good time  Most parents want family time together to be stress-free, and check- ing in with kids about important top- ics like not smoking isn't easy.  “Kids get uncomfortable easily- and may back away from any kind of formal discussion.” says Dr. Popkin. “Limit the first conversa- tion to about 10 minutes-to open the dialogue.”  When there is mutual trust, open cummunication between parents and children isn’t far behind. De. Popkin suggests three simple steps for     establishing expectations and build-. ing trust: “  . Listen to your child. Come from caring, not judgement.  . Teli your child how .you would feel if he or she tried smok- ing. Be careful not to lecture.  . Establish consequences, explain how disappointed you’ would feel or what you would do if he or she smoked.  Many parents don’t realize how strong of an impact they can make by spending a few minutes talking with their kids-especially about dif- ficult topics. .  Bringing “Take 10” home The free “Take 10” instructional video is available to parenting and  community groups by calling toll-  free 1-800-825-0060, or through www.activeparenting.com. Parents can receive the “Take 10” brochure by calling toll-free 1-877-2TAKE10 or visiting www.2takel0.com. . Lorillard Tobacco Company’s “TakelO” program is part of its national volunteer effort aimed at reducing youth smoking. It is designed to instruct parents on how to discuss not smoking with their kids. In addition, Lorillard sponsors a national advertising campaign and the Teen H.LP. Awards, a scholar- ship program aimed at reaching kids about not smoking, For more infor- mation about the initiatives, visit the program Web sites at www.buttout how.com or www.2takel0.com.  69265826 __label__News

Marlboro without TEG appears to spot worse than - Marlboro with TEG under 100°F/90RH. Results appear  similar with the Houston cycle. It appears that  Marlboro resistance to spotting may be dropping slightly. Meeting of domestic development personnel  . will be held on 2/27 to review spotting standards for domestic products.  3. Tobacco and blends ~- Flue cured, G7, G7A with and with- out addition of humectants has little or no effect on spotting.  Burley blends - slight effect - B3 increases spotting slightly, B9 also.  Casing burley definitely increases spotting - increases~- when B3 added - B3 and B9 increases spotting still more.  O@GcT cz@Tts __label__Letter

ROR Inter-office Memorandum  Subject: Status Report NL Project Date: February 25, 1976  To: Mr. D. P. Johnson From: a. J. Sensabaugh, Jr.  Project No.: 2394  Project Title: NL  Summary:  Regular and menthol NL~type cigarettes have been developed and submitted to Marketing for their evaluation. These cigarettes were designed to deliver 17 mg. "tar" and .15 mg. of nicotine. Various blends, top-dressings, and processing changes were evaluated to reduce the off taste and off aroma associated with the M-2000 process for nicotine removal. Although some reduction of the off taste and off aroma have been accomplished by removing the burley tobacco from the blend, changing from freon to pentane, modifying M~2000 processing conditions, and improved top-dressing, a definite off taste and off sidestream aroma in the smoke is still present. The off Flavor and undesirable sidestream aroma are apparently inherent to the M-2000 process,  Future work on this project will depend upon Marketing's recommendations after evaluating the products that have been submitted,  Memorandum:  Initial testing of various types and grades of tobacco showed that the M-2000 process did change the smoking characteristics of the tobaccos. The processing is more detrimental to burley tobacco than flue-cured tobacco in that the level of off taste and off aroma are greater. Evaluations of various grades of tobacco that were M-2000 processed showed the stronger grades reduced in strength and having smoking characteristics closer to the milder grades. All grades evaluated had a distinct M-2000 taste and aroma, All these observations were made using tobaccos processed in the freon system.  Initial evaluations of WINSTON-type NL cigarettes versus a WINSTON “Control” showed the WINSTON "Control" numerically favored in flavor  and preference with the NL significantly milder. These results are shown in Table I.  TABLE I ~ WINSTON "Control" versus WINSTON NL  L-7415-A L-7415-B  "Control" NL N.D.

Philip Morris Cos. {nc., which owns the Hpeaccanrompaty that makes best-selling  ‘ariboro and other cigarettes, publicly ac- knowledged with the debut of its corporate Internet site Wednesday that smokers face serious health risks.  The declarations by Philip Morris follow years in which it fiercely argued with gav- ernment and medical authorities about the risks of smoking.  President Clinton said Philip Morris’ ac- knowledgment that tobacco Isn't safe “comes far too iate but still we must all wel- come it, It can be the beginning of clearing the air.”  “Tt certainly makes clear, as I have said for years, that the lobacco companics should answer for their actions in court,” the president said Wednesday. "They  # See COMPANY/11A ® Continued from 1A  should stop marketing their prod- ucts to children.

March 26, 1973  Mr. R. H. Cundiff  Quarterly Report Tobacco Flavors Development Section  PROJECT NO. 2354 - CHEWING TOBACCO     Saccharin Replacement  Factory tests designed to evaluate replacements for saccharin have been completed and a report issued. Test results indicate that increasing licorice would be the most practical means of maintaining sweetness in chewing tobaccos, from both quality and cost standpoints, should saccharin be banned. FDA has not yet banned the use of saccharin in foods, but has reported finding bladder tumors in some of the animals used in their feeding studies.  Licorice from Chemicals and Phosphates, Ltd.  Tests designed to qualify a higher percentage of C&P licorice on Days Work , and to re-qualify it for other plug brands have been completed and a report issued. Test results indicated that products made with C&P licorice were equal to or better than controls. Manufacturing approved the recommendation that the Plug Division be allowed to use C&P licorice for up to two-thirds of the licorice requirements for each plug brand.  Rishmac Licorice  Tests designed to evaluate and qualify spray dried licorice produced in Iran by MacAndrews & Forbes on plug tobacco have been completed and a report issued. Test results indicated that this licorice would be suitable for up to fifty per- cent of the licorice requirements for chewing tobaccos. Usage of Rishmac licorice at this percentage was recommended in the report and Manufacturing accepted the recommendation.  PROJECT NO. 2356 - FIRMENICH/RJR BURLEY PROGRAM     Burley Flavor Modifiers  Preliminary evaluation of Burley Flavor Modifiers (Series 17, 18, and 19) submitted to RJR in October, 1972 was completed in January and a report submitted  to Firmenich, Two flavors (RJR 17C and 19B) were accepted for commercial evaluation  and Series 18 was rejected. The date for acceptance or rejection of 17C and/or .19B is January 16, 1974, Firmenich has accordingly provided us with a list of 27 compounds present in the Burley Tobacco Essential Oil which are in 17C and 19B. Our top dressing tests to date indicate that 17C is the best of these two flavors. An additional evaluation report was submitted to Firmenich in March.  866L thos __label__Letter

ON THE FORMATION OF 4~—(METHYLNITROSAMINO )—4—(3-PYRIDYL) BUTYRIC  ACID IN TOBACCO AND TOBACCO SMOKE  Mirjana V. Djordjevic, Claire W. Sigountos, Klaus D. Brunnemann,  and Dietrich Hoffmann  American Health Foundation Naylor Dana Institute for Disease Prevention  Valhalla, NY 10595 / U.S.A.  In order to determine the source of the: nicotine-derived  4-(methylnitrosamino)-4-(3-pyridyl)butyric acid (iso-NNAC) in tobacco smoke, an American blend and one French dark tobacco  nonfilter cigarette were spiked with nicotine, ~ nornicotine, |  cotinine, and iso-NNAC (10, 1, 2, and.0.1 mg/cig., respective- ly). Smoke generation, collection and partition were done ac- cording to a published method. The analysis of tobacco-specific nitrosamines. (TSNA),.nitrosamino acids (NA), and iso-NNAC in Mainstream smoke (MS) was done by gas chromatography with TEA. detection. The U.S. blended cigarettes spiked with iso-NNAC  yielded 950 ng/cig.. of iso-NNAC in MS. (0.95% transfer), while .  formation of iso-NNAC (2 ng/cig) was observed only in the MS of cigarettes spiked with cotinine. The latter finding suggets that iso-NNAC may be pyrosynthesized during smoking of ciga-  ‘rettes rich in cotinine. Data on iso-NNAC formation. ~rom coti- nine in tobacco plants and in vitro will be presented. The pos—  sibility of using iso-NNAC as a biomarker for the exposure to TSNA of active and passive smokers will be discussed.

Gustafson  PKG Re: Distribution Dear Bob:  Quite rightly, you people have been interested in the question of distribution on Sir Walter Raleigh products as we plan Sir Walter Raleigh brand strategies.  The table attached, prepared by Laura Amshoff, provides us with information we haven't had before.  In general, it shows that distribution is in pretty good shape on Aromatic within those sales departments where the Spring flight will run. It also confirms our belief that New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco  are disasters. Chicago is mediocre; Frank Sonego (Department Manager) has already, on his own initiative, worked with me to develop plans for improving brand distribution. His area stretches from central Indiana out through Quad cities.  While distribution, like advertising, can always be improved, I guess, it seems to me that our advertising will be reaching areas this spring where consumers can reasonably expect to go out and find Aromatic at their favorite stores. PKG's nicely designed promotion brochure will be a good aid for plugging  the distribution gaps where they do exist.  Sincerely,  dof “MFR  4 .  Michael McCue  a  ce: G. T. Reid J F. E. McKeown  J.

It may also present in the familiar distal form and also as a scroncgative spondyl- arthritis, and sometimes as both. At the moment, there~ fore, there is enough evidence for us to accept psoriatic arthritis as an entity distinct and apart from rheumatoid arthritis, even though the manifestations are often similar or identical and even though paticnts with classical rheumatoid arthritis may also have coexistent psoriasis. Patients with psoriatic arthritis should by definition be scroncgative and free from rheumatoid nodules. By splitting this disorder off from rheumatoid arthritis much more has been Jearnt about it, a5 these workers have clearly shown.  “Barber, HS, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseater, 1957, 16, 230.  * Gibberd, FB, Acts Rheumarclogica Scandinavica, 1905, 31, 62.  ® Vilanova, X, and Pinol, J, Xhcumacesra, 1951, 7, 197.  4 Wright, V, Annals of the Rhcumatie Diseases, 1956, 15, 348.  ® Coste, F, et al, Revue du Rhumatusme et des Maladies Ostéo-Articulaircs, 1958, 25, 75. ae  Roberts, MET, et al, Annals of the Rheumaue Diseases, 1976, 35, 206.  * Read, W B, Heiskell, C L, and Becker, SW, Archives of Dermatology, 1961, 83, 653. .  © Weight, V, Anials of the Rhewmatre Diseases, 1961, 20, 123.  ® Wright, V, Stutrock, R D, and Dick, W C, in Recent Advances in Rheumet- clogy, Part 2, eds W' W Buchanan and W C Dick, p 193.

Fetal breathing was depressed with the tobacco Cigarette and slightly less so with the nicotine chewing-gum. A more recent study has confirmed that fetal breathing move~ ments are reduced in association with cigarette smoking in normal and abnormal pregnancies." The reduction was related to the cise in maternal plasma nicotine levels. Non- nicotine (herbal) cigarettes produced similar rises in carboxy- hacmoglobin to those caused by tobacco cigarcttes but without a reduction in. fetal breathing. These studies are helpful in dissociating the influence of nicotine from that of . carbon monoxide in regard to this particular effect. Never- theless, it docs not follow that the effect on fetal respiration is of practical importance, though circumstantial evidence is accumulating that it may be.®  Thiocyanate concentrations are raised in the cord blood of infants born to smoking mothers,” while vitamin B,, levels are lower in smokers. This may reflect a disorder of cyanide detoxification"? related to the cyanide of the cigarette smoke. The lowered appetite which is a recognised concomitant of smoking may be responsible for a lower maternal calorific intake and hence tower fetal weight, but a review of the evidence in 1973 did not suggest that this mattered.’ Since then, however, other workers have suggested that impaired gain in maternal weight may be of importance."!

But smoking in pregnancy presents a special case. Firstly, it is a danger to the child as well as to the mother. Secondly, since pregnancy is of limited duration a woman who cannot be persuaded to give up smoking may actept a substitute at least while she is pregnant. It would be an advance if her craving . gould be met by a cigarette free from dangers to the babv. Accordingly, workers have tried to identify whe harmful components of tobacco smoke.  Carbon monoxide, nicotine, and cyanides are the factors which seem most likely to have ill effects on the fetus, Studics of carbon monoxide! ? have indicated that the inctease in carboxyhacmoglobin may deprive the fetus ofadequate oxygen. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the type of baby liable to be harmed by the mother’s smoking is the one already at risk for some other reason. Nevertheless, analysis of vesttiol excretion levels has suggested that hypoxia is not the main influence on retardation of fetal growth.

Smoking is best stopped before conception, but there is evidence that stopping in the first two months of pregnancy reduces the hazard.? Encouraging the mother to increase her food intake may be worth trying, burexcessive weight gain may be harmful, and at present a controlled trial of this approach seems called for.'® It is mothers in the lower social classes and with a poor obstetric performance whose babies are particularly at risk from smoking, and they might well be guided to special clinics so that maximal effort could be concentrated on them.

Also find included the response analysis chart.  The number of cartons produced for this offer was 1,745,000. The original response projection for this program was 11% and would have resulted in 16,000 coupon requests, or the submission of 192,000 cash pieces. Response to this program continues to be very good. As of October 22nd, we had received a total of 257,016 cash pieces from consumers, resulting in 21,418 free carton coupon requests. The response rate currently stands at 14.7%. Actual results have exceeded the original projection by a considerable amount.  Of the requests we received, 90% derived from the True filter packings and 10% from Menthol. Also of note, 36% of the respondents smoke 20 to 29 cigarettes per day. 27% of the respondents smoke over 40 cigarettes a day and 17% smoke from 30 to 39. 13% did not specify.  Also find enclosed the True Carton Cash Projected Response chart. This chart shows the original projection and the revised projection for this program and how they compare with the actual response. You will see that the actual response through October 224 (21,418) has already surpassed the October projection (21,215).  Upon your review of these reports, please contact me with any questions or if additional information is required.  DK/bh  CC: G. Baroody A. Pasheluk G. Telford S. Benson J. Young 8S. Smith J.

OC Walk-in Panel Extended Smoking Test of Two Trim Models  Purpose  The purpose of this test was to determine whether there were subjective differences with extended smoking of two ultraslim cigarettes: PM Trim 1 blend control, and the PM Trim 4 model with calcium carbonate, -42 perforated Paper, and CMC.  Methods  Sixty flavor-low smokers fxom the OC Walk-in Panel participated in this test. Each panelist was given one pack of the test cigarette and one pack of the control, and asked te smoke all cigarettes provided. They were then asked to evaluate the first and last cigarette from each pack on the attributes of mouth and throat impact, aftertaste, unusual flavor, mouthcoating, tobacco taste, and acceptability. Presentation order was balanced and analysis of variance was used to analyze the data.

(  Serum Proteins and Proteiri Electrephoretic Pattern in Normal Pygmy Goats  A. Castro, PhD; D. S. Dhindsa, BVSc&AH, PhD; A. S. Hoversland, PhD; J. Metcalfe, MD  SUMMARY  The values of total protein and protein electrophoretic patterns for Ppyemy gosts were studied to eatab- lish normal basic values. The values obtained in the present study were es follows: a:-globulin, 06 = 0.1 mg/dl; o-globulin, 1.0 = 0.3 mg/d}; @-globulin, 0.6 = 0.1 mg/dl; y-globulin, 1.6 = 0.1 mg/dl; total protein, 7.3 + 0.7 mg/dl; albumin, 3.2 + 0.6 mg/d); a/a ratio, 0.8 + 0.3 mg/dl; and globulin, 4.5 + 0.6 mg/dl.  Goats were divided into groups on the basis of age and sex to deter- mine if any sienifirant differences were present in these groups. Of the  variables studied, only albumin and 4/G ratio showed significantly different values due te sex; castrated males showed significantly lower values than those for intact males and females (P < 0.05). Also, a/c ratio values for females and cas- trated maie pygmy goats were sig- nificantly Jower than those for in- tact males (P < 0.05). Total serum protein values studied in female pygmy goats at various ages were also significantly different (P < 0.05).

To use any animal model for clinical studies, it is important to establish certain base lines. In the past 15 years, investigations have been carried out in several areas of these physiologic functions, e.g., cardiovascular studies,* repro- duction,° thyroid function,? and se- Tum electrolytes.’ At present, infor- imation is not available on serum proteins. ‘The present investigation was carried out to establish base lines for total serum protein and electrophoretic patterns of serum proteins.  Materials and Methods  The colony of pygmy goats under in- vestigation was established in 1964 at the University of Oregon Medical School (now the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center) with the pur- chase of foundation animals from zoo- logical suppliers.’ The animale had no access to succulent green feed. Diets eslublished as nutritionally adequate for other goats were used since nutei- tional requirements for pygmy goats have not been determined. The adult goats were given sun-cured alfalfa pellets fed ad libitum; fresh water and an iodized salt block were always available.  _ Nonpregnant female, castrated male,  and intact male pygmy goats, ranging trom less than 1 te 6 years of age were Studied. All goats were in good health dt the time of blood sample collection. They were divided into groups on the basis of age and sex to determine the presence of any significant differences within the groups.  Blood samples were collected in early morning into tubes (partial vacuum), containing no anticoagalant. Precautions were taken to prevent hemolysis. Samples were kept at room temperature until centrifugation. After centrifugation, the serum was trans- ferred to sterile vials and kept frozen at —20 C until analyzed.  The micro-Kjeldahl method” was  PUBLICATIONS  10326240  14E§  used for determination of tatal protein concentrations in the serums. Approxi- mately 4-:1 samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on 13.0- by 2.5-cm paper strips in a 0.07 M barbital buffer (pH 86) with g current of 0.4 to 0.5 mA/em width for 4 to 5 hours. The proteins were stained with ponceau-S, and the strips scanned by a double- reflectance method with a densitome- ter.”  Electrophoretic separation of serum proteins was accomplished by utilizing A modification of the paper electro-  phoresis system. A durrum-type, hang- Tha strip ‘cell which holds eight 3 by  20-cm paper strips and a power source* were used. Sérum samples (0.01 ml) were separated on Whatmann 3-mm  filter paper strips, using a barbital buf- for inl RAV with DOF innic eteeneth  A 3-mA current was maintained for 11 hours. The strips were then removed, dried, and stained for proteins with bromepheno! blue; cleared, dried, and read on a recording scanner and ins tegrator.®’ Anplyses were repeated wn- til duplicate samples ogreed within 3%. Reproducibility was satisfactory. Significant differences between group means based on sex and age were determined by using Student’a test for unequal sample size. A com- parison was considered significant if P values were less than, or equal to, 0.05.  Results  The average alpha-1 globulin for female pygmy goats was 0.6 + 0.4 mg/dl. The comparable value for intact males was 0.7 + 0.1 mg/ al, and for castrated moles, 0.7 = 0.05 mg/dl. The difference in a/c values between females aged 3 to 4 years and < 1 year were signif- icantly different (P < 0.05; Tables 1 and 2).

Tar Variations ~  New Brand Marketing agreed to open up the tar restraint of current 8 mg to within the FFLT category. Three ‘tar' categories will be investigated in order to determine the  effect 'tar' has on perception of CC taste, they are 5, 10, and 15 mg 'tar'. ‘  II. Pressure Drop of Cigarette 2  The current CC products were developed at approximately 120mm draft. In previous testing it was determined that in- creasing the pressure dropped produced a smoother and milder  taste. Two additional drafts at 140mm and 150-160mm will be investigated.  III. Blend Variations >  Previous testing with increased turkish tobacco indicated that an improvement may be made in taste with further increases.  Blends with 20% and 30% turkish tobacco and also elimination of G7 will be investigated.  IV.

CIGARETTE ADVERTISING AND "TARGETING"     "It is more accurate to observe that cigarette smoking among women led tobacco companies to advertise to the ’female market’ than to suggest that advertising created the market in the first place."  Prof. Michael Schudson University of California!  Cigarette advertising is "targeted" at adult smokers. Smokers, like consumers of other products, are not an undifferentiated mass. All sorts of people are smokers. Cigarette manufacturers, like manufacturers in other highly competitive markets, tailor their brand messages to those who consume their products. This is essential to the task of distinguishing the advertised brand from the multitude of other brands on the market.  The allegation that cigarette advertising improperly “targets” women, minorities and "low-income groups" carries more than a little condescension. No one ever has accused a cigarette manufacturer of improperly "targeting" white male yuppies -- even though advertising for some cigarette brands features models who fit that description. The assumption seems to be that women, minorities and "low- income groups" are less capable than affluent white males to determine andact in  their own best interests and must be "protected" by government censorship.        *M.

The information on the flavor loading in the LDPE is as follows:  e Naarden - contains a 25% flavor load. e Firmenich - contains a 50% flavor load. e IFF - no percentage of flavor was given. They suggested  running a 5% and 10% by weight of the flavored LDPE material.  Because all samples have different flavor loading levels, we will have  to use our best judgment for acquiring similar flavor levels on the finished product.

+        Formation of iron clusters in a mucous-like medium  Appendix B  Lawrence E. Reinstein®), Lisa Robinson, and Arvin S. Glicksman®)  Department of Radiation Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, 593 Eddy Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02902  ABSTRACT  In a recent paper based upon repeated magnetization studies done on the lungs of smokers and non-smokers who have inhaled small quantities of iron oxide powder, Cohen et al claim that the dust clearance ability of the ciga- rette smoker's lung is markedly impaired. A re-inter- pretation of this data which casts serfous doubt on the logic of Cohen's conclusion was suggested by Sterling and is based upon the hypothesis that during the magnet- jzation phase of Cohen's experiment, iron oxide "clus- ters" were preferentially formed in the highly mucous- filled environment of the smoker's bronchi.  In order to test this hypothesis, in-vitro expert ments have been performed to measure the mean "cluster“ diameter of iron oxide powder in a mucous-like liquid medium (methylcellulose) during and after magnetization as functions of the solution viscosity. Results of these measurements will be presented.  PACS number: 87.  In a recent paper based upon the results of magnet- ization studies of the lungs of smokers and non-smokers, Cohen et al(1) stated that the dust clearance ability of the cigarette smokers' Tungs is markedly impaired. Con- siderable doubt has been cast on this conclusion by Sterling(2) who has re-interpreted Cohen's magnetization data using the hypothesis that magnetic clusters were formed preferentially in smokers' bronchi, due to the presence of excessive sputun.(3) In order to test this new hypothesis in-vitro, exper iments have been performed to measure the diameter of iron oxide *strings"® and clusters formed in a mucous or sputum-like medium after magnetization.  It is clear that the validity of Cohen's conclus{on hinges upon the assumption that the iron oxide dust which remains in the subjects’ lungs after the magnet ization procedure, has identical physical characteristics in both smokers and non-smokers. While there is no simple way to demonstrate the truth of this assumption in-vivo, it is possible to show in-vitro that it is false and that, in fact, the experimental procedure itself may cause the fron oxide dust in smokers’ lungs to form clusters which cannot be easily cleared.  yi oS w oO & Ww ra w w __label__Scientific

“my  CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia To: Dr. Jerry Whidby, Mr. Richard Heretick Date: April 20, 1994  From: Ty Murray Wy  Subject: 5401-Project Tomorrow Development Qrtly     This memo summarizes the efforts of the Development Team for the first quarter 1994. The attached spreadsheet and graphs will summarize the current estimated manpower allocation and budget status.  Process Engineering and Material Testing  Replaced nylon tracks and modified metal shims to eliminate dripping on MOD. Machine runnability was greatly improved during a performance run conducted on 3/17/94.  Munising IV trials were conducted 3/7/94 to 3/23/94. Twenty-five banded papers were produced, Papers made of Avicel with 0% CMC had processing problems. The matrix was run with models containing Avicel with 4% and 8% CMC. Cigarettes made from these papers are in support of the cigarette design model.  MOD trials were conducted on 4/5/94 to 4/7/94 (outside end of first quarter but included by default ). The slurries consisted of 15 Eucalyptus and 2 Aspen wood pulps. A third Aspen paper was not produced due to slurry refinement problems. Cigarettes made from these papers are in support of the cigarette design model.  KC has indicated that they are considering 3% CMC, 6% PVOH, 3% Na Aiginate, and 3% Na Alginate plus Acid as their industry samples for banded papers using the gravure process. KC shipped bobbins on 13 April. The papers and cigarettes will begin evaluation/fabrication starting May.  Worked diligently to get KC on board with project management. Both parties have agreed to amonthly format. KC's manpower allocations continue to be a major concern. The goals and objectives of this project will be greatly jeopardized if these resources are not in place by April 22 ,1994,  Measurements and Methods Development  Trials on the rewinder table indicate that band inspection results are largely independent of rewinding speeds ( 67 to 295 m/min ). However, banded paper in which the slurry contained 20% calcium carbonate showed increased difficulty in band detection. DCS Corp. is working to optimize the signal to noise ratio. PM will also continue to evaluate additional banded paper configurations for detection anomalies.  The Fidus built PPM 400 ( used to measure permeability of cigarette papers from .5 to 50 +/- .1 Coresta ) is working well . This instrument is currently used to verify paper permeability during and after mill trials. Conversations with R&D and QA users with regards ta modifications for commercialization are forthcoming.

March 28, 1972° —  * . 3  Mr. William S. Smith  “Re: Maxwell Report (Page 5 Attached) .  -1. The attached document may seem rather long; however, it is essential . in this form to follow-through with the rational involved.  2, Claude Teague's summary on the first page and a half explains that apparently: .  _ (a) A gap exists in brands on the market because no cigarette has both oy . an acceptable Jevel of nicotine and a "tar"-to-nicotine ratio: (T/N Ratio) of less than 13. (T/N Ratio: divide FTC "tar" by FTC nicotine. )  . (b) Perhaps we should go for developing a cigarette delivering 1.3 mg. of -  nicotine and 13 mg. of "tar." _ ot -  “() This would provide a . product with a "desirable" T/N Ratio of 10.  3. Kool is the only brand that falls close to 13 at 13, 1% T/N Ratio; however, even this is substantially over the 10 that appears to be what we should be - | shotting for if the Maxvell Report is a reliable reference, Carlton's ratio - gives a , TIN Ratio of 10 ("tar" 4 mg., nicotine 0.4 mg.); however, at or near - our specified nicotine delivery value of 1.3 mg., there is no brand witha | oe TIN Ratio of less than 13. : vo Soe  4, Ate our specified nicotine level of 1.3 mg. the smoker must receive at. ne least 17 mg. of "tar" as applied to any current brand. No other option is is available -- which appears to be a gap and an unmet need, or marketing . Opportunity.

Small-biz owners fume over Council's ad ban  By Bop LirF Dally News Start Water  Small-business owners yes-  rday urged the City Council to reject a Proposed ban on cigaret ads near city schools and gathering places for kids, arguing that the Sweeping crackdown could snuff out their profits,  Advertising industry offi- cials also spoke out against the law Proposed by Couneil Speaker Peter Vallone (D- Queens) and Council Minority leader Tom Ognibene (R- Queens).  The bill, tougher than a pro-  3 posed federal crackdown on z cigaret ads, would ban Joe Ss el and other tobacco ads thin 1,000 feet of 4 school,  Up to $30 million a year in pro- * motional revenue that goes to gas and groceries, The  before “unreasonably burden. ing these 40,000 cigaret-sett- ing retailers.”  The American Advertising Federation warned that the bill violates constitutional guarantees protecting “truth. ful commercial speech.”  “Banning tobacco advertis- ing will do nothing to address the probiems of underage smoking,” federation officials  ‘said. “It sends an unmistak-  able message that New York City, the home of Madison Ay- enue, is hostile to advertis- ing.”  Vallone was unmoved by the lobbying. “We believe the Placement of tobacco adver- tisements close to Where kids congregate is a prime cause of the surge in Youth smoking,” he said.  Separately, consumer af.  irs officials yesterday an- nounced they will ask a Judge  fine 11 stores $1,000 each and yank their cigaret li- censes for a year.

The MCP-1 gene (for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) codes for the potent CC chemokine MCP-1 which hus been shown to play important rolcs in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. The MCP-1 protein can also be used in the adjuvant treatment of a number of malignancies.  Success in the areas discussed in this application will yield new insights into novel signal transduction pathways as well as a number of specific (DNA and protein) targets, important in transcriptional control, for future rational drug design.

Sue Tafur and | also met with QSE personnel to discuss conventional QA testing of shipments of low sidestream paper with experimental codes 10-994A, 10- 995A and 10-996A. It was decided that it would be sufficient to test only every fourth pallet for Coresta, CaCO3 and MKP. Initially, the Coresta will be measured at R&D while the possibility of getting a proper 10 cm? external clamp for Cabarrus is pursued.  Received samples from Roger Slagle for investigation of competitor (RJR) cigarettes in white packs. A testing plan was developed with Liz Chambers, and samples were distributed to PTL and General Analytical.  4A09 Support to Marketing/Market Research:  Supplied bobbins of 53 gim*, 9.5 Coresta low sidestream paper for additional {mg prototype production in Semiworks and sent for larger quantities of paper from the  pallet we had arranged for K-C to ship to the warehouse.  Requested cigarettes for 8-port testing and prepared the sampies for conditioning. Freddie Ford resmoked three of the earlier models after appropriate aging (1 week) of the cigarettes. The sidestream visibility reduction improved to ~44% versus the 3 day aging average of ~37%. The three models we resmoked were the  ones that had been selected as primary candidates.

os,  BRIGHT CONSUMER TRACKING AMONG BLACK SMOKERS  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  BACKGROUND  BRIGHT is an innovative low tar 85mm/100mm cigarette positioned primarily against menthol smokers. It is designed to deliver a unique new taste which is fresher during smoking and leaves a clean fresh aftertaste. BRIGHT entered test market in Michigan, Oklahoma, and Colorado on July 5, 1982.  Pre-market research has suggested that Black menthol smokers represent a potential incremental share opportunity for the Brand. As a part of the test  market research program developed for BRIGHT, the awareness, trial, purchase and repeat purchase levels for BRIGHT were tracked among Black menthol smokers in the Detroit Metro area. The acceptance and penetration levels of BRIGHT  among these smokers should provide direction for possible modification of the Brand's national marketing plan.  CONCLUSIONS  e Sampling was the most important source of initial brand awareness and trial for BRIGHT among Black smokers. Sampling may be particularly important in generating trial among Blacks in economically depressed areas.  e Trial was effectively converted into purchase of the Brand. By week fourteen, over one-half of all Black menthol smokers who had ever tried  BRIGHT had also purchased it. Repeat purchase averaged 37% over the  three tracking periods and appeared to be fairly stable over time. The appeal of the BRIGHT proposition was strongest among females, smokers  aged 25-34, and those earning less than $15,000.  e BRIGHT's unique taste appeared to result in polarized perceptions among  Black triers. The attributes most strongly liked were also most strongly disliked, which supports other research results. __label__Report
PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: R. Prasad ~~" "““Date: April 9, 1990  From: Cc. R. Howe and R. Southwick  Subject: Recovery of Tobacco Neutrals from Water Column Effluent  The removal of hydrophobic organic compounds from aqueous effluents is a well-known technology. For example, Bitteur and Rosset (J. Food Science  53, 141 (1988) describe the use of octadecyl-bonded silica (C-18) and styrene-divinylbenzene to recover blackcurrant aroma compounds from food plant waste water. These packings selectively retain organic compounds while inorganic salts and ionic organic compounds pass through unretained. We reasoned that the acidic water column effluent could be pumped through C- 18 packing and the organic "flavor" components could be retained while the protonated bases, e.g., nicotine, would pass through.  We have carried out an experiment to test this hypothesis (Notebook 8889-69). Specifically, to 1000g of ART MPC solution was added at room temperature 20g of Baker reversed phase packing (octadecylsilane bonded to silica gel, 40 micron particle diameter). This suspension was stirred vigorously for one hour and then filtered through a coarse fritted glass funnel. The solids (yellowish in color) were washed with two 500ml portions  of water. Nicotine analyses for the filtrate and washings were as follows:  Filtrate 27.719  lst Wash SO 675  2nd Wash .038 Total 28 .432¢  The nicotine content of the initial solution was 29.4g; thus nearly 97% of the nicotine passed through the packing.  After the second washing with water, the packing was air-dried for about 2 hours. The packing showed a weight gain of 0.25 grams. The dried packing was slurried with about 30ml 95% ethanol and filtered by suction. The packing was rinsed with two 10-ml portions of ethanol, at which point the packing was colorless. After drying the packing weighed 19.5g, probably due to mechanical loss. The yellow ethanol solution has a rich tobacco aroma and will be evaluated by the odor profile panel; it is available for subjective evaluation in cigarettes as well.  Since this result is so promising, we plan to perform additional experiments to evaluate the capacity of the C-18 packing. An alternate packing material is a styrene-divinylbenzene co-polymer.  We will order some of this material for studies to compare with the C- 18 data. The styrene-divinylbenzene packing can be used over a pH range of 1-14 whereas the C-18 is limited to pH 3-6 by its chemical reactivity.  SSTZtLA¢9¢ __label__Memo

This draft distilis thinking from Mark and Betty.  We would not suggest getting into how our cigarette brand names might be present in the Thai market. Any such discussion would need to take into account point-of-sale, including dispensers, etc., which could be characterized as “prominent” in Thai retail environments, and we can't say for certain that brand images that are not identified by brand name but are closely associated with the brand (e.g., a "Marlboro Country"-like Western scene), cannot be found in Thailand.

A detailed report will’ be -  available in late July.  Interviewing was undertaken in twelve northeastern cit4des among 404 menthol smokers and 102 young (18-24 years) Parliament smokers who occasionally smoke menthol cigarettes. The menthol smokers were broken out into the following groups:  o 147 full flavor king size smokers 0 161 flavor low king size smokers o 96 female flavor low 100’s smokers  The following points highlight the topline findings:  ° With the exception of the female 100’s smokers, Parliament Menthol did not appear to generate interest at the concept stage. Specifically, only one in ten of the Parliament and menthol king size smokers stated they would "definitely buy" the brand.  ° However, after trial, "definite" purchase interest levels doubled among both the king size and franchise smokers so that all four smoker groups exhibited similar levels of interest.  cc: D.

ANALYST IMPRESSIONS  I listened to several impromptumedia interviews of Analysts. In general, the Analysts' answers were precise, low-key and  favorable about the development.  They also refused to speculate on questions designed to  elicit a negative and/or controversial response.  John of the Wall Street Journal asked one analyst if this  product failed would it “be like the introduction of new.  Coke?" the answer was:  "Of course not; Coke withdrew a product and RJR is not doing that. Also this is nowhere near the same level of spending  and commitment.  Another analyst said it "is a good move because RJR has nothing to lose here. It's a technological advancement and  that puts them on the leading edge. But, if it doesn't fly  they have really not invested that much.  ui °o a _ wn Ww w ~ oO __label__Report

ee  ae  PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: - Mr. Leo Meyer Date: April 21, 1987 From: » Myron Johnston  Subject: . B&H King  At the March 13 meeting of the Benson and Hedges Task Force, I said I would look into the demographics of smokers of 80-85s who do not smoke our brands. I don’t think there is anybody in the company more enthusiastic than I about  the prospect of a B&H King (especially a menthol), and I have been pushing the idea at every opportunity for three or four years. Having said that, I  have to add a caveat: We have to be careful that we don’t shoot ourselves in the foot. We already own a good share of the nonmenthol 80-85 market.  Who Smokes Our Brands?  First a little background information. Figure 1 shows the total number of smokers, and the number who smoke a Philip Morris brand, by age of smoker and by length and type (menthol or nonmenthol) of cigarette. For all four length-type categories, @Q@esWar@ ST ‘market Ys: highest-anong the youngest# smokers and declines with age. Clearly this is the best position to be in, since there is a tendency for people to, stick within a brand name. This, combined with the increase in the absolute number of 18-34 year-olds from 1964 to 1984, is what fueled our growth in market share.      Figure 2 shows the total number of smokers of nonmenthol 80-85s and the number who smoke one of our brands, by age, sex, and race. Figure 3 shows the same data for menthols. I have deliberately put them both on the same scale to show the relative importance of menthols and nonmenthols among the various groups. Females are much more likely than males to smoke 100-120s, and, among males, blacks are more likely than whites to smoke 100-120s up to age 40, when the reverse becomes true. That explains the sex differences in the number of smokers of kings, and_some of the race differences. Also, as I have shown on many occasions, B¥eeks<avé mich wore Tikely than. whites £03 enoke “a henthol&  Who Doesn’t Smoke Our Nonmenthol 80-85s?  The areas vertically shaded in blue in Figures 2 and 3 can be considered windows of opportunity, with the size of the area directly proportional to the size of the opportunity. Quxcgreatest opportunities for nonmenthols. ‘exist among white males 25 to 54 and white females 35: to 44.4 Tt is inthe  ‘25-34 age group that males abandon Marlboro Red.

Some notes on K-ras mutations in lung cancer  The K-ras signal transduction pathway helps regulate proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, all of which are aberrant in cancer. The K-ras gene contains three mutation hotspots which occur at codons 12, 13, and 59-61, and a single point mutation at these sites may activate the K-ras gene. Codon 12 point mutations in K-ras are considered to be an important early stage genetic change in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but rarely occur in squamous cell carcinomas. K-ras mutations appear to be an independent prognostic factor indicating a poor prognosis, independent of stage and histology.  Most studies suggest that K-ras mutations occur in about 30% of lung adenocarcinomas in smokers, but are seldom present in adenocarcinomas from nonsmokers. Few K-ras mutations are found in adenocarcinoma of the lung with unknown etiology, or in nonsmokers exposed to radon. Keohavong ef al. (Clin. Cancer Res., 2, 411-418, 1996) reported 43 (33.9%) of 173 human lung tumors from a U.S. population to contain codon 12, 13 and 61 mutations. Of these, 41 (32%) of 127 adenocarcinomas contained mutations compared to only 1 squamous carcinoma (2.7%) and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma (11%); 24 of 40 codon 12 mutations consisted of GT transversions, 12 GoA transitions, 2 G-—C transversions, and 1 double GG—>TT mutation. Two G>T transversions were found in codon 13, and a single A->C transversion in codon 61. Husgafvel-Pursiainen ef al. (Int. J. Cancer, 53, 250-256, 1993) reported 14 (29%) of 48 Finish lung cancer cases to have K-ras mutations, of these 12 (57%) of 21 adenocarcinoma contained mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61. In a Dutch study, Slebos et al. (N. Engl. J. Med., 323, 561-565, 1990) reported 19 (27.5%) of 69 adenocarcinomas to have K-ras mutations .  K-ras mutations have also been suggested to occur in a significant number of squamous cell carcinomas. Rosell et al. (Clin. Cancer Res., 2, 1083-1086, 1996) have reported 57 (20.7%) of 275 consecutively treated Spanish stage I-IV NSCLCs patients had K-ras mutations in codons 12 and 61. Of these, 20 (26%) of 78 adenocarcinomas, 29 (18%) of 163 squamous cell carcinomas, and 8 (23.5%) of large cell undifferentiated carcinomas had K-ras mutations. Codon 12 mutations occurred in 53 (93%) of 57 tumors and were characterized by 14 coding changes from wild-type glycine (GGT) to valine (GTT), 13 to aspartic acid (GAT), 10 to cysteine (TGT), 8 to serine (AGT), 6 to arginine (CGT) and a single change to alanine (GCT). Only 3 (7%) of 57 K-ras mutations occurred at codon 61.  Most published studies have specifically investigated K-ras mutations in codon 12, because these are the most frequently detected ras mutations in adenocarcinoma of the lung. Analyzing only codon 12 mutations, Shiono et al. (Carcinogenesis, 17, 1683-1686, 1996) reported 10 (19%) of 53 adenocarcinomas in Japanese males and 2 (4%) of 51 adenocarcinomas in Japanese females to contain K-ras mutations. Of the 12 K-ras mutations, 7 (68%) were GT transversion, 3 (25%) were GA transitions and 2 (17%)  were GC transversions. Determining only codon 12 mutations results in a slight, but probably not significant, underestimation of the total frequency of K-ras mutations in lung  tumors.  Mutational activation of the K-ras gene is a rare event in most chemically-induced rat lung tumors (Belinsky et al., Environ Health Perspect., 105(Suppl. 4), 901-906, 1997): NNK  ETLVIIEIN™’ __label__Scientific

TO:  FROM:  RE:  This  December 22, 1986  J. A. Herberger  D. W. Shouse  1987 Federal Excise Tax Increase  provides a program recommendation to manage the impact of a  potential excise tax increase effective October 1, 1987.  I.  Il.  Overview     Consideration will be given in the 100th Congress to increasing the Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes in 1987.  RJR Public Affairs predicts that if an increase is in fact legislated, there is a 70% probability it would take effect October 1, 1987, and a 30% probability it would be effective July 1, 1987. In either case, the most likely increase will  be either 8¢ or 10¢ per pack.  Depending on the timing and magnitude of an increase, Industry volume is expected to decline 2.9% to 3.8% as a result. These declines are incremental to the forecast industry baseline trend (-1.7%). RIJRT volume is estimated to experience a commensurate decline with total Industry. This estimate is based on the fact that RJRT currently has its fair share, or 32.3% of the Savings Segment. Consequently, RJRT is expected to maintain share.  While RJRT volume should not decline disproportionately versus the total Industry, it is expected that a significant shift in Full Price vs. Savings Brand volume mix will occur. For example, under an 8¢ increase effective 10/1/87 scenario, RJR Full Price volume is projected to decline about 1.7 billion and Savings volume projected to increase by .4 billion. The shift in mix is more demonstrative for the full year 1988 as Full Price volume is down over 10 billion units with Savings volume up almost 5 billion.  1987 Volume/Profit Impact  Volume and profit impact of an FET increase and recommended action plan assume an 8¢ increase effective October 1, 1987, since this scenario appears to be most likely. Sensitivity analyses of other possible scenarios are included as  appendixes.  RIR volume is projected to decline 1,347MM units in 1987 as a result of an FET increase with losses on full-price brands offsetting gains on DORAL and CENTURY. This shift in mix results in a negative profit impact of $29.6M.  £7LO 8099S __label__Letter
REYNOLDS TOBACCO CALLS FOR COMMON SENSE REGARDING ADVERTISING ISSUES  The debate over cigarette advertising in magazines needs a big dose of common sense.  Critics of our advertising don’t want children to see cigarette ads in magazines published for and read by adults. However, the only way to guarantee that no child ever saw a cigarette ad would be to completely ban cigarette advertising.  The real issue is whether cigarettes should be treated as legal products for adults, and whether manufacturers have the right to communicate with adult smokers.  Cigarettes are already the most restricted consumer product in terms of marketing and advertising, but we have the legal right to advertise in adult smokers in publications that are not youth-oriented.  Does seeing a cigarette ad cause children -- or adults -- to begin smoking? Common sense tells you no. Government and university studies show that peer pressure and family influence are the primary factors in smoking initiation. And common sense tells you that the vast majority of tobacco messages that youth are exposed to today are anti- smoking messages.  So what would further restricting cigarette advertising — or banning it — accomplish? It would be one more step in attempting to make smoking more socially unacceptable — and once again, treating a legal product as if it were illegal. It would deprive cigarette manufacturers of a constitutional right, but it would not resolve the youth smoking issue.  Our standard is to advertise only in publications in which at least two-thirds of the readership is age 18 or older. Further, we evaluate the editorial content of the publications over time to be sure the topics covered are of interest to predominantly adult audiences. We review the other advertisers who appear in those publications to ensure that most are for products which primarily are purchased by adults. We also review factors such as the publications’ circulation dynamics and method of distribution.  The same magazines we advertise in carry ads for other adult products — such as alcohol, household appliances, and furniture. In 1998, the major tobacco companies signed an agreement with the States’ attorneys general that enacted sweeping bans and restrictions  on cigarette marketing. This agreement does not prohibit us from communicating with adults who choose to smoke.     £980 bOtcCS __label__Report

tf  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: 25 September, 1987  From: Barbro Goodman  Subject: CIGARETTES FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH  -  Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical Researcp pe and Cigarette Technology personnel, several cigarette models: were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke compositio The objective for the upcom«ng studies is to investigatf Ene effect of cigarette circumference and Mg(OH)2 wrapper. “érder to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes were made at thre e different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8 mm) each with a Yetandard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156) and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from  the same batch of tqbacco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered configuration. re  s The selected blend was the! current project TRIM blend with standard production components. DBC Brfght, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC and RL 150B was used. It cont ed no stems or expanded tobaccos, so that better looking ultra slim gigarettes could be produced. All samples had the same casing and affercut system.  The Hauni lab max was used for all thré€@"circumferences. Cellulose acetate filters were made with widely varying efficiencies in an effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries,within reasonable levels. The tables attached to this memo give analytical data for each of the models. As can be seen in Table ", the 17 mm configuration gave extremely high RTD’s for nonvefitilated cigarettes. This could have an effect on mainstréam puffing to a greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra slim prototypes typically have RTD!s above 6" water for 45 - 55%  filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for the slim cigarettes.  Tables II and III give the calculated differences in data for each circumference with the commercial and the low sidestream wrappers at standard circumference as controls.  SLLE98PL0E __label__Memo

FARRELL :  Deputy Commissioner  : July 5, 2000  Mr. Robert P. Andree East Hill CITGO  301 Pinetree Road Ithaca, New York 14850  Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA) Dear Mr, Andree:  You have contacted us in regard to the legality of certain cigarette manufacturers’ promotions under the Cigarette Marketing Standards Act (CMSA). This letter is in response to that inquiry.  As you are aware, the Department issued TSB-M-00 (2)M on March 3, 2000 stating that certain manufacturers’ promotional programs known as “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs are prohibited under CMSA. Please reference that memorandum for details. It is the Department’s view that any change with regard to “buy-downs” and “master-type” programs would require statutory change by the Legislature.  Pursuant to longstanding interpretations of CMSA, the industry has offered other types of promotional programs, including price reductions and trade discounts provided for on the manufacturer’s invoice and “buy one, get one free” (or buy some, get some free) promotions, These programs continue to be allowed under CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount or price reduction {including any price reduction duc to free product) is reflected on the manufacturer’ s invoice; (2) all cigarette tax agents selling the manufacturer’s brands in New-York State are allowed to participate in the promotion; and (3) the promotion is not limited to specified retail dealers (other than for purposes of proportional allocation of available supply of promotional product). The industry has also offered manufacturer's coupons. These are allowable under CMSA, provided that the coupon is either published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation, or mailed directly to the consumer by the manufacturer.  58ZL esezs __label__Letter

The control was directionally preferred for longer lasting flavor. This test was con- ducted to determine if the natural prune concentrate could be reduced significantly in the event of a crop failure.  Je Water Solubles Analysis of G-7 - Levels of extract were varied to determine  the correlation between water solubles in G-7 and filling value. Correla- tion curves which can be used to predict the increase in filling value as extract levels decrease are now available. At this time, lowering the water solubles content of G-7 to increase filling value and thereby reduce costs does not appear to be feasible due to the lack of availability of the addi- tional stems’and scrap required to make G-7 with less water solubles. However, the possibility of eliminating the G-9 dust extract as a means  of improving G-7 uniformity and quality is under investigation.

Extra handsheets of 10% CaCO, paper were requested today, as there is some question ws LA 3 ; about the acceptability of TiO, in overwraps. Both paper types had better opacity than the  innerwrap-type paper now being used.  Severali samples of coated mat perforated to different porosities at K-C were received. K-C’s hole pattern is more widely spaced than the pattern used in the present cartridges. Controll cartridges without perforated mat, cartridges with the lab perforated mat, and cartridges from the four levels of K-C perforated mat are being prepared for machine.smoking TPM delivery.  A secondiset of samples has been machine smokedito compare effects of lab perforation vs no mat perforation, laminated vs unlaminated calendered. overwrap, and calendered vs uncalendered' laminated overwrap (P9TS innerwrap), TPM was greater with perforated mat. There was only a marginal difference between laminated and unlaminated calendered' papers. For this particular paper, calendering also improvedidelivery slightly. Calendering would have less of an effect with lower porosity overwraps. These data support the need: for mat perforation, the degree of perforation needed should be better known. after smoking the K-C set of perforated samples.  IJ.

RJR Interoffice Memorandum  SUBJECT: Proposal to HRRC for Sensory DATE: March 10, 1989 Evaluation of Vantage Excel 100 Cigarettes Prepared with Low Sidestream Paper Containing Boron  TO: Dr. John H. Reynolds, IV FROM: Patricia F. Perfetti  I would appreciate consideration by you and the HRRC of the following proposal to request consumers to smoke Vantage Excel 100 and one test VRP prototype prepared with cigarette wrappers containing low levels of boron.  Background:  Vantage Excel 100 entered test market January 31, 1989. Although consumers are very enthusiastic about the taste and product concept, numerous written and verbal complaints have been received by RJRT regarding the "messy, fly-away nature of the ash". It is paramount that the ash be improved immediately to insure the success of the brand. Two prototypes (described below) have been prepared with modified VRP low sidestream paper with the intent of improving ash cohesiveness.  Need For Human Subjects:  Unbiased human subjects are required in order to determine if the ash improvements demonstrated by either prototype are significant enough to be noticed by the typical consumer.  Scientific Affairs Review:     Memorandum attached (Rhenda Steele to Pat Perfetti, March 10, 1989). The conclusion is that boric acid and sodium tetraborate decahydrate are approved for further review by the HRRC. Also, attached is information from the U.K. Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (Fourth Report, 1988).  ol ps Ss 8 ~l N a eo & __label__Letter

RJR CONFIDENTIAL  To: Kathleen Gallivan Bill Proctor  From: — Ed Hardman  Subject: SIS Pricing System  Date: — July 17, 1995  This requests your help with an analysis (0 evaluate a tactical change to the execution of our pricing strategies.  Baekground:     Jim Maguire has suggested we simplify the execution of the pricing strategies by determining a division- wide discount value for our FP brands rather than the rep determining the discount valuc on a store by store basis. In order to evaluate that tactical change, we want to simulate it first.  Methodology: * — Sort stores by division, and class of trade within division (SM, CG, CO, and all other ex MB)  © For cach class of trade within division, calculate the average discount value needed to obtain a $0,35/53.50 price gap vs Branded Savings across stores in which the rep has exccnted a discount. Round the simulated discount value to the nearest nickel for packs and the nearest $0.50 for cartons, If the rep has not executed a discount, do not include that store in the average and do not substitute an average discount valuc for that store. The discount value for stores in which the rep has not exccuted a discount should remain zero.  * For each store in cach class of trade/division combination, substitute the average discount value for the discount value actually worked. (Again if the discount value is zero, it should remain zero.) Recalculate the net price in cach store bascd on the simulated discount value.  * Create a dummy database just ke the real database but with simulated values for discounts and net prices.  e¢ ~=Run our current grid store only reports against the dummy database to enable BIAD comparisons of the simulated reporls vs the actual current reports. This will enable us to evaluate the impact of the tactical change on the data and very importantly enable us to estimate the financial impact.  1 don’t know how this request compares (o priorities outside the pricing system. Ernic indicates that Jim  Maguire asks him about this daily. Therefore, Ernic has asked that we complete this analysis by the end of the week,  Ed  Ed Hardman Business Information and Analysis  cc Frank Beck/Bill Whitlatch/Jerry Moore/Peggy Fulk  €€cs8 ooses  RJRO00000050300531 9 70019 4299 __label__Email

In addition to contacting the superintendent for parent-employee-community and business engagement (Dr. Jewel Jackson, | believe), you might want to contact the Richmond Behavioral Health  Authority (RBHA). This agency provides prevention services to the public schools--they currently do Botvin's Life Skills program in a number of elementary schools. The director of prevention is Freda McNeal; her number is 819-4030. This arrangement works very well, as RBHA provides services, but is not under the authority of the superintendent.

RIRT INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  Subject: Freon 123/Freon 11 Date: April 10, 1990 Residue Decay  Study in Packaged Cigarettes  To: Michael F. Borgerding From: Rhenda H. Steele  At RJRT, once tobacco is expanded, this tobacco can be used to make cigarettes in approximately two to six hours. Once cigarettes are made, the cigarettes can be in the consumer's hand in as little as three to four weeks, although the industry average is three to four months. With these times in mind, the  following sampling points have been chosen for the packaged cigarette residue decay study:  Day 0 (remove cigarettes from freezer) Day 1  Day 4  Day 7 (1 week)  Day 14  Day 21  Day 28 (1 month) Day 42  Day 56 (2 months) Day 70  Day 84 (3 months).  These data are needed in order to estimate smoker exposure to Freon 123 by the August decision date. It is understood that this study will probably need to be repeated once PT&D optimizes the Freon 123 expansion process in order to obtain a more accurate curve for consumer exposure assessment.  cc: A.

Woods From: Ronald Sells  Project No.: 2938  Project Title: Product Evaluation Service for MRD  These cigarettes were manufactured in April, 1977 at Durham and are from the California market. These are the first Carlton 100's to be examined, The pack advertises 5 mgs. tar and 0.5 mg. nicotine.  The total cigarette length is approximately 100 mm. and includes a 27 mn. cellulose acetate filter plug which has a denier of 3.1 with an "I" cross section. The tipping is 32 mm. of white paper which is perforated by 2 rows of 27 each. The cigarette paper is not perforated and is a low porosity type.  The blend consists of burley, flue-cured, turkish, and G-7 with an average of 37.2 percent of these tobaccos being expanded.  The cigarettes smoke mild and with a weak tobacco flavor. The top note is a slightly high level of a sweet, coumarin-like flavor which is characteristic of several other American products. The cigarettes have considerably more taste than the 85 mm. version, however, the flavor is still somewhat flat. The over-  all smoking qualities are rated fair.  ols Ronald Sells  /v1  St60 LENDS     RJIRI FORM 2422—Rev. 7/70  aa __label__Report

And, all ir all, it's proving to be a bad time for mice and a confusing time for smokers. .  4 San Francisco pharmacologist threw a new fagot in the fire at a weekend press con- ferencs, the resulls of which wero held for re- levse until yesterday afternoon.  Dr. B. L. Freedlander of Mount Zion Hos- pital and Medical Center said he has found a relationship--in mice— between the [ack of an Important vitamin and cancer. He now has an experiment underway to find out if this may be tied in with a substance found in tobacco.  Dr. Freedlander's announcement comes on top of a disclosure a few days earlier by sci- enttatg at New York University that they had proved that tobacco tar “unquestionably”? con- tning a cancer-causing substance. However, ef- forts to prove that it can cause lung cancer have met with fa'‘lure.  Third Scientist's Testa  And a third scientist in Maryland, also working with mice, suggests that giving up smoking to stave off lung cancer may increase @ person's chances of getting some other type of cancer.  Dr. Freedlander, as had the other scten- lista, disclosed the details of his experiments on mice to a group of newsmen now touring the nation’s cancer research centera under the guidance of the American Cancer Society.  So far, the only evidence that smoking has 4 connection wilh lung cancer are statistical studies made of groups of smokers and non- amokers. The sludies show that smokers have a higher incidence of lung cancer than non- smokers and that groups of heavy smokers have a higher incidence of lung cancer than average or light smokers. Since the sludies were released in 1954, researchera have been striving to find laboratory proof that smoking can cause lung cancer. The proof, say the re- searchers, hag not yet been found.  Scakesmen for [he fobacea infuairy howe emphasized that a slatistical connection daeo hot establish a cause and effect relatsonsarp. they also note that many cther possibly can. cer-causing cOmpounds are inhaled particu. tarly In cities.  Experiment With Nlocin  In his experiment, Dr. Freedlander safd that he and an aasociate. Frederic A. French, have keen feeding a group of mice a diet de- ficient in Niacin, one of the B vitamins. Another group of mice was given a normal diet. The mice were bred especially to be susceptible to a type of lung cancer—a type not found in humans—and both groups were given a dose of cancer-causing chemicals to in- sure that they developed cancers,  The mice on the niacin deficient diet devel- oped an average of 19 tumors each, Dr. Freed- lander said. The mice on the normal diet developed only 11 per mouse, strong evidence that a lack of niacin increases the suscepti-  bility to cancer, he explained.  Tue two are now carrying their experiment further to check any connection with smoking. They have found a substance in tobacco which is chemically similar to niacin. ‘This substance, called 3-AP, can be converted to useful niacin in the liver, Dr. Freedlander explained. But, he theorizea, if 3-AP is inhaled It apparently by-passes the liver and !s loose in the body as @ false vitamin which living cells may confuse with the true vitamin.  Does the 3-AP sneak into a cell posing as a vitamin and then sabotage the cell causing eancer? Dr. Freedlander says he has still an- other experiment under way to find out.  Test With Vapor  He is giving the 3-AP tn vapor form—not amvuke-—for the mice to inhale to see if this increases the number of lung cancers in the rodents.  “We haven't proved anything yet,”’ he cau- tions. ‘‘There may be no relation between mice lung cancers and human lung cancera."’ And, he adda, ''It may be just a coincidence that it is a lung cancer the mice develop.”  Newsmen, many of them smoking. re- peatedly asked the scientist if thia meant it would help smokers to take niacin tableta in the hope it would offset the effects of 3-AP in cigaret smoke. He steadfastly refused to jump to any such conclusion, emphasizing his experiments were on mice and had proved nothing yet except that mice who do not get  HTB0037318  enough niacin are more susceptible to lung cancer.  The reason for using mice, he cxplains, is that, they are the best indicators of whether a& compound could be carclogenle (cancer  causing). A New York University scientist, Dr. Nor-  ton Nelson, told the newsmen that “unques- Uonably there is something carclogenic in to- bacco tar, thought it is very weak." He bases his conclusion on experiments where the skins of mice were painted with heavy doses of tobacco tar over a long period of time. They  developed skin cancer. He and another N.Y-.U. scientist note, how-  ever, that after a year of using a new method of knducing lung cancer in animals they have failed to produce any lung tumors with tobacco tar.  Researchers Frustrated  The fact that they have not beer able to cause cancer wi.h tobacco tar anywhere except on the skin of a mouse has frustrated many of the researchers. On the smoking question however, Dr. Irena Koprowska, a pathologist at the Hahnemann Medicai College and Hospi- tal in Philadelphia, told the newsmen a few days ago that she had produced cancer of the cervix in mice with tobacco tar. Tc do so, she had t¢ gently the tar to mice five times a week over a pericd of 10 months. ‘This still leaves uhanswered Ue question of whether tar will cause cance? In the lung.  at the University of Maryland. Dr. Frank H. J. Figge. has come up with another alrange hypothesis about smoking and lung cancer. He has been working on several experiments on the susceptibitty of mice to cancer, including cross-breeding of several different mice strains to check a theory that obesity increases sus- ceptibility to liver cancer.  In one experiment, Dr. Figge says he found that when he suppressed the susceptibility to breast cancer the mice became more suscep- tible to leukemia. His conclusion:  “We do not know enough about the variation in cancer-susceptidility of human subjects to advise them to give up smoking in the attempt to decrease the incidence of lung cancer, for we do not know for sure that giving up smoking may not slimulate factors associated with sus: ceptibility to other forms of cancer.” He adds, with pa grin at smoking newsmen, “If I smoked, I wouldn't give it up now." __label__News

January 22, 1981  MEMORANDUM  TO: W. T. Hoyt CC: WDH RFG  FROM: Leonard S. Zahn WUG RCH  SUBJECT: American Heart Association Miami, Nov. 17-20, 1980  The AHA's annual session has become one of the largest med- ical meetings in the world. This session had about 1400 pre- sentations and a huge display of drug companies and equipment manufacturers. The size and complexity of the event prompted the association's program committee chairman, in a speech on "Science and Advertising," to point out certain aspects that he said were adversely affecting the organization. He specif- ically criticized drug companies that sponsored their own sem- inars and special events at various hotels to promote certain . drugs, and he even took a general swipe at scientists who en- gage in "advertising" to promote their own findings or hypo- theses with insufficient data.  The press, which was well represented, discussed this in terms of washing dirty linen, but wrote nothing about it. Nor did the writers express other than casual interest in the sev- eral reports dealing with various aspects of smoking or the press conferences that. contained the usual antismoking comments.  It is likely that the heart association will increase its antismoking activities in 1981 because of its new president,  James Schoenberger of Chicago. . ee d - The highlights:  1.

I have no intention on lowering the voice of Camel and Kamel and think it would be a mistake for Winston to pull out of books that are more non-mentho! driven and edgier. Time-Out is still a great magazine for the brand and so are all the others mentioned below. All the other books mentioned below should also stay on plan and have more Camel and Kamel impact. By leaving these books I am only raising Marlboro's share of voice. I will be fired or I should quit if New York share for Camel and Kamel does not grow. I have to have better, more impactful advertising.  Salem has a great challenge ahead, but the ONLY thing that will work for Salem is having more impactful creative. Having Mela - Alem on billboards and POS means nothing along with the ORB which has no equity. To suggest taking the foot off the pedal for Camel and Winston with strong equities to make room for Mela - Alem and the Orb is absolutly wrong. New York if anything needs more Camel impact.

PROJECT NUMBER: 4009 i a PROJECT TITLE: Smoke Studies  PROJECT LEADER: B. L. Goodman  WRITTEN BY: B. L. Floyd  PERIOD COVERED: February, 1989  Objective: Develop subjectively acceptable cigarettes with reduced sidestream visibility.  Status: Doublewrapped models of 17.0 mm circumference cigarettes were made with perforated and nonperforated outer wrap to determine the effect of perforation on analytical and subjective results and sidestream visibility. Analytically there were no major differences, and the sidestream panel saw. no significant differences. However, several expert smokers found a difference in RTD between the samples, and it was felt that the nonperforated outer wrap resulted in RTD that is unacceptably high. The nonperforated outer wrap also resulted in a slightly higher reduction in sidestream visibility.  Samples of Trim V outer and inner liner were submitted for chemical analysis to determine process variation. Citrate levels on the inner liner were consistent. with expected values and represented acceptable variation. Phosphate levels on the outer wrap were also consistent; succinate levels on the outer wrap were found to be lower than levels reported by K-C.  Regular circumference cigarette models containing high and low levels of MAP were evaluated by the sidestream panel, and the low level sample was preferred. Several different types of CMC were also evaluated (NH, CMC, KCMC, CaCMC) and were found to be subjectively unacceptable.  The low sidestream 2A blend was modified for logistical  purposes. Various models were made in a 24.0 mm circumference configuration using this modified blend and with the existing low sidestream blend several of these models had charcoal filters at varying loading levels. The sidestream panel evaluated these cigarettes and felt that a 30 mg charcoal loading resulted in a better smoke with the 2A blend. A charcoal filter does not appear to offer the same advantage for the modified 2A blend.  The 8-port visibility instrument was installed in a lab in the cI area, and it has been used in trial runs. There is very good correlation between manually calculated light extinction data and results automatically generated by the PC attached to the 8-port instrument. Computerization of the single port has shown larger differences in data, compared to previous light extinction values from bit pad analysis. Several modifications to the PC collection methodology have been made by CAD.  14  ‘s 1 ‘  sey  S  _ bstzz.tzzoz __label__Scientific

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  As part of its overall strategy to compete with savings brands, DORAL has been using coupons to be competitively priced with private label brands. However, since coupons do not always reach all target adult smokers, the brand is considering revising its pricing strategy to an everyday price of $.30 below full- priced brands.  The issue has been raised about the effect of this change in pricing strategy on the image of DORAL, specifically would this everyday pricing strategy cheapen brand image.  Research has been proposed to determine the effect of this change in pricing Strategy on the image of DORAL. The specific objectives of the research would be to determine the effect of dropping the price below that of full-priced brands on:  e Interest in the brand  e Image of the brand, and  e image of the brand user.

In a population four times that of the Japanese study and over a longer period, the American Cancer Society's chief statistician has disclosed that "nonsmokers married to smoking husbands showed no increased risk of cancer compared to non- smoking women married to nonsmoking husbands."  The U.S. report, by Lawrence Garfinkel, appearing in the May issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is based on a follow-up of more than a million Americans enrolled two decades ago by Cancer Society volunteers.  The Japanese study, authored by Takeshi Hirayama, a Japanese government statistician, appeared last January in the British Medical Journal. It produced a rash of news stories, editorials and demands for smoking prohibitions, from writers and others who presumed its accuracy.  Hirayama's reported findings among some 265,000 residents in parts of his country showed a reported lung cancer death rate of 10.4 per hundred thousand among women whose husbands do not smoke and 14.6 for women whose husbands are smokers.  By implication, Hirayama's data projected an even higher rate -- 18 -- for single women. But he failed to report on either smoking or lung cancer rates among the substantial number of single women in his study population. However, if these do not  differ from married women's rates, the Japanese experience can be  TI1031-0980 __label__Report

IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION, “WHAT IS THE RISK," YOU ARE ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION  Bernhardt Lieberman* and Stephen Feingold**  * Departments of Sociology and Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15260, USA ** Department of History, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, 15213, USA  ABSTRACT A recent editorial in an influential journal on "The Great  Overcoat Scare," while satirical, presented a serious condemnation  of false accusations of menace against substances of everyday  lifel. Here we discuss and reveal the social bias and the violations of the norms of science present in the literature linking environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to lung cancer. We stress the importance of including social inquiry in risk analyses  and question the adequacy of "scientific" risk analysis.  Yes its rotten science but it's in a worthy cause.  It will help us get rid of cigarettes and become a  smoke-free society.

TR nrar-orjice ajamorandum  Subject:  To:  Comparison of Silastic 731RTV Date: June 26, 1974 and 732RTV Sealants  Mr. E. L. Hall From: Larry A. Lyerly Machine Shop Research Department  Samples of the two sealants were removed from the tubes and allowed to cure for several days. They were burned in special sample cells for analysis by infrared spectroscopy. The pyrolysis products from the two samples appeared to be the same although variations in intensities of the products occurred. The infrared spectra of the vapor phases suggest the presence of small amounts , of hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and monoxide, acetic acid, and with somewhat larger concentrations of silicones. The residue after burning appears to be essentially silicon dioxide (sand).  During our conversation about the sealants, you mentioned that 731RTV had been approved for your use as a gasket material. Accordingly, the results of our analyses indicate that the 732RTV should be equally acceptable. I recommend that neither material be used in places where contamination in tobacco would likely occur. For example, use on moving machine parts where wear would result  in probable contamination in tobacco should be avoided.  Attached are data sheets received from Dow Corning regarding the status of Silastic 732RTV under Federal Food and Drug Administration Regulations and the National Sanitation Foundation. Note that when thoroughly cured and washed, 732RTV has been approved under FDA Regulation No. 121.2562 dealing with rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Under the NSF Code, 732RTV has been approved for use in the splash zone and 731RTV in the food zone.  LAL/bmg Attachments Copies to:  Dr. C. E. Teague, Jr. Dr. J. T.

oF  From:  Subject:  ¢  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. CONFIDENTIAL id He L 1”! INTER -OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 100 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017  Mr. d.d. Morgan Date: September 18, 1980  Marketing Research Department  Cigarette Brand Shares - July 1980  July's Industry sales were off 4.3% versus 1979 (- 6.3% calendar adjusted} due to a price increase last year. Likewise, reflecting the price increase, year-to-date Industry figures were 1.1% below 1979 levels, and 1.4% behind when calendar adjusted. Year-to-date comparisons through August are expected to be more representative of the Industry's performance.  Philip Morris (30.9) recorded a slight decline for the month, as did Brown & Willfamson (13.6). R.dJ. Reynolds (32.7), affected by the combination of the discontinuation of Winston Menthol 100's, Salem Box, Real and Tempo, and the national introduction of Salem Ultras, had  a smal] increase. American (10.7) and Lorillard (9.8) also gained some Share. Liggett & Myers (2.3) remained unchanged.  Among the leading brands, Marlboro (17.7) retreated from last month's high, Declines were also evident in Winston (13.2) and Kool (8.9),  Salem (9.1) enjoyed the largest increase due to the launch of Salem Ultras (0.6). Other gainers included Merit (4.3), Kent (5.0) and Camel (4.3). B&H 100's (4.4), Pall Mall (5.2) and Vantage (3.7) held steady.  The Low Tar category tar level groups (Chart 6) have been revised from O-5mg. and 6-9mg., to O-6mq. and 7-9mg., respectively, to include Vantage Ultra Lights (6mg.) and Salem Ultras (5mg. Kings, 6mq. 100's) in the Ultra Low Tar category.  The Low Tar category (41.5) surged in July aided by new Salem Ultra.  Low Tar 80/85's (24.3), Low Tar 100/120's (17.3) and Menthol Low Tar (13.0) all registered share increases. The Non-Menthol Low Tar category (28.6)  was unchanged. Among the recent new Low Tar entries, Cambridge and Now 100's  recorded .3 shares, and Carlton 100's Box had a .2 share.  Of the other major categories, Total Menthol (28.9) and Total 100's (31.8) increased. Total 80/85's (58.1) declined slightly.  Jo Jo  UNZ: man Attachments  CISPO’  an  OFS __label__Memo

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.  . INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Ait Vee TMS Richmond, Virginia pet ate To: Ms. R.. D. Kinser Date: 4 April 1991 From: A: H.. Warfield, S. A. Haut, C.. K. Keene, and W. R. Morgan  Subject: Current Theoretical Considerations on the: Origin of MS NNK from Water-Washed Fillers and Basewebs  Hot water washing (as in the RL process) results: in base webs (BWs): with greatly reduced MS NNN and NAT levels relative to: corresponding levels from feedstock, but MS NNK levels are not reduced! by this process." The same phenomenon occurs when: cut fliller is exhaustively washed with water at room temperature.” The MS NNK delivered by water-washed fillers and BWs: has been referred to as pyrosynthetic NNK. 7 ,  The pyrosynthetic formation off TSNA. in MS smoke has been studied for’ several years by Project 6908.° Although not included in official. documenta- tion previously, the most common hypothesis used to explain the failure of water extraction to remove the source of MS NNK was as follows: there is a water-insoluble amine precursor remaining in the extracted filler which reacts with a nitrosating agent, also derived from a water-insoluble source, to: form NNK. The water-insoluble amine precursor undergoes pyrolytic clea- vage,. either before or after nitrosation, and then the NNK transfers to MS. Alternatively, bound nicotine itself may be nitrosated during smoking. None of the above theories include any explanation of how or when. these MS NNK precursors are formed.. As. a result. of recent discussions in Project 6908, a new hypothesis has been advanced which encompasses. most of the previous theories as well. as. some new. ideas. The current hypothesis. is stated. below:  Some of the nicotine present in tobacco becomes bound before curing is complete. Part of the bound nicotine is oxidized to bound pseudooxynicotine (PsON) or a related NNK precursor, and at least'a portion of this bound precursor is nitrosated during curing to yield bound NNK, while a portion may remain in nitrosatable form. Water extraction does not remove ail bound NNK or the remaining bound NNK precursors.. NNK is released from the bound form and is also pyrosynthesized from bound NNK precursors (or from bound nicotine) during smoking, and the total NNK released partially transfers as MS NNK or is decomposed ‘during the smoking process.  In the remainder of this memo,. the derivation of the above: hypothesis is described, and! plans that have been. made to substantiate: these concepts are: briefly presented.     eS2z.80Tecoe __label__Memo

Nested Discontinuity - Gabriel Kaufmann  NESTED DISCONTINUITY: A MODEL FOR LAGGING DNA STRAND SYNTHESIS  1. Synopsis  Three genetically distinct DNA polymerases, pols a, 6 and €, are implicated in eucaryotic chromosome replication. Yet how they collaborate is incompletely understooa (1). According to a model based on studies with a soluble 5V40 replication system, pol a@-primase synthesizes Okazaki pieces and also initiates replication at the origin. Leading strand elongation is delegated to pol § (2-4). This model assigns no function to pol € nor explains how sequence fidelity is maintained without a proof- reading function in the lagging strand DNA polymerase.  The notion that lagging strand DNA synthesis is mediated solely by pol a-primase has been questioned by us. We proposed instead that an Okazaki piece arises by ligation of shorter precursor chains and that two DNA polymerases partake in its Synthesis (5,6). According to this Nested Discontinuity Model (ref. 6, Fig. 7), pol a-primase synthesizes RNA primers (iRNA) and extends them with dNMPs to generate DNA primers below 40 nt. Several DNA primers assemble then into an Okazaki piece in a process which entails removal of ARNA, gap-filling by pol &§ or pol ¢€ and ligation. A mature Okazaki piece joins then onto a growing long chain. These conclusions are based on two types of evidence: a) the ability to distinguish between synthesis of DNA primers and their conversion into Okazaki pieces with specific inhibitors and b) the configuration of DNA primers in replicating DNA. Thus, pol a-specific agents such as BuPdcTp (7) and pol a- specific monoclonal antibodies selectively inhibit DNA primer synthesis. In contrast, COMDP, which inhibits pol 6 or pol e with greater potency than pol a (8,9), slows down the synthesis of Okazaki pieces without affecting DNA primer synthesis (our unpublished results). We have also demonstrated that DNA primers configure on the lagging template as a contiguous- or near- contiguous array by enzymatic manipulations of isolated replicating sv4o DNA, using Klenow polymerase, MMTV reverse transcriptase and T4 DNA ligase (5 and our unpublished results).  2. Outline of plans anda goals of the proposed research  Our goal is to test the basic tenets of the Nested Discontinuity Model. Specific issues addressed are the order of events in Okazaki piece assembly and the identity of enzymes involved in these steps. Regarding the first issue we consider two opposing scenarios. In one, DNA primers are deposited throughout the Okazaki range prior to further processing steps of ARNA removal, gap-filling and ligation (serial mechanism). Alternatively, processing closely follows deposition (parallel mechanism). We also ask what are the polarities of deposition and processing. our unpublished results suggest a 5!' to 3' order of deposition. This would also be the order of processing ina parallel mechanism. A serial mechanism is compatible with processing in either polarity (see also Fig. 1). Regarding the second issue we ask which DNA polymerase, § or €, catalyzes gap filling; which DNA ligase, I or II, catlyzes DNA primer ligation and whether the same enzyme ligates Okazaki pieces. __label__Scientific

HKS2191064  THE EFFECT OF TDSPARIN ON TESTOSTERONE SYNTHESIS IN SYRLAN GOLDEN HAMSTERS AND SPRAGUS-DAWLEY RATS  Norman lL. Block, Freda Camuzsi, Waiter Voiqt, and Albert Castro*  Departments of Pathology, Urology and Hormone Research Laboratory University of Miami School of Medicine Miami, Florida  ABSTRACT     Bicchemical entagonism between heparin and ascorbic acid was described (Owen et. al., 1970). Ascorbic acid is found in high concentrations in adrenal and testicular tissue and piays an important role in steroid synthesis in these tissues. To determine  s ts antagonism with ascorbic acid, levels of testosterone were s led in testi- cular tissue of adult male Syrian golden hamsters and in testicular plasma of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats auring heparin treatment.  To determine concentrations of testosterone in tissue the double isotepe derivative assay method was used, Radioimmunoassay was used to detexmine testosterone concentrations in plasme., Wo inhibitory effect was Getected when testosterone comeentrutions in  ~ the treated groups were compared with these in the control groups.  INTRODUCTION           The interplay of sex hormones has been known to be associated with ascorbic acid metabolism in various animals, Testosterone - administration to castrated male albiro rats was found to restore hepatic contents of ascorbic acid metabolites to the shum control levels (Khandwekar et. al., 1974). It was suggested that the functional OH group at C-17 in androgens might have some role in  ascorbic acid metabolism, The heparin-inhibiting effect of  *Reprint requests to: Dr. Castro, Prof. of Pathology, Univ. of Miawi Schocl of Medicine, Dept.

CAMEL SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT Week of 3/12/84     1) Focus groups were conducted in Dallas, TX last week to assess consumer reaction to CAMEL's recently approved Style Awareness and Relatability advertising approaches. A total of five groups were conducted among both male and female 18-34 year old competitive smokers. Overall, consumer reaction to both advertising approaches was very positive, and both were effective in communicating their intended messages. The focus groups also generated discussion of consumers' current perceptions about CAMEL and confirmed: the need for increasing overall brand style awareness. A full report of findings from these groups will be forwarded the week of 3/19.  2) The CAMEL team Positioning Process Hypothesis Development meeting was held on 3/14 at the Graylyn Conference Center.  This meeting served as the initial stage of development for reassessment of the brand's current positioning as defined by MDD's new positioning process. As next steps, MDD will specifically investigate each hypothesis generated using available data sources, Their findings will be presented to the brand team in April, after which implication to the brand's current positioning will be assessed.

S CALCULATIONS FASED UPOH & PUBLISHED REVIEW OF AVERAGE  SECONDHAND SMOKE:  HOW MUCH ARE NON-SMOKERS  EXPOSED TO?  With all the discussion today about second- hand smoke, you may be interested in how much you are exposed to.  The answer, in our opinion, is very little. Expressing exposure to secondhand smoke in terms of cigarette equivalents is one way to gain a perspective. For example:  1} In a month, a non-smoker fiving with a smoker would, on average, be exposed to second- hand smoke equivalent to smoking approximately (vs cigarettes?  2) {na month, a non-smoking waiter who works eight hours a day, five days a week in a restaurant would, on the average, be exposed to  _ Secondhand smoke equivalent to smoking about 2 cigarettes?  3) In a month in a modern office where smok- ing was permitted, a non-smoker sharing an office with a smoker would, on average, be exposed tothe equivalent of smoking about I'4 cigaretces*  There are many ways to calculate cigarette equivalents, and no method exactly predicts the precise amount of secondhand smoke a non-  smoker is exposed to. Also, cigarette equivalent calculations are-  THE HAGNITUOE OF SECONDHAND SHORE EXPOSURE. USE       SMOKING AREA MEASUREHENTS OF NICOTINE -ONE OF SHE COMPOHENTS (OF OTHER COMPOUNDS MAY GIVE DWFFERENT ACSLATS, AND AN WIDIVIDUAL'  not necessarily relevant to an assessment of the potential risk from secondhand smoke.  In our opinion, secondhand smoke is not the same as the smoke a smoker inhales.  ‘What we are saying is that there are always two sides to every argument. Both sides need to be heard and evaluated in order to make an informed decision.  ‘We believe that the solution to most smoking issues can be found in accommodation. There are ways for smokers and non-smokers to co-exist peacefully. And we encourage discussion that will help solve the issues without resorting to Govern- ment intervention. Clearly common sense should tell everyone not to expose very young children to high levels of secondhand smoke.  As it relates to smokers, in our opinion smoking is a risk factor for certain diseases. At Rj.Reynolds we believe the choice to smoke shoutd be made only by adults.  This opinion is brought to you in the inter- ests of an informed debate by the R,].Reynolds Fobacco Company. For further information please call 1-800-366-8441.

Leonard Wood is a late addition to the VICEROY military price test, with VPR offerings beginning July 18. Previously, Ft. Knox  refused to expand the style offerings with a $1.50 VPR, so Leonard Wood is being used as a replacement. a     While it was intended that a $1.50 VPR be used at this commissary, © ne a $1.00 off coupon has been offered in conjunction with the VPR. - In order to monitor sales activities at the commissary and to ©  assess the appropriateness of continuing the test, Ft. Leonard  Wood was visited on Friday, July 29. The following observations  were made while visiting the Ft. Leonard Wood Commissary.     OBSERVATIONS  l. Sales - Approximately five cases of VKSF, two cases of ae VSL and one case of VRL 100's were sold on July 29 (a pay day). This was accomplished with a 6-carton maximum per  person. Prior to the test, average VICEROY volume was 90 cartons per week, all of it in VKSF. The sales volume on  this Friday represented a_26-fold increase over average re-promotion volume. Sales would have been Substantially higher had not the SUPPLY of RICH LIGHTS 100's been depleted  . by noon. _  VICEROY was the largest sellin brand at the commissary on July 29, selling more cartons than Marlboro or generics.  Generic sales volume averaged 5-6 cases per day before the test; since the promotion, generic sales have averaged 2-3  cases per day.     Source of Business - Based on informal observation, a majority of purchasers appeared to be former generic smokers (many of  whom were former VICEROY smokers). Other major competitive °° = sources of business were Winston, Marlboro or Pall Mall smokers.  3. Reasons For Not Purchasing - Those consumers who did not pur- . chase VICEROYS said that they generally smoked low tar or menthol cigarettes, were loyal to their own brand (particularly Marlboro, RALEIGH and Kent smokers), or were VICEROY trier- =~  rejectors.  sous __label__Memo

Physiologist  Dear Mr. vite,  Re: Your study on Passive Smceke  , New England Journal of Medicine. It ig indeed heartening that at long last scientific evicence is  -available to show the harmful effects of passive smoke on non smokers.  We have done vesearch on less harmful effects of cigarettes for the non smoker and the smoker himself for over 20 years, The results of our research have produced a number of patents which have a major effect of reducing the sidestream smoke to almost zero, thus removing the very dangers to the lungs of the non smoker. St ae  You have stated "I think the protection of human health is very important. I'm one who really detests legislation, but I wouldn't have any idea how to protect non smokers without some type of legislation", We have this answer.  Our developments in this area are based on coating the cigarette paperwith a well known, safe compound which has been documented over the years to be clear, tasteless, odorless, inert, non carcinogenic and non ellergenic, releasing only a small amount of water vapor into the smoke stream. - - - ,  The applied compound forms an insulating cover over the puraing | eoal which, in turn, slows the burning rate of the cigarette between  puffs, without interfering with the quantity, guality and taste of the puff, .  The state of California has tested our cigarette development for its properties of fire resistance, Enclosed is a copy of their report.  The Department of Hoalth, Education and Welfaro tested an earlier version of our cigarette devolopmont with test results showing about 20% less "tars", nicotine and carbon monoxide in the mainstream amoke and about 60% lesa "tars", nicotine and certain gases in tho sidostream smoke.

These bills are concerned with federal requirements for cigarette labeling and advertising and are before your Committee on Commerce for. consideration,  At its 1964 annual meeting our Association, composed of the health officer of each state and each territory of the United States, passed a recom- mendation to the effect that since cigarette smoking is a proven health hazard the state health departments and the United States Public Health Service‘need to develop comprehensive programs to help to bring under control the habit of cigarette smoking. A copy of the Association recommendation is attached.  . In view of the fact that our members unanimously agreed that scientific ‘evidence shows that cigarettes are in truth a health hazard, we would like to be-on record as supporting the type of federal legislation embodied in S. 559 or S. 547. We feel that the major health hazards for which cigarette smoking is a causative factor, such as cancer of.the lung, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, are so important today that people who smoke cigarettes, should be able to read on the -  labeling on the cigarette package the dangers to their health they are facing by continual cigarette smoking, ‘  ‘We also feel that the Federal Trade Commission needs to have its position clearly understood and Strengthened as far as labeling and advertising  is concerned, Whether this needs specific wording as to advertising asin S. 547 —  or simply leaves the Fedéral Trade Commission free to propose and undertake  such advertising control as it wishes under its existing authority is a matter about -  Which we do not feal sufficiently knowledgeable to cuminent at this time, except facsay that the opinion of the Federal ‘Prade Cominisaion Fepardiap the adverts sigs  vlawie and theit ability to administer ib should be given much weight,     TLSE H6tos __label__Letter

As first proposed about three years ago by Dr. Earl P, Benditt, of the Uni- versity of Washington. Seatue, the ides suggests that cell proiferation is first iniieted by some. chemical. biological or physical sumulys and thai the grow- ing mass is then built up into an etber- osclerotic plaque as it is invaded by fibnnogen, Gpoproteins and otber bicod components. The theory was bated on his observations thal sthero- sclerotic plaques from the sorties of three women all contained only a sin- gle form of two possible forms of tbe enryme glucose-6-phosphete debydro- genase, indicating that the atlero- sclerotic tissue must have come from only one cell population. Dr. Benditt, cheirman of the FASEB symposium, seid  August 18, 1976  Confirmed st Haphine  His work has since been confirmed by Di. Rober H.

Pre- sumebly these initistors ere carticd to smooth muscle cells in the arterial walls by blood components, stch as lisoproteins, he said.  For example, be reported laboratory evidence thet 3-rmethyl cholanthrene, B precarcinogenic mutagen found in cigarette supoke and lipoproteins from human serum ase carned in the same portion of the serum as is cholesterol.  “it bas now been observed in sev- eral laboratories that low density Lipo- proteins, among the serum proteins, are preferentially taken up by tbe smooth muscle cells derived trom bu- men and primate eniery walls wheo culivated in vitro,” Dr. Benditt said.  Evidence Forthoom'nar  "In addition, evidence is beginning to appear that there is an enzyme Sys- tem~aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase— that converts substances such as 3- methyl cholanthrene from 8 pre-muta- pen io 8 mutagen Thus we begin to see thot several of the ingredients t¢- wired for initienon of monoclonal ftowih m artery wall cclis are present yo the huaiaw system 2.

I. MULTIFACTORIAL ETIOLOGY  Because of the problem of interrelationship, certain of the  suspected factors other than smoking will be mentioned briefly. The objectives in doing so are:  (a) Yo emphasize the need for developing a perspective that will lead to the eventual evaluation of the various suspected factors as being independent, correlated, cumulative, antagonistic or synergistic agents in the  origin and/or progressive development of cardiovascular disease.  (b) To indicate possible variables in connection with which  smokers of various types and degrees may be contrasted with non-smokers or with those who have discontinued smoking for different periods of time.  Multifactorial Studies     Several multifactorial prospective studies » particularly those of the Framingham group, of the Albany group, of Stamler and of Oglesby Paul have endeavored to reach a profile description of the coronary-prone individual.  For such purposes, it has been necessary to employ available clinical definitions of the various cardiovascular conditions, in order to relate  incidence epidemiologically to constitutional and environmental factors. In  general, the lack of autopsy data has been recognized as a serious handicap to precise description and classification.  Some degree of success has been attained in reaching a profile description. Hereditary factors seem to be quite generally recognized. Epidemiologically, a rather persistent association between prevailing high serum cholesterol levels and risk of developing cardiovascular disease has been reported. High prevailing blood pressures » overweight, cigarette smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, low vital capacity, history of shortness of breath, history of peptic ulcer, history of chest discomfort, A-V nicking of the fundi, and heavy use of coffee have been reported also to show various degrees of association. Combinations of certain of these factors are associated with higher risk in some reports, but not in others.  Of course, no studies of this kind can be used alone to determine whether any one or any combination of the measured factors actually contri- butes causally to production of disease or whether they tend rather to reflect the existence of some constellation of more basic congenital predisposing characteristics which result in higher disease incidence. For example, voluntary cessation of cigarette smoking may itself reflect selective constitutional differences. The inevitable uncertainties inherent in these studies are recognized as being a severe handicap to design of effective preventive measures.  It is of interest that cigarette smoking does not appear to be associated with development of chronic angina. Since this disease is considered to be & consequence of general atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary arteries, this lack of association has been interpreted as indicating __label__Scientific

February 10, 1964  John T. McCall, Esq. Nashville Trust Building Nashville 3, Tennessee  Dear Mr. McCall: . Thank you for your letter of February 7, 1964.  «quite a few of our friends have suggested or offered to disclose lines of research which might clarify the large gaps in existing knowledge of the relation of tobacco to health.  We want you to know we appreciate the constructive approach you and your client have adopted. However, we have thought it best not ourselves to engage in the type of research your letter. contemplates. Instead, since 1954 we have supported the Tobacoo Industry Research Committee, 150 East 42nd Street, New York 17, New York, which has made grants totalling several million dollars to independent scientists engaged in a coordinated program of research into questions of tobacco use and health.

104  Dr. Rainer Wendeborn/Thomas Leutner RHONE POULENC RHODIA AG  Engesserstr. 8 7800 Freiburg  TITANI DIOXIDE I IL  SUMMARY  Worldwide consumption of TiO, in 1989 was 2.91 million tons.  The worldwide demand of TiO, for filter tow (450000 tons of tow in 1989) is about 3200 tons corresponding to 0.1 % of global consumption.  The main resources for TiO, are two types of ore: Ilmenite (FeO Ti0,) and Rutile (Ti0,). (The anatas type of T10, isa Gifferent cristalline modification which is less abrasive and  therefore preferably used in fibers). Biggest supplier of ore is Australia.  Two brands of cigarettes were equipped with two types of filters having exactly the same specification except for TiO, content: one type of filter had none, the other had 0.8 %.  Six laboratories participated and each of them analysed the smoke of the four samples for PMWNF, nicotine, CO, taste, and appearance.  The results concerning PMWNF, nicotine, CO, and taste were almost unanimous: there is no significant difference between  cigarettes using a filter with or without 40, -  Differences were found in the evaluation of the appearance.

The ition staff, Matt Myers and Cliff Oouglas, are 6 attorneys. WIth their expertise in this area:and knowledge of case precedence, we felt they could help us identify any potentia) problems with our legislation, especially Section 9 dealing with discrimination. We were hoping they could give us additional information that would help people  fee! more comfortable with that section.           Cliff and Matt offered some interesting insights thet are very important as we negotiate with the tobacco people. Unfortunately, they are not very reassuring,  They feel Section 9 has to be considered in light of the rest of the bil]. They have a number of cautions ebout the bi] which are outlined below.  1. Trey do not see the bil] as being @ private work place bill. Section 3c Cefines public place and would appear to include private work places. However, Sectien 4 states that the law “shall not apply to factories, warehouses and simitar places of work not usually frequented by the genera) Rublic,” Matt and Cliff feel a good case could be made that this law does not cover private companies, 4.6. insurance companies, lawyers’ offices, our offices, because these are not places where the public generally comes. Because of the way the b111 18 worded, the intent of the legislation is not clear. The language in Section 5 which refers to the proprietor of a private structure that includea a public place could be seen as strengthening this argument, It is their feeling that the tobacco industry would jump at the first opportunity te test this in court.  2. Section 5 permtts the establishment of a designated smoking srea and further states tnat exieting barriers can be used to minimize the intrusion of smoke into areas where it is not permitted. This creates many potential problems.  A. It establishes smoking in certain areas eas the norm. A smoker could use this language with that in Section 4 regarding places not usually frequented by the public to challenge an employers’ right to make a building totally nonsmoking or to not hire a smoker, especially if the discrimination section is left intact.  B. Another scenario ts that of the smoker who works on the edge of a smoking  section right next to the nonsmoking section in @ place of employment. If existing Garriers and ventilation are not adequate to keep smoke out of the nonsmeking section, nonsmokers would essentially be powerless. They wouldn't be able to do anything because the law allows a smoking section, the person 15 in the amoking section, barriers only have to minimize intrusion of smoke and the smoker can not be discriminated against. Conseaquentiy, the very people we are trying to protect could be left unprotected without any alternatives.  C. In Pittaburgh, the tobacco industry has mounted a massive campaign promoted as “Accommodation ~ We are fair to everyone”. Using ads, posters, stickers for doors and windows, etc., they are using the law there to encourage designated amoking areas everywhere.  TIILBC 020263  a __label__Report

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated congeners are naturally  occurring adrenal steroids in humans and represent, on a weight basis, the bulk of all steroids, other than cholesterol, found in serum. Blood levels of DHEA follow a rising-falling pattern which parallels mid-life vigor and senescent decline.  Clinical studies have shown that women who excrete subnormal levels of DHEA breakdown products in their urine are at high risk for developing breast cancer. Subsequent studies have also found that women with established breast cancer have low blood levels of both DHEA and DHEA-sulfate.  The biological role of DHEA is not known. It was demonstrated over 20 years ago that DHEA is a potent inhibitor of glucose~6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme controls a critical pathway in the metabolism of glucose which is  important in the synthesis of fat and for cell reproduction. | Anti-Obesity Action  In 1977 Yen et al. found that DHEA treatment of a genetically obese strain . of mouse prevented the development of obesity without suppressing appetite. There was no apparent toxicity, and the anti-obesity effect was reversible upon withdrawal of treatment. This may have been the first demonstration of a sub- stance which reduces weight gain without affecting appetite. The authors presented evidence that DHEA inhibited weight gain by reducing the activity of  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which resulted in an inhibition in fat  synthesis.  Anti-Carcinogenic Effect  The large body of very well documented experimental evidence showing that  reducing weight gain of laboratory mice and rats by restricting their caloric  4 __label__Report

TO:  tf Phy Ls Youd  RR  June 25, 1987  Dr. John A. Maselli  Corporate Center of Toxicology Weekly Highlights - Week Ending June 19, 1987  A review of pesticide regulations and regulatory toxicology as described in a Council” fer.Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) document was prepared by. Dr. Robert Suber. The CAST document provides a very simpl stic view of these areas without defining both the strengths and weaknesses of science  and regulations. Risk assessment as currently used by the Environmental Protection ~aAgency is only a part of the  scientific data needed to interpret risk and _ safety considerations of pesticides. The CAST document had been prepared to explain technical aspects and to provide general background information on pesticides following the recent National Academy of Science report on pesticides and risks.  The minutes of the quarterly Center meeting was distributed. The most recent developments of Proposition 65 in California  were discussed. A court -»pinion requires the California Governor to list over 200 compounds which are considered animal or human carcinogens/teratogens. The recent National Academy of Science report on pesticides was also reviewed. The report provides a theoretical approach to oncogenic risks due to pesticides and suggests that EPA review/require additional data on selected pesticides. The National Toxicology Program is preparing to test limonene and black pepper in bioassays. Del Monte is currently evaluating the use of lower sulfite concentrations on dried fruit.  - Wallace Hayes     OSOy 2290S     eee - __label__Letter

January 17, 1979  Mr. J. D. Barnhill:  Weekly Highlights Division 784  1) NWA Filter  A new smaller size garniture has been ordered and is being air freighted from England. Arrival is expected the week of January 22. Evaluation of filters produced with the garniture will begin as soon as possible,  2) HY Tow  The SALEM KS product with HY tow selected for NFO testing was rejected due to low firmness results. Another sample is being taken and will be NFO tested. Mailout will be delayed to the first of February.  3). Monsanto Filter  The equipment is being set up and sample filters will be made the week  of January 22 for RJRTI testing. Application to cigarettes in Brazil is planned. ‘  4) WINSTON Lights, SALEM Lights, and CAMEL Lights Box Products  Prototypes with correct tar and nicotine values have been prepared. Repeat  tests to obtain enough product for panel evaluations and more extensive physical and chemical analyses are underway. The work is currently on schedule or slightly ahead of schedule.  5) Multidraft Unit  The instrument was moved to 97-1 and made operational for use in monitoring VANTAGE 9 production. Initial results using afr dilution percent measured by the unit to predict tar and nicotine on production product were good. This has been done more or less as a "shake-down" exercise. We will attempt to have the unit available for the CAMEL Light 100 startup on January 29. ,       981Z ELnos __label__Letter

nwon NIEROEATOe fe  AmBmMReEE ONLY  To: Cindi C. Davis N From: Anita B Phillips  Re: Toplines of Menthol Date: July 18, 1988 Migration Study: Interleaved vs. Direct Application  Backqround/Purpose:  The Menthol Developmental Group is exploring the direct application of menthol onto the carbon sheet as an alternative to the current interleaving process (1). The level of menthol migration to the fuel source is one of the criteria  by which this decision will be made.  The Shelf Life Group assisted by evaluating and comparing menthol migra- tion to the fuel sources of products incorporating the Interleaving vs. -the ~  direct Application processes.  Procedure:  Cartons of Menthol Alpha products 8Q40A (Interleaved) and 804Q0B (Direct) were exposed to 75 F and 120 F conditions for five days. Menthol determinations of all components were made at 0, 1, 3, and S days. An informal sensory test  was performed at Qay S.  Results and Discussion:  As shown in Attachment I., results from this study suggested menthol migration to the fuel source is greater for products incorporating the interleaving vs. direct application processes when these products are exposed to either 75 F  75 F or 120 F conditions.  However, it is known that the base sheet used to make 80490 had a lewer carbon activity than the sheet used to make earlier successful prototypes, 8002C and 80128. In order to achieve a similar menthol load as the tobacco paper plug  ‘plug used in these prototypes, 4 days of interleaving were required (vs. 2 days) for 840A... This resulted in excessive free menthol which would be  available for migration and possibly bias the results of this test of direct vs. interleaving processes. Therefore, this study will be repeated with the correct carbon activity base sheet.  Next Steps:  This study will be repeated w/o 7-18-88 using products containing tobacco paper plugs with -!7% Carbon (with an activity 4.4 gms./ sq. metendn”  “  The ‘previous: plan outlined in-Carpenter, Menthol Development Activities, I0OM, June 10, vas , will be followed.

Yr  baka  POST -KEYES+:-GARDNER INC  r ¢ ADVERTISING     January 15, 1975  MR. HUGH BROOKS  RE: PETERSON PUBLISHING  Dear Hugh:  As you know, Peterson Publishing has come to us with a proposal regarding back covers in Motor Trend.  We withdrew from Motor Trend about a month ago. The reason for BROWN & WILLIAMSON's withdrawal from Motor Trend was that the corporation had no back cover franchises. Related to our not having back cover franchises, we felt that the publication's back-up policy of requiring only one inside page for each back cover may be to the detriment of BROWN & WILLIAMSON.  Motor Trend is the most efficient measured magazine for both KOOL and VICEROY. If it were not for our dispute with the pub- lication regarding back cover positions for B&W, we certainly would not have withdrawn from the publication.  The publication has offered us one back cover in 1974 (July is- sue). In addition, they have offered first option on another back cover. The Representative (Mr. Dick Opfer) also has indica- ted that he will try to secure more back covers. The July back cover would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers.  At the time we exercise the option on the additional back cover, it would be in trade for one of our existing inside covers. Un-=- til we exercise that option, we do not have to give up the inside covers.     _ a  Although this offer from Motor Trend does not address itself to the publication's back-up policy, Mr. Opfer has indicated that  the back-up policy is due for further examination by Peterson management. However, he feels it is quite unlikely that a change in the back-up policy would be implemented in the very near future.  The net result of the various meetings with Peterson is that BROWN & WILLIAMSON has gained one back cover franchise and a first option on another back cover franchise. We believe it is reasonable to seek a little more.  €9PST0099  XAY RECYCLED CZ, CESPAPER     660015463 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Letter

ADVERTISINC     Philip Morris Plans an Attack’: OnEPA A Report  By EBEN SHAPIRO Staff Reporter of Tuk WALL STRERT JOURNAL The new management team at Philip Morris Cos. is going on the attack. . The company’s two top executives told Wall Street analysts in New York last night’  . that Philip Morris plans to unleash:a-  barrage of newspaper advertisements crit- ical of media coverage of the secondhand  . Smoke issue. The advertisements repro- .  duce parts of an article from Forbes*  -»MediaCritic magazine attacking medja  coverage of the possible hazards posed By - secondhand smoke. They will run asa series over five days next week in major newspapers, including the New York.  Times, the Washington Post and The Wall -  Street Journal. The advertisements end with the slogan “In any controversy, facts _ must matter.” a  The nation’s largest tobacco company has several reasons for the counterattacks. Competitors have privately criticized the company for sitting out much of this year’s frenzied debate on tobacco. Now its new chairman, R. William Murray, and presi  dent and chief executive officer, Geoffrey |  C. Bible, are eager to confirm Wall Street and employee expectations that they will be feistier combatants than their predeces- sor, Michael A. Miles, who resigned last week. Mr. Miles, a veteran of the food industry, was never comfortable jumping into the tobacco fray.  At a briefing with Mr. Murray and Mr. Bible on Tuesday, top managers at the company’s Miller Brewing unit asked several questions about how the company planned to fight back more effectively.  The advertisements also continue an industry assault on a government report that has had a major impact on the indus- try. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which is running an extensive series of ads stress- ing ‘‘accommodation’’ on smoking issues, has already taken aim at the secondhand smoke report.  THE WALL STREET J ve FRIDAY, JUNE 24, 1904, Bt  Hundreds of municipalities and corpo- rations have implemented harsh restric- tions on smoking based on a 1993 Environ: ment Protection Agency report claiming that secondhand smoke was responsible for about 3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year.. The industry has filed suit against the EPA, seeking: to have the report with:. drawn, accusing the agency of ‘faulty. science.”  RJR has since expanded its campaign beyond secondhand smoke and recently ran an advertisement headlined “Today It’s Cigarettes. Tomorrow?” suggesting that bans on caffeine, alcohol and ham- burgers might be next.  Philip. Morris executives said addi- tional advertising beyond next week’s series of ads is likely but declined to be more specific. Despite the barrage of at- tacks on the industry, Philip Morris pre- viously ran issue advertising sparingly.  Inside the company, the more aggres- sive posture is seen as coming from Mr, Bible, the veteran tobacco executive who is known for responding swiftly to attacks, be it on the political front or from price-cut- ting rivals.  At the same meeting with Wall Street  analysts, Mr. Bible also projected higher: -  than-expected profit for Philip Morris this year. Mr. Bible said Philip Morris's earn- ings for the year would be close to 1992 levels, when the company earned $5.45 a  . share, according to analysts at the meet: ing. The consensus estimate had been .  about $5.35 a share. The company didn’t  return calls seeking comment. Gary Black, an analyst with Sanford c  Bernstein, said the new management is _ ‘determined to prove that the domestic  tobacco business remains highly profit-  "able. “They are going to pick the highest  number on the street and beat it,” Mr;  Black said. But shareholders at the meeting were  less bullish. Bruce Gregory, a portfolio manager for Progressive Partners, a large  Please Turn to Page B8, Column 4  »  SOELLOLSOZ  .»*» __label__News

oo’ DRAFT  February 26, 1979  Dade Voters for Free Choice.  2138 Biscayne Boulevard Suite 201  Miami, Florida 33137  » Ine.  We have completed our preliminary review of the economic impact of implementing the proposed "Clean Indoor Air" ordinance in Dade County, Florida. The Purpose of this review was to identify areas of impact, roughly estimate magnitudes of these impacts and to develop study approaches for a more detailed estimate in areas where impact appears  Significant. This letter summarizes the results of this preliminary review.  Work done  In performing this review we have studied the proposed ordinance, analyzed a similar impact Study made for the State of California in connection with the proposed "Proposition 5", compiled data for Dade County about the number of facilities and employees in different categories which could be impacted, performed some small surveys in order to evaluate assumptions which had been made in connection with the California survey, and computed an impact using cost factors which were developed as a part of  the California study adjusted for the results of our local surveys and interviews.  Problems encountered  Based upon our review we believe that there will be a near term cost impact in Dade County in both the Public and  Private Sectors. In attempting to quantify this impact we encountered the following difficulties:  GGZ2.2.V0089  680047755 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Letter

PI: Geoffrey L. Greene  TITLE: Identification And Characterization of Genes that Differentially Regulate Proliferation in Response to Estrogen Agonists and Antagonists  Abstract:  The overall goal of this investigation is to elucidate the molecular mechamisms by which estrogens and estrogen antagonists differentially regulate gene expression and proliferation in hormone dependent tissues and cancers. To address this problem, the hormone responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line will be used to identify differential changes in gene expression that occur in response to acute treatment with estrogens and estrogen antagonists. Identified genes will be sequenced and characterized in estrogen-sensitive and insensitive breast cancer cell lines and in two vascular cell lines.  Specific_Aims  1. To identify specific mRNA species from MCF-7K1 breast cancer cells whose expression is differentially modulated by estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-T, a partial hormone antagonist), or ICI 182,780 (ICI, a complete hormone antagonist). Total cellular RNA will be obtained from MCF-7K1 cells cultured in the presence or absence of thesc ligands and analyzed by the technique of differential RNA display. This technique permits rapid visualization and comparison of gene expression in target cells following acute treatment with estrogen agonists and antagonists.  2. To clone, identify, and characterize target genes visualized by the differential display technique. An MCF-7K1 cDNA library will be generated and used to isolate cDNA clones of the differentially regulated genes. Individual clones will be chosen for further study. If novel genes are identified, the DNA sequence and temporal expression of selected candidates in response to agonist vs. antagonists will be determined. If known genes are identified, the mechanism of regulation by estrogen receptor and hormone agonist and antagonists will be addressed in several breast cancer cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells of variable sensitivity to estrogens.  Preliminary Studies and Results  RNA differential display was performed according to the method of Liang and Pardee (1, 2). Briefly, total cellular RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells cultured in the presence of 50 ug/ml cycloheximide (CHX) or 50 ng/ml TNF-a +/- 10 nM E2, 100 nM OH-T, or 100 nM ICL RNA differential display identified six putative target genes and two of these were chosen for further characterization. The first gene was identified as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1).  Expression of MCP-1 mRNA by MCF-7 Cells  Unstimulated MCF-7 human breast cancer cells do not express detectable levels of MCP-1 mRNA when measured by Northern blot or ribonuclease protection assay. Treatment with either CHX or TNF-a, a known inducer of MCP-1 expression, for 0.5-2 hours resulted in a significant increase in steady state levels of MCP-1 mRNA. Co-stimulation of cells with CHX or TNF-a and 10 nM E2 suppressed steady state levels of MCP-1 mRNA. Under these conditions, E2-mediated suppression of MCP-1 mRNA was maximal by 1-4 hours (70% suppression). Two additional estrogens, estriol and DES, also mediated suppression of MCP-1 mRNA levels whereas the synthetic progesterone receptor agonist, ORG 2058, had no effect. Incubation of the cells with OH-T did not suppress MCP-1 mRNA accumulation and co-administration of 10 nM E2 and 2 uM OH-T or ICT abrogated the suppressive E2 effect. OH-T and ICI function as antagonisis of E2 action in the breast. Treatment of cells with actinomycin D did not alter the mRNA stability profile, which suggests that ER modulates MCP-1 mRNA expression at the transcriptional level. A synergistic down regulation of ER mRNA by TNF-a and E2 was also observed.  Expression of MCP-1 mRNA in Other Cell Lines __label__Scientific

Seligman Date: October 12, 1972  Marketing Research Department J. GRANVILLE  HTI Test Of Two Virginia Slims Packages: Box Vs. Current Soft Pack (Project No. 8718/8719)  .  The purpose of this test was to determine the degree of consumer interest in a box version of Virginia Slims relative to the current soft pack. To this end five packs each of experimental Virginia Slims Box and produc-  tion Virginia Slims Soft Pack were mailed to 325 women (125 were Virginia Slims smokers, and 200 were smokers of "other'' 100mm non-menthol filters). About two weeks after receiving their cigarettes, each woman was contacted via telephone and interviewed with regard to her: 1) overall preference,  2} package preference, and 3) whether or not she noted any differences between the cigarettes themselves.  It should be kept in mind that the Virginia Slims cigarettes used in both packages were identical with regard to all qualitative characteristics  except overall cigarette length (the cigarettes in the experimental box were about 2mm shorter).     SUMMARY /DISCUSSION  Overall preference was about equal between the Virginia Slims  in the soft pack and those in the box (49/51 for Virginia Slims smokers and 54/46 for smokers of "other'’ 100mm non-menthols).  The reasons for overall preference were based mainly on perceived differences between the cigarettes rather than package differences.  The majority of women who gave a packaging reason for their over~ all choice. voted in favor of the box.  When questioned directly as to their preferences between the  | i packages, the women indicated that the box was preferred over the soft pack (70/30 by Virginia Slims smokers and 61/39 by cross-section smokers). It was also found that each type of package possessed its own, unique attributes: Box: "Cigarettes didn't crush/Box protected them,'' "No logse tobacco/Neat/Not Messy "' "Cigarettes didn't fall out," ‘Reeps cigarettes fresh/moist/not dry." {  Soft Pack: "Fits better into pocket or purse, ' "Fits better Tnto cigarette case" "Smaller/Not Buiky."  Finally, when asked about the differences between the cigarettes themselves, the women in both smoker groups tended to believe  that those cigarettes in the soft pack were "milder/less harsh" than those in the box.  Generally, we conclude that box packaging is preferred to the soft paper pack by a majority of women 100mm smokers. However, this preference is a 'weak'" one, in that it had little impact on overall preference. Also it appears that cigarettes packed  in the traditional soft paper package are perceived as being "“milder/less harsh" than those packaged in the hard box.     p6Loorlvo0c __label__Memo

CHARGE NUMBER: 6906  PROGRAM TITLE: BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SMOKE PERIOD COVERED: JANUARY I-31, 1984  PROJECT LEADER: C. K. ELLIS  DATE OF REPORT: FEBRUARY 2, 1984  WRITTEN BY: B. D. DAVIES  I. SALMONELLA/MICROSOME (S/M) MUTATION ASSAY -- MAINSTREAM AND  A S/M experiment was conducted to compare 2R1l sidestream (SS), base fraction (BF), and neutral fraction (NF) from a small scale smoking (2) (30 cigerettes smoked one at a time) to that of a large scale smoking (3) (120 cigerettes smoked 30 at a time). In TA98, results obtained for the small scale smoking compared well with data from the large scale smoking and with previous results using these same samples. Analysis of the data indicated that the bulk of the activity resides in the BF with minimal activity in NF. Data from TA100 also compared favorably with previous. data and between small and large scalie smokings. While analysis of the TA100 data indicated no difference in $S CSC, BF and NF activities, the NF from the large scale smoking appeared more active than that obtained from the small scale smoking.  The collaborative study to evaluate MS and SS CSCs, BFs, and NFs. from five cigarette types was completed. To follow up these studies, an experiment was perfonmed to examine the relationship of duplicate SS CsCs, BFs, and NFs from alll five cigarette codes simultaneously. Examination of the data revealed a close agree- ment with the previously reported data in that the BFs appeared more active than CSCs while NFs possessed little activity. Plans call for TA100 to be similarly tested.  Il. S/M MS/SS ACTIVITY DETERMINATION -- SUBFRACTIONS OF .  . 9001402452 Currently, a study to determine MS/SS a€tivity of subfrac-  tions. of neutrals from model cigarettes is in progress. Duplicate sample preparations are being tested in TA1OQ +/~ S9. The ulti- mate subfraction being utilized is the PAH III fraction with its associated strip. The objectives of these studies are twofold, First, to compare MS or SS activities of subfractions isolated from neutrals and secondly to compare these activities on a model by model basis. To date, the activities of 2R1, S8ENF, and D3IM models have been obtained with only RCB and RL models remaining to be tested. : __label__Scientific

From: The Second Surgical Clinic of the University of Vienna Director: Professor Dr. W, Denk, Beitrage zur Klinischen chirurgie, Munich, 186:259-384, Nove 3, 1953.  REMARKS ON BRONCHIAL CARCINOMA  by W, Denk  ‘  During the last years there have been many papers on lung cancer, It is therefore, unnecessary to review here consequently this very timely disease, In the following, we shall discuss a few aspects of the total problem and report a few observations which we have been able to make with the many patients of our Clinic.  There seems to be no question that the absolute number of bronchial cercinomata has increased, This can be further proved by a few figures, ,  Gesell reports from Switzerland that the totel mortality from cancer has almost doubled (1.8:1) from 1904 to 1948, while the mortality from lung cancer has ine creased in the same period 20,7 times, In the United States in 1920, 1.1% of all deaths due to cancer were due to a bronchial carcinoma, while in 1948 the  figure was already 8.3%,  The figures for the population of the city of Vienna have been put at our dis- posal by the Central Statistical Office of the city, Total deaths due to cancer have increased from 1931 to 1938 (21 city districts) 15.3%, and from 1939 to 1951 (26 city districts), they have increased by 16.7%, The deaths from carcinoma of the respiratory system in men were 15.8% of all cancer deaths in 1931, 20.6% in 1938, and 31.76% in 1951,  For men and women together, the percentage of deaths from cancer of the respira- tory system as a percentage of the total mortality from cancer was 6.66% in 1931, 11.92% in 1938, and 17,94 in 1951, The total mortality of the population of the City of Vienna due to cancer has increased by one sixth during the last twenty years; the mortality from cancer of the respiratory system has doubled,  In 1934, 440 people died per each 100,000 inhabitants of the City of Vienna due to cancer of the respiratory system; for 1939, the figure wis 584, and for. 1951, 1,014. These figures likewise prove that there was a mch greater increase in deaths due to lung cancer when referred to the total mortality due t. cancer.  These conclusions, however, are somewhat limited by the fact that the mortality statistics do not give’as clear a picture as a morbidity statistic, which does not exist in Austria, It is certain that presently a greater number of other carcinomata than those of the lung are cured, and those naturally are not in- cluded in a mortality statistic for cancer. This arguement against the mortality statistics nevertheless, does not alter the fact of the absolute increase. How- ever, we shall not discuss these theories in detail, Here we shall discuss only the effects of cigarette smoking on bronchial carcinoma, since these relations are ar great timeliness. We shall discuss this on the basis of patients in our Clinic,     : LOLI 9BLOS __label__Report
REAL-TIME FAST EVOLVED GAS ANALYSIS BY FTLR METHOD: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF CELLULOSE PYROLYSIS  8. Li, J. Lyons-Hart, J. Banyasz and K. Shafer Research, Development, and Engineering Philip Morris U.S.A  P.O. Box 26583  Richmond, VA 23261  USA  Abstract  A two heating zone pyrolysis system capable of a heating rate of 40 °C/second and a flow rate of 70 ml/second was coupled to a rapid scanning Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). This fast cvolved gas analysis system was applicd to the study of the simultaneous evolution of low molecular weight gas phase products, such as CO, CO», H20, CHa, CoHa, and CHO during the pyrolysis of ccllulosc. Different pyrolytic conditions, including heating rate, gas flow rate, and residence time, were tested to study their effects on the formation of gaseous compounds during cellulose pyrolysis. Efforts were made to achieve a well- controlled heating environment and sample temperature measurement, Levoglucosan, a major component of tar and a primary pyrolysis product, was also studied. Comparison of the pyrolysis products from cellulose and levoglucosan showed great similaritics and provided insights into the precursors and formation mechanisms of gas phase products. This experimental method provides not only a technique to analyze evolved gases in real time, but information on reaction  mechanisms as well as a way to distinguish and control primary and secondary reactions.  2078582262 __label__Scientific
a  PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY FOR EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE 179, 288-295 (1985)  A System for Monocytic Differentiation of Leukemic Cells HL 60 by a Short Exposure to 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (42098)  GEORGE P. STUDZINSKI, AMARJIT K. BHANDAL, AND ZAMIR 5S. BRELVI Department of Pathology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103     Abstract. The human promyelocytic cell Jine HL 60 can be induced to differentiate toward more mature myeloid or monocytic forms by a variety of agents. This process is thought to require several days of exposure to the inducer, thus making it difficult to identify the early cellular changes which are fundamental to the differentiation program, and to relate the induction to phases of the cell cycle. In order to study the kinetics of leukemic cell differentiation we have developed a system for the induction of rapid monocytic maturation in a subpopulation of HL 60 cells. The cells are exposed to 10°? M 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol for 4 br in serum-free medium. Subsequent incubation in a complete medium results in cellular differen- tiation recognizable by several criteria (phagocytosis, nonspecific esterase reaction, adherence to substratum, cell morphology) beginning at [0 hr from the exposure to the inducer. Approximately 20 hr later 30-40% of the cells in culture show the differentiated phenotype and are capable of phagocytosis. The proportion of differentiated cells in culture decreases thereafter. This system has been utilized to study the expression of c-myc oncogene in relation to the kinetics of maturation, and it was found that the inhibition of the expression of this gene precedes the onset of phenotypic differentiation by approximately 8 hr, is transient, and is accompanied by a brief retardation of cell proliferation, which resumes the normal rate within 24 hr of the exposure to the inducer. © 1985 Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.  a  HL 60 cells, isolated from a patient with a promyelocytic leukemia (1), have provided a useful model for maturation of leukemic cells. In culture, these cells show a low level of spontaneous differentiation, and essentially complete conversion to terminally differen- tiated forms can be induced by a variety of chemical compounds. For instance, dimethyl sulfoxide (2) and retinoic acid (3) produce conversion in 6-10 days to predominantly granulocytic cellular forms, while phorbol esters (4), lymphocyte-conditioned medium (5), and vitamin D derivatives (6-9) induce the monocytic/macrophage pathway of dif- ferentiation after 3-7 days in culture.  The long periods of time required for the phenotypic manifestations of the inducer ac- tion suggest that a complex series of steps is necessary for the expression of the differen- tiation program, and indicate to some that the process is stochastic in nature (10, 11). However, a relationship to a specific cell eycle event cannot be ruled out in experi- mental systems which utilize periods of in- duction greater than 24 hr, since this repre- sents almost an entire generation cycle for  optimally growing HL 60 cultures. In this situation cells are successively recruited into the differentiation program as they repeatedly traverse the cell cycle in the presence of the inducer, making it impossible to relate changes in cell cycle-linked events to the maturation process.  Several studies addressed the question of the minimal length of exposure of HL 60 cells to the inducer which can result in phenotypic expression of differentiation sev- eral days later. Treatment with dimethyl sulf- oxide for 12 hr resulted in granulocytic dif- ferentiation of 20% of cells when examined 6 days later (10). Monocytic differentiation of HL 60 cells with 1,25-dihydroxycholecal- ciferol (1,25(OH)2D3;), one of the most potent inducers of differentiation, appeared to re- quire an even longer period of induction of differentiation, being variously estimated as 30 hr (11) of 18 hr (9), for a minimal expression of morphological or functional indicators of monocytic differentiation, as determined after a total of 4 (11) or 7 (9) days. These results suggested that, relative to events which occur at the molecular level,  288  0037-9727/85 $1.50  Copyright © 1985 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

NEW YORK, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1971  212 682-3576  ORGANIZED IN 1935  WHOLESALE TOBACCO DISTRIBUTORS OF NEW YORK, Inc.  © 1971 New York Pest Corporation     See New Cigaret Tax as Bootleggers' Dream  By RON HOLLONDER  If the state tax on a pack of cigarets is raised six cents, a move the Legisla- ture is considering, the city will be an even more attrac- tive ground for bootleggers.  The boost would bring the total tax in the city to 22 cents-a-pack, (plus sales tax of another three cents) as opposed to current state cigaret taxes of 14 ‘cents in New Jersey, 16 cents in  Connecticut, 13 cents in Rhode Island and 18 cents in Pennsylvania. But North  Carolina, the state from which millions of cigarets are bootleged into the city each year, would still have a tax of only two cents a pack.  This 20-cent-a-pack differ- ence is the incentive for boot-  leggers to make the journey from North Carolina to New  York, their tru ith false, backs ipg the etal cargo. toa  or their cars with abbreviated gas tanks crammed with thousands of cartons of brand-name cigarets.  The cigarets are then sold to a middle-man who in turn sells them, several cartons at a time, at plants, factories and offices.  This week, the Cigaret Tax Enforcement unit of the state's Special Investigations Bureau stopped a small de- livery van loaded with 2,316 cartons of cigaretes bearing the North Carolina tax decal but no New York tax stamp.  Alerted beforehand that the truck bearing the con- traband was heading for New York, four agents in three cars started following van as soon as it entered New York. The driver, growing suspic- ions, ran three red lights to determine whether he was being followed and tried to shake the agents:  é  Unable to "lose them, . he  suddenly parked the truck and ran. He escaped but the truck and cigarets were con- fiscated. The cigarets are worth $10,000 if sold at the legitimate market price of about $4.25 a carton. If dis- tributed illegally, they would bring about $7000. They cost about $2000 in North Caroli- na. Last year 120,000 carton of contraband cigarets were seized by the state agency, almost all of them in the city. There is no reliable of- ficial estimate of how many got through undetected.  Persons entering the state may bring with them two cartons for their own use. Above that they must pay the state’s tax, and the packs would then be marked with a stamp bearing the state seal.  In 1968, iniporting more than 100 cartons of untaxcd  , ejgarcts was made a. fclony  punishable by up to. five  c  years imprisonment. Pay- ment of the state cigaret tax is also required on cigarets bought through the mail, even if the original pur- chase price doets not in- clude the tax. A federal law requires anyone in one state mailing cigarets to persons in another state to notify that state’s tax agency of the name and address of the receiver of the cigarets. The tax agency will then send him a bill.  The Cigaret Tax Enforce- ment unit has 70 men stak- ing out various entry points into the city and inspecting cigarets being sold for the proper state stamp. Arrests have been made at La Guar- dia and Teterboro airports, where contraband has been flown in, and at but stations, where smugglers were caught on interstate buses.  Most of the cigarets come  lages along Interstate High- way 95, which the agents call “Tobacco Road.” Gas stations along this route have signs advertising cheap cigarets. Often the stations are just a front for the warehouses 1> cated Sehind them,  The smuggling business in untaxed cigarets is so prof't- able that tobacco company trucks bse Seen hijacked en route to the city, cases of cig- arets intended for South Am- erica and therefore unstamp- ed have been stolen from piers and bootleggers have even ?djacked competitors’ trucks.

f  Health Effects of Refueling Vapors: The Health Effects Institute Analysis  by  Robert Kavet, Sc.D. Senior Staff Scientist Health Effects Institute October 28, 1986  Introduction  In 1985, the Health Effects Institute published an analysis it conducted of the informational basis for quantifying cancer risks from exposure to unleaded refueling vapors, an exposure that mainly occurs while at the self-service pump. Using the National Research Council's framework for risk assessment, the HEI analysis concluded that important information was lacking in the three areas that lead to the actual quantification of risk. The three are: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, and exposure assessment.  Before proceeding further with details of the analysis, a quick word on the Health Effects Institute. HEI, a non-profit corporation, was incorporated in 1980, to "conduct or support the conduct of, and to evaluate, research and testing relating to the health effects of emissions from motor vehicles". HEI is cofunded equally by the the public and private sectors, the EPA contributing 50 percent and the manufacturers of engines or vehicles certified for use on U.S. highways contributing 50 percent. This arrangement was designed to minimize the adversarial nature of the controversy surrounding the control of auto emissions. In addition, HEI's establishment enabled the industry to honor its legal obligation to sections 202(a) and 206(a) of the Clean Air Act, which were enacted in 1977, and require that "after model year 1978, no emission control device     Z7S$06 @80TS __label__Report

Worth Airport Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX 75261  Dear Diane:  As I'm sure you are aware, there is practically no movement of H.B. Crownfilter cigarettes through your airport duty free shop. Accord- ing to our records, the last order you placed for this brand was for  1 - 10M case in April, 1982.  In view of this, we cannot justify to our associates in Germany to continue supporting H.B. with the lighted display in your duty free shop, and they have asked us to cancel it.  In accordance with the terms of our letter of agreement dated Janu- ary 23, 1981, and your letter dated December 28, 1981, in which it was agreed that displays could be cancelled on thirty (30) days no- tice, please accept this as our request to cancel the H.B. display. We will pay rental on this display through May 15, 1983, and ask that you remove it at that time.  We may be able to use the lightbox at another location at a later date, and would like to have it shipped back to this office. If you can arrange to ship it to us by U.P.S., we will be pleased to reimburse you for any packing and shipping costs. Otherwise, you can store it in your warehouse until Bob Castro next visits you and  he can arrange shipment at that time.  Many thanks for your help and cooperation.  Best regards, W.A,.

March 20, 1992  Senator Harold R. Finn State Office Building St. Paul MN 55155  Dear Senator Finn:  Solving our health care insurance problems are going to require far more difficult solutions than simply making  Minnesota’s tobacco tax the highest in the nation at the expense of Minnesota’s businesses.  If Governor Carlson’s proposal goes through, one group of businesses and consumers will bear the burden of paying for a necessary and vital program. My only question to you is this: what happens when those customers go elsewhere to buy their tobacco and the state doesn’t collect the’ amount of money it needs to finance this program? Where will the money come from next? Who is going to make the decision on who gets coverage and who doesn’t when the money runs out?  Customers of Minnesota businesses and most importantly their employees should not be the ones who have to pay the price because Governor Carlson and some legislators think raising tobacco taxes solves the problem of affordable and  accessible health care. We don’t need gimmicks; we need leadership.  Sincerely,  arte. Caw Orda,  Darla Edwards RT 2 Box 274 Nevis, MN 56467  TIMN 458860 __label__Letter

(B&W: PROTECTED BY MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION PROTECTIVE ORDER  “ BROWN & WELLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT  FILE NOTE  SUBJECT: PAPER RECON FROM MARLBORO KS AND MARLBORO MENTHOL LIGHTS 100'S/451  AUTHOR: E. D. Alford P DATE: November 20, 1987  cc; M. L. Reynolds, T. F. Riehl, C. N. Kounnas, A. MeMurtrie, D. V. Cantrell, J. o. Lauterbach,-J. F. Nall, W. H. Deines, R. R. Johnson, E. F. Litzinger, D. A. Colby, W. R. Conway, R. A, Marshall  ATION  SUMMARY  ‘The paper recons from Marlboro KS and Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s were found to be different. The paper recon from Marlboro KS contained DAP and therefore exhibited the sugar-ammonia products. The Marlboro Menthol Lights 100's paper recon did not contain phosphate in excess of the level typically found in PJS where no DAP was added. Therefore, the levels of the sugar-asmonia Progucts were much lower (80-852) in the paper recon from Marlboro Menthol Lights 100‘s.  2 ~ Y < = S        Tt has not been proven, but the furnish for the two paper recon are also thought to be different. The furnish for the paper recon found in Marlboro KS was thought to be heavily skewed towarg burley while, the furnish for the Marlboro Menthol Lights 100’s was thought to be skewed toward Elue-cured furnish.  A comparison of the paper and dark recons from Marlboro KU were also made. This comparison showed that paper recon exhibited most of the sugar-amponia reaction products found in the dark recon and in about the eame quantities. The major differences were found in the wlatile alkyl pyrazines region of the P&T profiles.  ‘ONFIDENTIAL MINNESOT,  €  e > INTRODUCTION  Bob Jobnaon bad isolated the paper recon from Marlboro KS and Marlboro  Wenthol Lights 100's. These materials, along with the dark recon from 8 Marlboro KS, were examined by purge-and-trap (P&T) and direct  silylation (DS) GC-MS. The combination of both of these analyses  showed the volatiles from the alkylpyrazines to deoxyfructosazine and » fructosazines, Data from both of the analyses were used to reach the conclusions drawn in this file note.  812 76066 __label__Report
TOBACCO ACCESS LAW NEWS NUMBER 27 DECEMBER 1994  Now that states are beginning to seriously consider how to enforce their youth access laws, they need to be able to project the personnel and budgets this will require. Although I recommend that communities plan to conduct compliance checks on a quarterly basis, this recommendation is based on the limited data we have available and is really no more than an educated guess. For example, it is possible that as compliance testing becomes commonplace and corporations adopt their own policies and training programs, less  frequent testing may be adequate. It is also possible that larger fines may reduce the required frequency of testing. ,  In other words, there is much that remains unknown about how these laws can be best enforced, and there will be a critical need for this information in the very near future. While compliance testing is underway in a variety of locations, the data from this experience is not being collected and analyzed to make it helpful to others.  1 am seeking funding from the Centers for Disease Control to use the Tobacco Access Law News network to identify enforcement programs throughout the US, and to collect and analyze the data available from these programs so that effective state enforcement programs can be designed.  The grant reviewers seck more specific information about what enforcement programs are currently underway. I am therefore asking each of my US and Canadian readers who receive this wonderful newsletter free to complete the form on the last page of this newsletter and mail it back to me as soon as possible. Thank you for your help.  AUSTRALIA  NEW SOUTH WALES- The current law requires children to testify and provides a defence that the child looked old enough. Prosecutions have ben rare. Public Health Units have received a total of 327 complaints to which they responded with 271 warning letters. Due to public pressure the government hired a police prosecutor for a one year contract to do prosecutions. Still, prosecutions have been few. In response to a letter from Dr Chesterfield-Evans, Health Minister Phillips wrote that "prosecutions are not always seen as the most appropriate manner to ensure that retailers are aware of the legislation and comply with its requirements. Research has indicated that a high level of compliance is achieved through the use of alternative methods to prosecutions such as warning letters and retailer education...it is my view that prosecutions should be seen as an act of last resort." For the record, the research does not indicate what he claims it  TTT’ O6€ETS __label__Report

Lr TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  November 3, 1993  TO: L. H. Gains FROM: M. E. Viso  SUBJECT: Experimentation Using Charcoal to Remove Nitrogen Oxides from Cigarette Smoke (PROJECT B 451, CMP)  In an earlier memorandum, I outlined work using charcoal impreg- nated with 1,3-butadiene as a filter additive to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) delivery in mainstream smoke (1). This experimen- tation indicated that cigarettes containing either untreated charcoal or butadiene impregnated charcoai had lower NOx delivery than cigarettes containing no charcoal. The question arose as to whether NOx delivery could be reduced using untreated charcoal and whether NOx delivery was related to the amount of untreated charcoal used.  Experimentation has been carried out to address these issues. The results from this experimentation seem to contradict the previously obtained data that NOx delivery can be reduced using charcoal filters. No reduction in NOx delivery was seen using untreated charcoal. Additionally, no relationship was seen between the amount of untreated charcoal used and the NOx deliv- ery.  Two possible sources of this contradictory data include variabil- ity of the method used to assay NOx delivery or inhomogeneity in the nitrate content of the tobacco in the experimental ciga- rettes. Further experimentation will be performed to help Clarify the results.  EXPERIMENTAL  A carton of 1188-93 cigarettes was removed from the freezer and allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. The cigaret- tes were then weight selected and those weighing from 1.06 to 1.09 grams were retained. Calgon type PCB 12 X 30 mesh charcoal was incorporated into the cigarettes. The charcoal was added by removing the outer filter portion, placing the charcoal in the cavity, and reinserting the outer filter portion. Any part of the filter that extended beyond the tipping paper was cut off. fhe amounts of charcoal incorporated into the filters were 50, 90, 240, and 180 milligrams. Controls containing no charcoal were prepared by removing the outer filter portion in each cigarette and then reinserting it.  GLSTESES  to S fo] & Ny ay bo) © a.  sjkin __label__Memo

1)  2)  3)  MS SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES w/o 10/6/86  Brand met with Production Planning to develop a manufacturing timetable for Project MS. Production is tentatively scheduled for a 2/16/87 start-up date, with test market quantities available by 2/25 for a 3/30 DTS. These dates will be confirmed once quantity requirements per style are provided by Forecasting.  Brand met with Purchasing and Packaging Technology to discuss timing and next steps for MS packaging development/production. A timetable was developed, to be presented as part of the total MS marketing plan the week of 10/13. As current status,  pack and carton comps have been reviewed by Management and minor revisions requested to improve the readability of the medalion logo and to use the conventional spelling of "lights" rather than "lites" on the FFLT style. Revised designs are expected this week.  Long, Haymes and Carr presented to the Brand revised creative for several alternative MS advertising campaigns which currently are under consideration for the April 1987 test market. The Agency also provided additional price and quality descriptors which were developed under the objective of succinctly communicating MS' dual benefits of virile/young adult user imagery and generic price. Brand selected several visuals  for development into color comps to be presented to R. A. Kampe this week. Creative and alternative copy lines will then be taken to focus groups the week of 10/27.  6468 2250S __label__Report

Collins, Ph.D. Professor of Pharmacology Institute for Behavioral Genetics University of Colorado at Boulder Campus Box 447 Boulder, CO 80309  Dear Al,  We are looking forward to the upcoming 1992 RJRT Conference on Sponsored Nicotine Research and hope that you are, as well. This letter is to inform you of the latest developments regarding the Conference and to solicit additional information from you that will help us do the best job that we can.  Your usual contact should already have discussed travel expenses with you. Please make sure that you have a clear understanding on this point, to save difficulty later.  Because we expect that proprietary information may be discussed during the sessions, or in private conversations outside the plenary sessions, we will, as usual, ask you to sign a confidentiality agreement covering the Conference on the first day.  If you have any special equipment needs such as videocassette players, movie projectors, overhead or slide projectors, and so on, or suggestions for set-up, please let us know exactly what your needs are as soon as possible.  Lunches, and light breakfast snacks will be served here at our facility each day. There will also be a dinner on the evening of Thursday, May 21st at the Stouffer Winston Plaza Hotel. Other meals will be at your discretion.  Hotel reservations have been made for you at the Stouffer Winston Plaza Hotel. If you have changes in your current schedule, please let us know.  We have arranged transportation with the Blue Bird Cab Company to and from Conference venues and the hotel. Transportation arrangements from Winston- Salem to the airport on your departure can be made, however, you will have to let us know your confirmed return flight schedule. You should plan to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel yourself.  Enclosed with this letter is the Conference schedule.  ‘“‘We work for smokers.’  f9CG 66LOG __label__Letter

Christopher, Jr.  SUBJECT: Low/No Nicotine Projects  I, LN-50 NOW LN 100 Prototypes  Test products have been released for an upcoming Product/Concept test of NOW 100 prototypes for the NOW low nicotine project. The objective of this development pathway has been to reduce the smoke nicotine yield versus the current nicotine yield by a minimum of 50%. The objective has been met with both prototypes which were produced for this consumer testing. Prototype #1 utilizes a blend composed solely of low nicotine off-shore tobacco. This product achieves a smoke nicotine reduction of just over 50%. Prototype #2 uses the same base blend except that the Part II burley and flue-cured was denicotinized on the FS-2001 pilot line with a double pass to simulate a single pass through #605. This product achieves a 63% reduction in smoke nicotine. Mailout of the test products occurred the week of 4/17; results are due 6/5. A Fourth Quarter 1989 test market introduction is planned.  VANTAGE LN 85 Prototypes  The objective of the VANTAGE LN program is to design products which deliver  50% less nicotine than conventional FFLT cigarettes. Two of the developed prototypes are variations of the VANTAGE 100 blend, while the third prototype is a modified WINSTON Lights/CAMEL Lights blend. All prototypes feature low  nicotine tobaccos and white tipping in an 85 mm configuration. Test results are  1  zoze 90L0S __label__Letter

be  i 4  a  @ BOOK IT  Buist - U. of Oregon ~ #1044  The role of alpha, antitrypsin deficiency as a risk factor in the development of chronic airways obstruction.  The investigator's specific aim is to examine the role of alpha antitrypsin (a, AT) deficiency as a risk factor in the development of  chronic airway obstruction. The hypotheses to be tested are that  a) MZ heterozygote for a,AT deficiency has impaired lung function as measured by a wide range of tests of lung mechanics and  b) the MZ heterozygote does not belong to the high risk category for the development of chronic airway obstruction unless there is an  additive factor such as smoking, pollutants etc.  In view of the unusual population available and her expertise, I recommend continuation at high priority.

Ay oe oa, ie.  EFFECT OF NATURAL VITAMINS AND A CITRUS EXTRACT ON IN VITRO AND IN VIVO LIPID PEROXIDATION  JOE A. VINSON* and CHI HSU DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY UNIVERSITY OF SCRANTON  SCRANTON, PA 18510 U.S.A.  in vitro lipid peroxidation of red blood cells has been studied using high glucose (55.5 mM) in the media to stimulate lipid peroxidation. Vitamins A, C and E in a natural matrix and a citrus extract reduced lipid peroxidation as measured by thiobarbituric acid reactivity. A human supplementation study was done in which it was shown that natural vitamin Cc containing ascorbic acid and citrus extract significantly elevated lipid peroxidation in both plasma and urine. Citrus extract alone decreased plasma lipid peroxidation. Natural vitamin A and E decreased both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation. A  combination of natural vitamins A, E and citrus extract was the  most effective supplement resulting in more than a 30% decrease in both plasma and urine lipid peroxidation.  Key words: lipid peroxidation, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, citrus extract, thiobarbituric acid INTRODUCTION  Oxygen, though necessary for life, is a toxic substance. Fortunately, 98% of the oxygen is completely reduced to water in the process of respiration. The other 2% turns into potentially toxic free radical oxidants?. ‘These substances can damage proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. They can also directly reduce the level of the antioxidant defense molecules in the plasma, Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation has been implicated in several disease states including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, postischemic  reoxygenation injury, as well as in the degenerative processes  *ro whom inquiries should be addressed.  50579881 __label__Scientific
Philip Morris U.S.A. Inter-office Memorandum     TO: Liz Chambers Sept. 9, 1997 FROM: __ Richard Jupe (Qj SUBJECT: Salem Pianissimo - Japan  At your request, the following information has been compiled in reference to the filter systems used for the Salem Pianissimo 100’s (2 mg) and Salem Pianissimo Lights 100’s (6 mg) products produced by RJ Reynolds for the Japanese market. Although the product claims low side stream, there is nothing too unique concerning the filter systems for either of these products.  As the attached PTL data indicate, the filters for both products are conventional mono-acetate plugs. Both - products use one row of Hauni on-line ventilation (20 holes per row) to achieve the ventilation levels for the products. The measured ventilation levels used to achieve the tar values, are comparable to the levels  used by numerous products to meet those tar deliveries. It would appear that the high level of ventilation and the level of expanded tobacco are the mechanisms used to acquire a low tar delivery for the 2 mg product.  cc: Barbro Goodman  OS2691L¢z02  Philip Morris USA Confidential PO622 __label__Memo

Recent work by an inter. nationally known epidemiolo- nist suggests that “ detection  , bias" in a variety of studies  | may. just possibly have pro-  'ducy a “falsely high  ‘ass... .iion” between smok- ing ana lung cancer.  Dr Alvin R. Feinstein, Pro-  fessor of Medicine and Epi- cemiology at Yale University, suys that if his findings of such “bias” in a study of more than 1,300 lung cancer patients are confirmed for the seneral population of smok- ers and nonsmokers, “we may have to reappraise some _of the statistical rezscning that has hitherto been used to form causal conclusicns " about smoking as a carcino cen,  The findings were based on a retrospective restudy of data on all patients (1,331) with a diagnosis of primary ‘uag cancer at Yale-New Haven Hospital and West Haven Veterans Administra- ven Hospital during 1953- WeG4,  The first clue to the exist- cnce of a possihly unrecog- nsed bias came with a “ necropsy surprise". Of 654 Patients examined post mor- tum lang cancer had been uns cted beforehand in 12, ue 16 per cent.  Further study showed that “nondiagnosis during life " was highest among those matlents (37 per cent) whose     Medical News Reporter  history of cigarette smoking was unknown.  “The rate of nordiagnosis,” Dr. Feinstein said, “had a dis- tinctive downward gradient, going from 37 per cent unde- tected among the non-cigar- ette smokers to 20 per cent among the light smokers; 14  rcentin the moderate; and 0 and 12 per cent in the heavy and extreme smckers.  “There was a similar gra- dient, but with Jarcer denomi- hators, for the rate of non- diagnosis in the entire case sores, rather than in the nec- ropsy group alonc.  “The cata therefore sug- gested that the more paticnis snwked, the more likely they were to have lung cancer de- tected during life.”  He and his colleague, Dr.’  Carolyn K.

But within each category of cough the “search rates went up in relation to the amount of smoking.”  Among patients with no cough the search rate rose from 46 per cent in the no- smoking troup to 59 per cent among light or moderate smo- kers and to 64 per cent in the  heavy or extreme smoking group.  Among patients with chro- nic cough there was an “analgous gradient,” Dr. Fein- stein reports, ranging from 53 to 81 to 85 per cent. In patients with a recent cough, the search rate went from 64 to 80 to 84 per cent in the respective groups.  The Pap smear search rate, he added, was lower in pa- tients with disseminated can- cer than in those with distant metastases, “but in both Clinical stayes, the gradient of search increased with higher amounts of smoking.”  In a Metical News inter- view, Dr. Feinstein acknow- ledged that he was question- ing “one of the icons” of modern statistics; but he Stressed that the operative word was “ * questioning,’ not *atlacking’."" “The data we have are suitable for rsising questions, not for launching an attack,” he said.     jo ¢, “ s - ¢ , < 2 a z 1 oO N S. __label__News

Dear ky, Hoyt:  Recent publicity in the press about the "findings" by researchers  on the subject of cigarette smoking and lung cancer created & scare which may have some effect on cigarette sales. And if the researchers oress their claims further I believe that cigarette sales will va affected a great deal with monetary losses to the tobacco industry.  I firmly believe that should the researchers prove beyond doubt that excess cigarette smoking causes lung cancer the tobacco industry would openly warn the public of such a danger, Conversely, af the deaders Digest, for inatance, learned that there is no ’ danger of lung cancer in cigarette smoking, even excessively, they would retract their “hostility” toward smoking, and even may come to the support of the cigaratte induetry.  T have been studying this problem for some time and I have discovered a "solution" to your problem, (to allay scare of smoking tobacco).  I would like to present my solution to the vroper "agency". Naturally I would like to be compensated for this service. If your organization is the proper "agency" to negotiate such a proposition please let  me know and I will submit it to you. Cf course, if my "aolution"  1S not acceptable you are not obligated to pay me anything.  if your organization is not the proper "agency" to negotiate such  & proposition (authorized to pay for sarvices) would you be kind anoush to let me know of their name and address?

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: . Mr. Dick Heretick Date: January 22, 1988 From: . Myron Johnston - Subject: . Differences between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights  As Peggy Martin noted in her memo on this subject, the major difference  between smokers of Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights is their age. Most of the socio-economic differences observed are what one would expect on the basis of the different age distributions. As she also mentioned, the National POL Panel, on which those data are based, is short of young smokers and blacks, because of the difficulty in recruiting them and keeping them on the panel, and is heavily weighted with women. (When we select panelists for a product test we select based on the true distribution of smokers of the brand of interest, as you know.) Because the Panel is not truly representative of the market, I looked at the data from the Tracking Study.  Percent who smoke Marlboro Lights and Winston Lights, by age  The top panel of Figure 1 shows the percent of all smokers who smoke a Marlboro Light or Winston Light (King or 100), by age. Winston Lights Kings has its highest market penetration among smokers 35 to 44 years old and Winston Lights 100s, like 100mm brands generally, skews toward an older group. By contrast, Marlboro Lights Kings has its greatest appeal to the youngest smokers. As in the case of Winston, the 100mm version skews toward somewhat older ages then the King, but unlike Winston Lights 100s, Marlboro Lights 100 still has its highest market penetration among the youngest smokers.  The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the percent of smokers who smoke the different packings of Marlboro Lights, by age. In both cases the box packings skew more toward young smokers than the soft packs. This is true of virtually every brand that is available in both box and soft pack.  Historical patterns of smoking of Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights  Marlboro Lights has not always skewed so heavily to the young smokers. Until the early 1980s the growth of Marlboro Lights was iargely a result of people switching out of Marlboro Red, and its smokers were not as young as smokers of Marlboro Red. Since then it has become increasingly an entry brand. Figure 2 shows the percent of smokers, by age, who smoked Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights (Kings or 100s) for the years 1979 to 1987.  Note that after several years during which both Marlboro Red and Marlboro Lights increased share among the 18-21 year-old smokers, Marlboro Red declined from 1986 to 1987, This, I think, is less cause for worry than might appear at first glance. Between 1979 and 1982 the Marlboro Lights share of 18-21 year- old smokers increased by eight percentage points, from  OLSTOSOSOZ     our. __label__Memo

Total estimated costs are $1,920,000.  BACKGROUND  The CARLTON Assault is a fully integrated effort with all the key elements (Advertising, Direct and Promotion)  focused to create maximum pressure against the retail environment and competitive smokers. It is a swift and powerful program designed to build business and capture new share.  The Assault program is a strategic tool reserved for highly developed growth opportunity areas -- success breeds  success. To achieve full impact, we continue to believe a full year of activity is required. Thereafter, the Assault strategy moves on to another strong area.  Section W-3 is our strongest CARLTON area with a 145 SDI (2.29 share). W-3 represents 6.64% of population and, more importantly, 9.61% of CARLTON sales.  W-3 is also scheduled to participate in the 1992 Future Bold expansion which will provide added S/O support.  CONNECTICUT ASSAULT RESULTS  MSA, which covers the entire store universe, is showing a  positive CARLTON share trend. Due to shipment volatility, we are examining three month moving shares.     970151581  PRODUC]        ED FROM B&W WEB SITE __label__Memo

“ gn &  ee,  gece SO Pay Er me  —_ ‘TOXICOLOGY. STUDIES” ON ETS  This note describes approaches to evaluate the toxicology of Environmental Tobacco smoke (ETS), using exposures of laboratory animals to sidestream smoke (SSS) and mainstream smoke (MSS). I have not taken into consideration any in vitro genetic toxicology, in that I think the testing should be on whole smoke and not on condensate. The animal work can be divided into 2 main areas :  -  - whole-body exposures of animals to SSS, and a comparison of the responses obtained with those obtained in animals exposed to room air.  - nose-only comparisons of MSS and SSS (at equi-TPM presentations)  In addition to the work on the "specific activity“ of ETS, I believe that the animal work should reflect those problems with ETS which the public conceive as being important. These include a cumulative “irritancy” (important both to the smoker and to the non-smoker), pulmonary carcinogenesis, and reproductive effects. There is also concern about the levels of nicotine and  carboxyhemoglobin seen in non-smokers as aresult of their exposure to S$5S.-  Finally, there seems to be recent evidence implicating immunosuppression in young children who are exposed to ETS.  The approach of exposing animals whole-body to SSS requires careful consideration. The doses suggested by the EPA as being the likely additive contribution of ETS to generalized air pollution (25ug per cubic meter) are very small indeed, and it could take technical skill to generate consistently such an aerosol for animal exposures. The levels are low enough to be within the noise levels of detection, and may be impractical for inhalation work (n.b. the doses are around one eighty-thousandth of the doses used routinely in our comparative inhalation studies with MSS). Assuming that such SSS levels are technically feasible, it is important to define against what TPM level this SSS concentration would be compared. It is clear that HEPA-filtered air with effectively zero TPM will have no effect on rats. Any SSS concentration will appear as being biologically more active than this control. There is thus no possibility of determining a NOEL using this approach. A better approach would be to compare $55 with ambient TPM levels found ina standard room with standard ventilation : current evidence shows that such rooms could reasonably be expected to have TPM concentrations of around 100 ug/m3. This should be the control exposure level. —  Notwithstanding the above, whale-body exposures to SSS could be achieved, possibly by using very large chambers, only a small number of cigarettes, very high dilution rates, and long exposures (e.g. 2@h/d). The-technical problems associated with such exposures are manifold, the most important probably being the lack of dosimetry data (the same problems exist for monitoring exposure to SSS in animals as exist for man). This is exemplified by the very low doses suggested : a doubling of the baseline level of blood carboxyhemoglobin resulting from endogenous production. This simple doubling would be very difficult to measure reproducibly. We are not sure at the moment if plasma nicotine can be used as a marker for SSS exposure. There are further complications related to the varying amounts of dilution which will be required to produce the different test aerosols. These different dilutions are likely to produce aerosols with different physical characteristics, which in turn may affect deposition in a major way. In whole-body exposures a very considerable part of the test aerosol is likely to deposit on the animal’s fur, and thence  /G6RLizZ4N0S }  ‘ 4 emit eneeeat ated Bone tse salem, tm __label__Report

Fountaine Date: June 23, 1971  Al Udow  A New Method of Qualitative Product Test Analysis  Background  The following quote is from a memo by E. J. Gray (10/29/69) who, under J. E. Lincoln, developed the current technique:  volume of response indicates the magnitude of a qualitative difference. In other words, the higher the percentage of given responses, the greater we assume the quality to be  wees  The second assumption that seems to exist is a cause and effect assumption. Granted, we rarely make the mistake of saying "Blend B lost the test because it was too strong", the implication is usually present. In other words, "Blend B. lost the test", Later we say "Blend  B was considerably stronger than Blend A". I feel that our readers put these two together.  Since the time that this issue was raised, we have tried two ways of settling the question. The present document is submitted as the third, and possibly definitive answer to the question, with new insights into understanding reasons for preference  of cigarettes, with implied new directions. for interpreting blind product test reports and new directions for R&D efforts.  Summary, Conclusions and: Recommendations  1. This document spells out in detail, and gives five examples of a new technique that should be added to: the analytic devices currently used in evaluating blind product tests. It should be given more weight in interpretation (because of greater sensitivity) than the current reporting of "qualitative evaluation",  2. The data used for this analysis should be drawn from the 18 point check list which smokers are asked to report on after testing each product, rather than the open ends. The former provides fuller data on larger bases, the latter gives some of the same kind of information but on much smaller bases.  3. Certain key conclusions can be generalized from the data on ten different  Products reported here, and they apply to all the groups of smokers covered, (including smokers: of Marliboro 85's, Marlboro 100's, other filters and hi-fi's),  1001857064 __label__Memo
TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  MEMORANDUM May 20, 1983  R. C. Young H. J. Minnemeyer  Outside Testing Budget  At the end of April the "Outside Testing" budget was underspent  by $323,  327. The seven activities itemized below, totaling  $351,720, generally account for underspending.  i.  Drug Enzyme Makeup ($30,000)  There has been an unexpected delay at Borriston Laboratories in implementing these tests on schedule.  Immunosuppression Studies ($4,000) Again, an unexpected delay at Borriston in implementing scheduled tests.  - Absorption-Distribution ($32,000):  There was a one month administrative delay at Research Triangle Institute as a new contract was initiated. This was followed by a further  2 month delay at Borriston Laboratories. We  do not know if it is possible to make up for lost time as these studies continue on a monthly basis.  CNS Activity Development ($7,500) This protocol development activity has not been initiated because of other commitments.                Acute Oral, 14-Day Subchronic, 90-Day Subchronic ($26,400) The test material (Dll, D12) was damaged in shipment. Then, Product Development changed the formula because of unanticipated problems with one of the ingredients. A new formulation has not been devised. During May and June budgeted charges amounting to $61,500 will not be accrued.     Skin Painting and Condensate Collection ($97,500) Mechanical equipment failure, technical delays, and delays due to price negotiations prevented the current study from starting as budgeted. In addition to the above, an additional shortfall of $35,000 will be incurred during May and June.  IZ°SL200 __label__Memo

-Epito  . The Honolulu Advertiser  Smoking bill               JUN @9 795 @2:34PM STARR SEIGLE MCCOMBS  R         Thursday, June 8, 1995  Restaurant ban should pass  The Honolulu City Council is on the verge of doing the right thing by banning smoking from public restaurants in Honolulu,  Council members should not be swayed by arguments that the dan will hurt business ‘or unfairly discriminate against the rights of smokers.  First, the economic argument:  Hotel and restaurant owners and operators are rightfully worried about a decline in business |? the ban goes inte  effect, Times aré rough enough |  without imposing yet another reason for folke not to patronize their establishments.  The fact is, however, that there is virtually no credible evidence that smoking bans hurt business in restaurants. Indeed, in city after'city, reputable studies of: tax receipts and other data have suggested that, if anything, business improves when the ban is in place, i  That makes sense. If a majority of us do not smoke, az is the case, then a regulation that appeals to the majority of customers should have a positive impact.  Honolulu is in an even stronger position than other cities. In California, for instance, there is always the potential for smoking customers to drive across county lines until they find a place where they can light up in a Testaurant. That wan't be possible here. .  A more subtle argument is the impact of such a ban on foreign visitors, particularly Japanese and Europeans who are more likely to be smokers than domestic customers.  Will they choose not to come here once they know they can't smoke while eating? Doubtful. - Travel decisions are made on - much larger issues than this. If Hawaii has to hang its hopes on attracting Japanese visitors on the issue of restaurant smoking, it is in bigger trouble than we think,  Then there is the issue of discrimination. It's true that the ban would inconvenience  [USE YOUR POWER | ‘The City Councit ia expected to take up the restaurant amoking  _ ben on June 21. For further information, call:  mi 527-5752  To tet Councl members know how you feel sbout the ban, you can aise call: .  ‘Ml District 1, Rene Mansha -  .— §87-7001  @ Ofetrict 2, Steve Holmes: 647-7002  Wi District 3, John Felix: 547-7003     * #9 Diseict 4, Cuke Sainum:  847-7004  @ Olatrict 5, Andy Midkitank 347-7005  ™ Dietrict 6, Jon Youhinure: 547-7008  8 District 7, Donna Kin: 547-7007  I Oletrict 8, Mufi Mannemann: 347-7008  @ Olsirict 9, John DeSote: 847-7009     smokers. Byt that’s true aiso for existing bans on smoking in  * workplaces, public build! elevators and the like. The  inconvenience ‘must be balanced against the unarguable health benefits of preventing exposure to second-hand smoke.  Most responsible emokera acknowledge they have no right to expose non-smokers to their habit. This ban would simply extend that thinking.  There is one illogical element te the proposed ban. It would not apply to bars and nightclubs, If the health argument is persuasive in restaurants, why not in bars?  The answer is pragmatics. Nightclubbing, drinking and  ing seem to be inextricably linked, The : proposed law simply concedes on that point.  Why couldn't the Council extend this logic and perhaps create a special category all-smoking restaurant? If some entrepreneur believed he could make money selling food in an establishment devoted exclusively to smokers, perhaps he should be allowed the opportunity.  It's hard to see where he would get workers or customers, however.        P.4  8822155807  & __label__News

It is now desirable to have available a routine procedure for the non-volatile, tobacco- specific nitrosamines in both processed tobacco and tobacco smoke. It is also planned to apply this method to indoor studies and to monitor NINO extracts.  PROCEDURES  A review of the current literature was made and there are several chromatographic methods available : rucl), GLC2-4) Gc-ms5), uprcé-8) and HPLC-TEAY) , Although the analysis  of NNN is the major goal, it is conceivable to incluée     other tobacco-specific nitrosamines such as NNK and N-nitroso-  anatabin (NAtB). The possible presence of the latter was first mentioned by Klus and Kuhn!) and later confirmed by mass spectrometry, for both tobacco and tobacco smoke?).  It is planned to apply GLC, HPLC and HPLC-TEA methods and to compare the results obtained in addition to the feasi-  bility to have a technician use a practical method on a routine basis.

MOLSON INDY  ie     By DAN PROUDFOOT Toronte Sun  e who qualifies 15th for the Molson Indy will blame his car’s setup. Bet on it. For that matter, anyone falling short of winning the pole may have a few choice words. for the way his car is handling.  Within minutes of the completion of Saturday's final qualifying, the common cry, up and down the pits, will be some- thing along the lines of , “We missed on the setup, the car just doesn't want to go around the turns.” Or, “the rear end tries to snap around on the cement patches.”  Setup: That combination of springs, shock absorbers or dampers, ride height front and rear, wing angles and driver's state of mind that determines how well a car consumes the turns, masters the  8, transfers power to the pavement This story is allabout missing t the setup.  Miss the setup?Does this leave you wondering? An engineer earning $500,000 or so per year and a race driver worth $3 million or more per annum, and together they can’t make their 930-horsepower, $750,000 Reynard do what it’s supposed to do? Why, exactly?  ‘The consequence of one car working better than another is tiny, but huge. At Long Beach this April — a street circuit like Toronto’s — Paul Tracy qualified 17th. The setup was hopeless.  Tracy's qualifying lap was 1.345 }  seconds slower than pole-winner Gil de Ferran’s. Imagine the difference of a Second and a bit measured over 1.968 miles, Tracy was despondent. Both he and de Ferran were driving Honda-powered Reynards with Firestone tires. His best. effort-couldn’t compensate for the fact his car’s setup wasn’t spot on.  It was Tracy who once uttered one of the more memorable descriptions of an ill- handling Penske car, following qualifying for a Molson Indy several years ago.  “Think of a shopping, cart with one of the front wheels sticking, that’s how this car feels.”  Tracy is now more circumspect. More experienced, too. In Long Beach, he un- derstood his car likely would be more com- petitive in race trim, The Team Kool Green engineers decided in desperation to change Tracy's car to the setup Greg Moore had used in Long Beach in 1999. Steve Challis, Moore’s long-time engineer, had brought the pertinent notes with him to TKG. Tracy went on to win the race.  “This new Reynard, at least for me, is a knife-edge kind of car,” Tracy reflected when asked why the pursuit of a workable setup is proving so much more difficult than in 1999,  “It’s either got a bunch of understeer or it’s got a bunch of oversteer. And I haven't heen able to find middle ground yet.”  Oversteer refers to the car wanting to pivot, with the tail leading the nose. A car with oversteer is said to be loose. An understeering car, on the other hand, is said to push: The driver turns the wheel but the car doesn’t turn in equal measure, its nose pushes toward the wall.  “Dario (teammate Dario Franchitti)  generally likes quite a bit of understeer ina car — and he can achieve that in this car,  TORONTO SUN Toronto, ON, CN July 13, 2000  July 14@ 15 616  ‘The Toronto Sun, Thureday July #3, 2000                1 Steering wheel display and driver input  2 Antiroll bar position sensors  & Roll hoop data download port  4 Rear wheel bearing temperature  § Tire radio antenna  6 Rear damper position sensors  7 Rear third spring position sensor  8 Rear wheel speed sensor  9 Front wheel speed sensor  10 Tire pressure sensor 11 Push rod load sensor 42 Front damper position sensor     2080721150  ABC's of a setup  | whereas I can’t deal with massive under- steer,” Tracy continued.  The 2000 Reynard is an evolutionary ' design, closely related to earlier Reynards. But two changes account largely for the knife-edge to which Tracy referred, First, CART mandated a smaller under-wing to ! prevent speeds from rising beyond current levels, by lessening downforce. Second, Firestone reacted to Goodyear pulling out of CART by creating harder tires that are longer lasting and safer, but offer less grip.  ‘Natural talent’  Morris Nunn may be the most celebrat- ed engineer within CART. Although he formed his own team this year, he worked | with Alex Zanardi and Juan Montoya as the Target/Chip Ganassi drivers won the four past championships in a row.  And yet Nunn points to the driver as a critical part in finding a workable setup. | _ After all, Zanardi was sensational at | Exhibition Place, but Montoya, in his maid- : en run last year, wasn’t Zanardi won the  1998 Molson Indy after finishin, ing second the previous two years. He qualified second, sixth and second here. And yet Montoya was an unhapy camper here, qualifying eighth and fis ing 22nd after contact.  “We have to believe that if a guy like Juan is not competitive, then it’s the ear,” said Nunn, “But ... a driver has to help (in | developing the setup of a car). Now, I found with Juan that he is not a technical guy, ; he just has a natural talent.”  Nunn cannot remember as a certainty, but he suspects the problem in Toronto was Firestone supplying a newly- developed tire, His setup that had been successful in earlier years did not work as well with the new tires’ different level of grip. Now Nunn needed to develop a new setup on the basis of what the Colombian prodigy reported.  “The feedback from Juan was not as good as the feedback from Zanardi, or from Bryan Gerta, filling in for the injured Tony     |     Kanaan). Juan would say to me, many times, ‘Just get it somewhere near and I'll do the rest.’  “He'd get out of the car and say, ‘OK, it’s close enough,’ or, ‘Oh, the car is s—t.’ Which. doesn’t tell you anything. So it is difficult (to take steps to make the car work hetter).”  Nunn, in contrast to Tracy, views the Reynard’s tendency to understeer as a constant over the past five years, Yet, high- lighting the different behaviour patterns perceived by different drivers, Nunn became convinced early this year that somehow the push was gone.  “With Alex, Jimmy (Vasser) and Juan, these cars always had understeer,” Nunn explained. “That’s what we were improving all the time, that’s what was controlling entry and mid-corner speed.  “Now I have my own team and a new driver, Tony Kanaan, and when Tony got in this car, he said, ‘There's no understeer whatsoever. The car goes everywhere I want it to go.”  “You wonder, how did they achieve that with the same uprights and suspension geometry, nothing changed. In fact I called Alex and said he'd be amazed, this car has no understeer.  More grip  “But we go to Portland last month end Bryan, filling in for Tony, gets out of the ear and says, ‘Understeer! You turn the wheel, the front end washes out.”  This sort of confusion delights Nunn, because he can figure it out. And it demon- strates how finding the perfect setup depends on understanding your driver.  Tony Kanaan is a late braker, braking  not only as he approaches @ turn, but as’  he begins turning the steering wheel. The | weight transfer from the braking affords the front wheels more grip: They turn more effectively,  Qualifying setup and race setup, of course, are drastically different. In qualify- ing the driver storms the track, in Tracy's  | words pushing to 110%, hecause the only Bn is the fastest single lap.  “Team Kool Green certainly hasn’t done la real good job with the qualifying setups, | we've done good with the race setups,” said ' team owner Barry Green. | “We want the car basically in qualifying ; to go as fast as we possibly can, We want the car in race conditions to go fast, but | the driver to be very comfortable over the race distance, There’s a big difference.”  Ayear ago, Tracy and engineer Tony Cicale, who rejoined the team mid-season, were considered the epitome of success- ful chemistry betwixt driver and engineer. Tracy invariably qualified among the top five — after having struggled through 1998 to break into the top 10.  I This year, with different tires and less downforce, they’re still a formidable part- nership but they're not qualifying where the want to be. i “It’s a complex issue,”Cicale said when . asked about the difficulty. “A driver might : report that the car is understeering, in i effect it might be understeering — but that may not be the limit of what his lap time is.  “His lap time might be deficient because of a traction problem. Now, he might nat rate that very high. So it’s really quite important to understand not only what the car is doing, but to come to some conclu- | sion, If we make the understeer better, will we go faster?’ Or, ‘If we make the traction better, will we go faster?’  “So it’s quite important that the driver determines not only what he doesn’t like about the car, but also kind of prioritizes that and determines, ‘Will that affect my Jap time?’”  The Tracy-Cicale ship's progress in solving such cae Pe ahtioe remarka- | ble or distressing, will become only too | obvious Saturday afternoon.  Meanwhile, reflect on Morris Nunn’s | considerable wisdom.  “These things are not easy,” he said. “IE it-was, then we'd win every race.” __label__News

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  TO: Field Sales Force DATE: April 13, 1995  FROM: Craig Johnson/Senior VP, Sales SUBJECT: Ask Fir It's the Law (5/30 - 7/2  Selling cigarettes to minors is against the law. It's that simple. While PM USA does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers, PM USA has always advocated that retail accounts comply with the law.  One of the ways to further support the Company's commitment regarding restricting the sale of cigarettes to minors is to reinforce this principle with our accounts and their employees. Importantly, retailers nationwide have been asking us for assistance in complying with their state laws.  As a result, we are providing you with enhanced program materials to use with your accounts. These program materials were successfully tested in Cincinnati in the fourth quarter of 1994. Our focus with accounts begins in June and July, with continuous program support in the balance of 1995. Program details are outlined below.  Current Situation The law holds retailers responsible for selling tobacco products legally. Retailers that sell cigarettes  to minors may be subject to fines, a loss of their licenses and possibly even jail time.  Key _ Issue How do we help to inform and educate retailers and their employees regarding their responsibilities  to enforce their state laws?  The Plan In June and July, place the "Ask First/It's the Law" program in all workload accounts during normal  call coverage. Then continue to place materials during 1995, making this part of your in-store mission.  Here's How _it Works * Selli idelin - Sell the program to all accounts as a value-added service, beginning May 30 , 1995  - Thoroughly review the program materials to ensure that retailers understand their responsibilities.  - A copy of the Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story is enclosed and can be accessed via the Si Support-File Server in the folder entitled "Ask First/It's the Law Sell-in Story."

RJR CONFIDENTIAL  To: Phil Robchewski From: Ed Hardman  Subject: Doral Pricing Strategy Date: June 14, 1995  This documents a revision we need to make asap to the decision rules for determining whether Doral is on/off strategy. In response to increased GPC promotion activity, Doral’s ceiling has been increased to $3.00 in 9 regions, effective June 1. Attached is a copy of the memo from Cliff to Andy detailing the change. I’ve summarized it for our purposes below.  ® In 9 regions, increase the Doral ceiling to $0.30/$3.00 in all outlets. These regions are MWSA, Northern and Southern California, and Seattle.  * For all remaining regions, keep the ceiling as is. That is $0.20/$2.00 in all outlets except CO’s, where the ceiling is $0.30/$3.00.  ¢ Make this effective in the data for next Saturday’s update. I understand it is not possible to rerun the back data to make this effective for the first two weeks in June in the trended reports currently under development.  The timing on this revision appears to be open. Please keep these revised cciling levels for Doral in place in the affected regions until further notice. It is possible and even likely that other regions may be added to this list in the future.

Dear Friends,  The just-released EPA Report is an important new weapon in the war to protect nonsmokers’ rights. As many have request - ed, we've made it available in a form you can use wherever you:  @ Work  @ Fat out a  a  Have your hair cut, your car repaired, or Visit an office or other workplace.  The EPA Report concludes that secondhand tobacco smoke is a "Group A carcinogen" like asbestos, and that it causes serious health problems for millions of children every year.  ASH worked hard to protect the report from tobacco- industry sabotage. We succeeded: the interrogations of EPA staff  by the tobacco industry ceased, and the secret EPA compendium on the dangers was made available to the public.  Now, like you, we want to be sure that we make the most of this dynamite report. THAT’S WHY WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.  ASH will be using the EPA Report to help persuade legislators to ban — not just restrict — smoking in public  places. Some already have, but WE NEED YOUR HELP IN REACHING. MORE OF THEM.  ASH is also informing businesses — including fast-food restaurants, airlines, and others — about the EPA report. But  often its conclusions must be brought to their attention person- ally before they will act. This is especially true of small and local businesses. THAT’S ONE REASON WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW!  So ASH has taken the major findings of the report and added legal threats and additional arguments for businesses to  ban smoking. Then we combined them all in a brochure for OUR SUPPORTERS TO MAIL, POST, AND — MOST IMPORTANTLY — HAND OUT!  We know that even this brief brochure can be very  effective, but only if it is placed in the hands of decision- makers across the country. THAT’S WHERE YOU COME IN!

wn  FILE nore” ly 7 {eh  SUBJECT: Di ions in D mber 12.  The following was agreed:  l.  A KOOL CPT needs to be put into place as soon as possible in order to gauge our recommended product against the grow- ing SALEM Lights product. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please liaise.  It was agreed to conduct group discussions with the younger franchise smokers in order to better evaluate current KENT films. Clearly, the smokers in the previous group discus- sions were older than the smokers who currently are going to imported American products.  It was agreed in principle to put a charcoal filter on KENT Parent King Size and Deluxe as well as raise the delivery to the 15 or 16 mg. level. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please make a recommendation on product.  It was agreed to introduce KENT Luxury Mild 100's in hinge lid format at Yen 250/280 in order to upgrade the image of KENT and to compete in the growing 250/280 category.  It was agreed to focus our support towards growth in the higher priced segments. Accordingly, Joel Silverstein will revise the spend plan on LUCKY STRIKE to ensure that it is optimal even if this means reducing some support on KENT.  Joel Silverstein will review the analyticals on VOGUE and CAPRI Menthol versions. There are trade reports that triers of CAPRI Menthol are returning to VOGUE Menthol, and the region believes that there may be a product difference which explains this. Prior to doing any CPT's, it is necessary to get a full analytical evaluation. Linc Lewis and Herb Woertz please do the same here and give us a view.  Joel Silverstein will prepare a plan for expansion and sup- port of CAPRI for discussion here in Louisville. It is to be here in early January.  A capital proposal will need to be developed for the sales  force software program. Joel Silverstein will have that here by the first week of January.  632000720 __label__Report

Uy, INTER-OFFICE CORRESPOND E® ¢  Cr, UY te BY Chester, Virginia © G - : “hg \ \ To: Ms. Dawn Saunde Date: May 18, 1992 From: Denise Donaher DOD  Subject: Wiegand Evaporator Evaluation Status - 5/18/92  Turbofan operation  Fan vibration was monitored relative to daily fan washes and results indicate that the spray nozzle does reduce turbofan vibration in some cases. For example, on 5/14 fan vibration decreased from 5.7 mm/sec to 3.7 mm/sec after the fan was cleaned. Investigation work is continuing to assess the feasibility of  caustic or citric spray to the fan and to determine the need for surge protection in our system.  Cleaning of the Evaporator  Lab services is in the process of setting up new test methods for * acid and % caustic using the automatic titrator at Bermuda Hundred. _ A test. request has. been-.completed to begin baseline’ testing. However, due to the Memorial Day shutdown and CIP  schedules, the sampling has been delayed and is estimated to begin on 5/29.  A detailed review of the citric acid product data sheets and material safety data sheets has revealed that there are some potentially significant differences between Nalco, Chemtreat, and Industrial citric acids. The Nalco and Chemtreat citric acids appear to be a blend of citric acid with other dispersing agents  while Industrial citric contains only citric acid. Samples will be pulled for further evaluation.  In order to further determine the source and amount of particulate materials in the system, plans are to open the top of the evaporator and clean/inspect the distribution plates prior to a CIP, immediately after a CIP, and three days later prior to the  next CIP, This evaluation will be conducted as production/maintenance schedules allow.  Baseline solubles testing of the individual passes was conducted from 4/29 through 5/7. The results are summarized in the attached table. Each set of data represents the time between a CIP. The results indicate very repeatable performance of each pass. The results are being evaluated relative to the number of tubes in each  pass. Similar testing will be conducted on a monthly basis to monitor the process for changes.  xC: Barfield, Bullock, Long, Saunders, Sharkey, Thomas  «031562974 __label__Memo

Pwon Witham ts ayy © Protocol Ws Con Sre frei Ctl  Once a suitable smoking population is established from a careful review of the questionnaires, the subjects will be divided into two groups of 16 subjects each. The first group will be designated Group A and will be made up of smokers who have smoked at least 1 pack of cigarettes with yields of 1 mg tar and 0.1 to 0.2 mg nicotine (note Gori used 5 cigarettes as a minimum). The second, Group B, will consist of smokers who have smoked at least 1 pack of medium tar and nicotine cigarettes, e.g., 7 to 12 mg tar and 0.5 to 1 mg nicotine. ,  All subjects must be told the nature of the study being carried out, C.0e5 estimating the amount of smoking by measuring metabolites in blood, and that the study involves commercially available cigarettes.  Randomization of 32 subjects within groups A and B into subgroups A and Ay and  By and By will be carried out as follows:  Subjects in Group A and those in Group B will be listed in alphabetical order and assigned a number between 1 and 16. For the first week odd numbered sub- jects will be given Barclay cigarettes to smoke and even numbered subjects will be given Now cigarettes to smoke. For the second week the odd numbered subjects will be given Now cigarettes to smoke and the even numbered subjects will be given Barclay cigarettes. All subjects will be given a medium tar and nicotine yield cigarette, e.g., Vantage (9 mg tar, 0.7 mg nicotine) for the third week.  Cigarettes  To insure representative samples of each of the brands of cigarettes, it is desirable to pool all the cigarettes for each of the 3 brands needed in the study, then randomize and repack the cigarettes in unmarked packs (except for same code number that will identify the'test cigarettes but not: the brand). Each smoker will receive an excess number of cigarettes, e.g.. 1 pack more than the amount listed by the subject in his questionnaire (to prevent running out of cigarettes and smoking cigarettes other than those assigned).  9Ppes STTTsS  Arthur DLittle Inc __label__Report

A cheritable trust. the Tobacco Products Research Trust, was set up to administer the  to difterentiate between effects of different tvpes of products. in wew of difficulties in establishing smoking histories adequatety in observational studies. and of the risk of bias when smokers switch to lower tar products as a result of developing symptoms. Thus the “core” study at St. Thomas's was developed on that basis. and delays in embarking on the research programme as a whole were due lergety to the need to approach this large-scale high-cost study very carefully, with the introduction of an additional “pre-pilot™ stage before the optimum design could be settied. and there were & number of unforeseen problems that had to be overcome. |  The tar reduction component of the studies at St. Bartholomew's, and the tar retention work at Harwell also involve intervention. but thére are fundamental difficulnes in extending this theorencaity desirable approach to the whole field of the T  actrvines. Not only are costs per subject high. but ethical considerations de the intervention spproach in respect of some types of study (such as those concerned with effects in pregnancy). and it clearly cannot be used to examine slowty-developing Conditions over periods of many years. Hence the Committees has approved several other epidemiqiogcial studies. mainty in the cardio-vascular field, thet are of Observational type. A need has aiso been seen for a number of experimental studies. to  -beern more of the croperties and behaviour of the smoke from modified products. In  this, and in respect of other features, links have been established between a number of the studies funded by the Trust. The same representative cigarettes are. for example, included in the large epidemiological study (St. Thomas's), the human smoking - experimental work (Harwell) and the mutagenicity studies st Swansea. Information on enstytical procedures is exchanged. and in some cases samples are cross-checked by Gitferent methods between the various centres. or sent to a central laboratory for _ . assessment.  Provision has aiso been made to poo! data from all the prospective mortality studies that the investigators are involved in, whether or not the basic funding is from the Trust. In these and other ways the Commnttee has attempted to develop an integrated programme. winch in the past year has been extended. following up some of the earlier pelot work and filling some gaps thst remasned on the scope of Ms actit.o1 ft & hoped that some of the more recent expermental studies funded will complement the esrker enetomiunlnne al em Aee     EL8O Lz8es __label__Report

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT - Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: P. F. Grantham \\ Date: August 18, 1994 From: A. I. Goldsmith \\  Subject: Collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays  L. T. Kozlowski is the individual who has published information on examining spent cigarette filters for evidence of ventilation hole blocking. Attached are abstracts of five papers he has published on this  subject; please note that the search strategy was not a priori restricted to Kozlowski. The abstracts do not make explicit statements regarding the source of the butts used in the studies, so it is impossible to  pinpoint one that may have entailed collecting cigarette butts from ashtrays, without reading the actual  papers. If none of the papers is the one you are seeking, the next step probably should be to look at the cited papers and the subsequent papers citing Kozlowski’s publications.  The attached abstracts are from the psycINFO {DIALOG: File 11}, EMBASE {Excerpta Medica; DIALOG: File 73}, and SCISEARCH {ISI’s Science Citation Index; DIALOG: File 434} databases. You probably  have copies of the articles already, but if you do not you may call either Sharonda Crenshaw (eat.  4802) or the general Library extension of 2877. If you require a citation search, or if I can be of further assistance in any other way, please feel free to call me at ext. 5352.

CHARGE NUMBER: 6904  PROJECT TITLE: BIOCHEMICAL METHODS DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION  PERIOD COVERED! March 1-31, 1982  PROJECT LEADER: R. M. McCuen  DATE OF REPORT: April 1, 1982  1. L5178Y THYMIDINE KINASE MUTATION ASSAY?:?     From recent experiments andi a reevaluation of all the data concerning potential inactive (negative) chemicals tested in this system, two agents in presence or absence off microsomal activation were found to produce no mutagenic response: while causing a dose related: increase in toxicity. The chemicals demonstrating these effects, and thus. were judged to be inactive in this bioassay, were ethanol and nicotine (tested as nicotine tartrate). Both of these ageniis have been termed negative in other in vitro and. in vivo: assays. The importance of this work is that in our laboratories this bioassay does not show that every agent tested produces a positive biological response. For any in vitro assay to be useful, it must be able to distinguish between chemicals which are known to give a positive or negative response in other test systems. With these experiments, we now have more confidence in the ‘usefulness of the L5178¥/TK'/- bioassay at PM.     2. V79' CHINESE HAMSTER CELL MUTATION ASSAY?     An excellent dose response was obtained using these cells treated with DMBA and hamster liver S9.as the source of activation. As expected, no response was observed in the absence of S9. [In the previous experiment, little or no dose-response was seen with hamster S9 because too high a dase was tested.] A second experiment was completed this month using DMBA and and rat Hiver $9 as the source of activation. [Rat liver S9 is the activation system of choice used in other ini vitro assays at PM.] The results from. this experiment revealed that, as expected, DMBA was. active only im the presence of rat liver $9. An almost linear, four point. dose response was observed. The most important finding was that at least for this chemical the shape and magnitude of the dose response curve was. almost identical regardless of the source of the microsomal activation (rat. or hamster liver $9). This. suggests that rat liver S9:' can be used in future experiments where metabolic activation is required,     3. REFERENCES  1. Penn, d. M. and Ayers, D. J. Notebook No. 7669, pp. 127-130. 2.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017  Ehud Houminer DATE: March 3, 1986  Victor Tinueci  Sale of “Rothmans" brands by Philip Morris under license in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean  As you know, Philip Morris Incorporated has a license from Rembrandt Group Limited, whereby Philip Morris may exploit certain cigarette brands  in the U.S.A. and Latin America/Caribbean.  For calendar year 1985, the sales results for all thase licensed brands  have been: Volume (Units) U.S.A. 162,179,720 U.S.A. Duty — Free 102,740,400 Export to Latin America/Caribbean 67,610,000  TOTAL 332,530,120  The cigarettes have been made for Philip Morris on a contract manufacture basis by Rothmans Canada, Rothmans International and Liggett Group. The marginal contribution after contract manufacture, but befora any expenses, is approximately $9 per 1000 cigarettes i.e. almost $3 million. The royalty owed to “Rembrandt” on such cigarette sales is  $96,337.14 for calendar 1985.  There is also the smoking tobacco sublicense from Philip Morris to Lane Limited. On these sales, Philip Morris Incorporated retains $90,907 in royalty income, while a royalty of $45,453.50 has been paid to Rembrandt  Group's U.S.A. subsidiary Larus & Brother Company.  New License from Swiss company  There has been some concern about Philip Morris Ineorporated's continued participation as the seller and distributior of these cigaratte brands.  A suggestion has been made to substitute a new licenson (i.8. 4a Swiss company). This option has been examined, but appears extremely complicated and impractical. The only feasible way to arrange this license from a Swiss Company would be via a New Agreement. A new license agreement from a Swiss company would have the following effects.  Pro Bo continuing license or distribution relationship with a South African  company.  ES9ELLE Loz __label__Memo

You may use them any way you like. I listed the components of total respiratory so it would be clear that asthma, bronchitis, tuberculosis and respiratory cancer were included as well as emphysema and bronchitis, and that the separate rates are included in the total rates. The rates for the last two conditions are too small to consider separately.  This makes quite a case for improved classification, After going down with the introduction of antibiotics, influenza and pneumonia are now going the same route as reported respiratory cancer mortality. The so called Hong Kong flu in 1968, gave that death rate another jump, so it is on the general ascendant course, |  My work on the longer document continues. I have all the mortality data on hand and will make a report with Bill Alban in the next two or three  weeks,  I have my other file of cases completely processed for Negroes, but not quite complete for Latins and Anglos. That is, they are coded and punched, but need to be checked for duplicates, When I have the printout of the 40,000 plus cases in Houston, and compare them with the 200, 000 plus deaths from all causes, I will first check the 162, 163 classifications and see what the facts were, I have been asked to put this article in the Inter- national Journal of Cancer. The awareness that 23 years of total popula- tion base cancer cases in Houston are available and may be checked against total deaths from all causes in Houston has caused a great deal of anticipa- tion. At the Tenth International Cancer Congress in Houston, I had a steady stream of visitors in Epidemiology; the only meetings I was able to attend  ‘        CTR SP-FILES OOLGi4 __label__Letter

This letter given below from Dr. E.T.Krebs, Jr  Dear Howard: gives the position of this matter  as of September, 7, 1962. HHB,  Many thanks for your letter of 30 August. I have been so busy of late that I have neglected writing my very best friends, most trusted associates, and loyal Beardians. Like the prophet, Abdullah, you head the list.  One filing about sixty days ago was made with the Federal Food and Drug Administration, This consisted of about nineteen pages and could be considered a memorandum of information. Notice has been received that this filing is incomplete. I have prepared another fil- ‘ing that will amount to almost 400 pages, and I trust that this filing will be considered complete. The statutory limit for notification on a filing is sixty days, as you know; however, in some cases noti- fication is given earlier than this.  You can advise your physician friends that a new drug application of almost 400 pages has been made to the Federal Food and Drug Admin~ istration and that a similar filing will be made with the corresponding California agency within the next few days.  I want to thank you for your intense and continuing efforts in the cause of Beardlanism. I appreciate very much what you say about the pressure you are receiving from doctors, since we are feeling a bit of this ourselves.  As I may have told you, Doctor M.W. McDougall of 529 Bast 10th Street, Long Beach, California, is working on the Beard Anthrone  - Test. Perhaps you would like to drop him a line to welcome him to the club,  Cordially yours,  Ernst T.

a tb  ea7 18:47 wCOV & BUR . Pos  DRAFT: March 22, 1989  Environmental Tobacee smoke and {ts Relat. oO Ty ce  Public debate recently has focused on the ef- feote of amoking on nonsmokers. Those who argue for widespread bans on smoking sometimes claim that nonsmokers can suffer lung cancer as the result of exposure to envi- ronmental tobacco smoke ("ETS"), which is the smoke that enters the air either from the end of the burning cigarette or when exhaled by smokers. Scientific re- search, however, has failed to support this claim. To the contrary, as the American Cancer Society recently recog- nized, "the currently available evidence is not sufficient to conclude that passive or involuntary smoking causes lung cancer in nenemokers * * * xo  The Cancer Society reached its conclusion de~- spite the fact that some studies have suggested that expo+ sure to ETS can increase a nonsmoker’s risk of contracting lung cancer by 35 to 40 percent, * Implicit in the Cancer Study’s conclusion is the recognition that there exist strong reasons to doubt the validity of these estimates. Among other things, the pertinent studies frequently have igno fundamental maxims of scientific research, reach- ing conclusions without taking account of all the factors that may contribute to the development of a disease such as lung cancer.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. O INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  JAN 3 0 92  Richmond, Virginia  coor,  To: Distribution Date: January 29, 1992  From: J. I. Seeman: eyo 2emn—  Subject: Annual Accomplishments *  The Chemical Applications Section of the Chemical Research Division consists of two projects, Inorganic Synthesis led by Ken Podraza and Organic Synthesis led by Yoram Houminer. The reorganization which led to the current reporting system within CRD occurred in July 1991. Please review the attached highlights of the annual accomplishments in. preparation for the Annual Review Meeting to be held next Wednesday, February 5, 1992, at 10 am in Al Conference Room.  Both projects, together, provide fundamental and applied core technologies in areas of organic, inorganic, physical, environmental, thermal and analytical chemistry, in addition to separation science, sensory technology, tobacco alkaloid chemistry and pharmacology, and to lesser extent, in the areas of radiolabelled synthesis, materials science, paper technology, and encapsulation chemistry.  The Inorganic Chemistry project has devoted the major portion of its 1991 effort to the development of novel, proprietary inorganic fillers which, when incorporated into paper and cigarettes, results in significantly reduced visible sidestream smoke with acceptable subjectives and ash:characteristics. In addition, this project has participated in the development of technologies for use in various environmental issues which face our  manufacturing facilities.  The Organic Chemistry project has participated in the development of a stable menthol delivery product as well as in the development of materials which will reduce the irritation percepts of sidestream smoke, primarily in the «-hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) release area. In the last few months, the project has begun to investigate the chemistry of  various Cast Leaf, NBL, and related processes. In particular, the rate of pectin release, the effect of particle size on sheet parameters, and alternative binders are being examined.  C92-03077  S2SS2PT2Z02  ry __label__Memo

DRAFT LETTER TO RURT OFFICERS  Date  Name Address  Dear  I am sure you recognize the extent to which our future success depends  on decisions made by elected officials in Washington and the state capitals. Anti-tobacco groups are intensifying their efforts to achieve a "smoke-free society,” and supporters of our industry in Congress and the state legis- jatures are finding it more difficult and politically costly to take a stand on our behalf.  If we are to improve the legislative climate, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco must dramatically increase its involvement in the political process. We must continually ask elected officials for their support, and it is vital that we be in a position to support them in return. As you know, the RJR Political Action Committee is the best means available for our company to financially support candidates who will consider our views intelligently and fairly. However, for a variety of reasons, current PAC receipts are inadequate to  meet cur increasing needs.     The RJR PAC deserves your most serious consideration and attention. Parti- cipation in the PAC is voluntary, and no rewards or penalties are involved, but any officer who is unwilling to make an investment in R. J. Reynolds Tobacce’s future by supporting the PAC fails to recognize the importance of the challenges we face in the political process.  Enclosed is a membership form and a return envelope for the RJR PAC. The  suggested contribution rate for the RJR PAC is .6% -- recognizing that officers are also asked to contribute .4% to The Tobacco Institute PAC for a  total of 1% gross salary. Payroll withholding is, of course, the preferred method of participation in the RJR PAC. A contribution form for TIPAC will] be sent te you after the first of the year.

eg 124  DRAFT     Confidential - Prepared for Covington and Burlin     L-Glutamine CAS RN 56-85-9 Glutamine  CAS RN 6899-4-3  Abstract:  L-Glutamine has been characterized as a nonessential or nutritionally dispensable amino acid but recent studies suggest that it may be a conditionally essential nutrient, particularly in catabolic disease states. As a flavorant, L-glutamine has essentially no taste or odor and its main contribution is probably in the production of "secondary flavorings" which make their appearance in the course of oxidative or enzymatic action. These so-called Maillard-type products are produced when glutamine reacts with reducing sugars to produce substances with both characteristic taste and flavor. L-Glutamine is listed as’ GRAS by  FEMA (#3684) and is approved for food use by FDA.  Few acute or chronic toxicity studies for L-glutamine have been reported. For the mouse, an oral LDeg of 21.7 g/kg was reported  and for the rat, a LD 7.5 g/kg orally was reported.  50 -  566614581 __label__Report

Aithough endocytic internalization of EGFR may be thought to attenuate EGF-stimulsted signaling, recent evidence sugyvets that signaling through Ras can be amplified by repeated en- counters of endosome-localized, receptor She-Grb3-Sos complexes with the plasms membrane, where Ras re- sides almost exclusively. Based on these reports, we a7: amined EGFR trafficking hehavior in a set of single and double ¢-BrevEGFR C3H101T% overaxpressors to datver- mine if e-Sre affects basal receptor half-life, ligand-in- duced internalization, and/or recycling. Our results show that overexpreasion of c-Sre causes Bo change in EGFR half-life but dose produce ap increase in the in- ternalization rate conetant of EGF-EGFR complexes when the endocytic apparatus is not stoichiometrically saturated; this effect of c-Src on EGFR endocytosis is negligible at high receptor occupancy in eells overez- preaming the receptor. in neither case are EGFR recycling rate constants affected by o-Sre. These data indicate a functional role for oSre in receptor internalization, which in turn could alter some aspects of EGFR eignal- ing related to mitogenesis and tumorigenesis.  OO  The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a 170-kDs transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that binds a number of related peptide growth factors, inchading epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-a. Binding of ligand ts EGFR induces cransphoepborylation on several C- terminal tyrosyl reaidues, which upon phosphoryiation bind the SH2 domains of various signaling molecules, including Shc, Grb2, PLCy (1, 2), and Shp2 (3). Aasociation of these molecules with ths EGFR results in their activation, either vis changes in subcellular localization (thereby bringing them into jurtaposi- thon with their substrates) or by tyrosyl phosphorylation (in- ducing conformational changes and enzymatic activation).  i * This work waa supported by Natonal Institutes of Health Grant CA8#213 and Nanonal Science Foundation Grant BES-9596153 ito D.

EGFR has been linked to the process of oncogenens pa well as to normal mitogenesis. The chicken proto-oncogene for EGFR was one of the first cellular genes found to be transduced by a retrovirua and shown to function es an oncogene (see for example Ref, 5), Increased exprvssicn of EGFR is seen in many human tumors, including giioblasomas/nsuroblastomas and carcinomas of the breast, bladder. kidney, stomach. ovary, prostate, and lung (6-10), suggesting & vole for EGFR in the etiology of these diseases. In some experrmental eal! systems. i of EGFR by itself leads to malignant transfor. mation when celle are grown is the conminucus presence of EGF {1L, 12).  Callular Sre (c-Sre) is a 60-kDa nonreceptor tyrosine Kinase, the first proto-oncogens identified is humans. Arole for ¢-Sre mn EGFR-mediated responses has been demonstrated by a pum- ber of studies. First, overexpression of wild-type ¢-Sre in C3H10TY murine Sbroblaswe expressing normal levels of re- eeptor (3-10 X iC” receptors/cell) potenhated £GF-directed maitogenesis, whereas overexpression of dominant negative variants of c-Sre not only ablated the enhanced mitogenic re- eponse but alac interferred with the endogenous reaponse (13, 14), These findings indicated that ¢-Sre is required for EGF- induced mitogenemis, a conciumon wubwtantiated by Roche (15). In mubsequant rvudies, Mas et al. (16) reported that overexpres- aon of both e-Sre and EGFR in 10T% cells (1-3 x 10! receptors’ cell} resulted in synergistic increases in EGF-dependent growth and tumor formation in nude mice.  The mechaxusm(s) by which c-Src influences the biological action of the EGFR are not entirely elucidated, although sev- eral studies have provided clues to the problem. c-Src bas been found aasciated with EGFR in bream cancer call lines (17).* in Sbroblasta overerpreasing both c-Sre and the recaptor (16), and in A431 colle (19), In Sbrobiasts, this association is EGF-de- pendent and reqults in the appearance of two novel tyrosy! pbosphorytetions on the receptor and increased phoephoryla- tion of receptor substrates in vivo (16). These findings ruggest that ¢-Sire potentiates the action of the EGFR by binding to it and inducing ita phosphorylation, resulting in bypersctivation of the receptor and enhanced downstream signaling. Several svadies have attempted to localize the site of ¢-Sre binding to the receptor, unng in vitro peptide competition approaches (17, BO, 21), Tyr-982 ws the most consisentiy poticed site, but other ‘Tyr residues have also been implicated, suggesting that ¢-Gre mey bind muitple mtes. Acnvacon of eSre folowing EGF stimulation of Sbroblasts overerpreaning EGFR has also been reported (22, 23), suggesting that the two tyrosine nnases are capable of mutual) reguianon.  Oe 14S.

6.  > 5. "Cigarette smoking and UDL cholesterol: the Fram- ingham Offspring Study" -- R. J. Garrison, Framingham. This study dealt with the relation of cigarette smoking to high density lipoproteins (IDL), high levels of which are con- Sidered a protective factor in C]HD,:in 2449 females and 1958 males aged 20-49. Adjustment was made for obesity and alco- hol intake. The subjects were part of the Framingham Off- spring Study, itself a part of the overall Framinham Heart Study.  Cigarette smoking was found to decrease HDL in smokers who drank little or no alcohol. Former cigarette smokers (off cigarettes at least a year) and cigar or pipe smokers who had never smoked cigarettes had HDL comparable to those  of nonsmokers. Cigarette exposure appears directly related to HDL level.  The data suggest another explanation for the association of cigarette smoking with atherosclerosis. "If, indeed, cig- arette smoking aggravates atherosclerosis by lowering HDL levels, then the question of whether cessation of smoking and return to higher NDL levels leads to remission of ath-  \ Smoneneness needs attention."  6. "Influence of cigarette smoking on the natural his- tory of coronary artery disease" ~- Thomas Gaardcr, Downey, Yy Cal. In a poster session, Gaarder reported a study in which progressive obstructive artery disease (POD) was measured in 135 men and women by coronary arteriography 10-54 months after initial examination. POD, defined as any increase in obstruction greather than 25%, occurred in 54 patients; of these 43 went on to total occlusion.  POD relative to the presence of single (i1VD), double (2VD) or triple (3VD) vessel disease was measured at four time intervals. The effect of blood sugar, lipids, blood pressure, and cigarette smoking on POD also was analyzed at each time interval in the 2VD and 3VD groups. The most significant factor related to POD at each time interval was smoking. The 2VD and 3VD groups showed rapid POD; that in 1VD was much less. It was concluded that smoking had a sig- nificant adverse effect on coronary change.  7.

The development of appropriate methods for exposing cell cuttures to whole smake are necessary for evalualing the biological activity of environmental lobacce smoke (ETS) in mammalian and bacterial cells. Tho cellular smake exposure technique (CSET) uses a rocking apparatus that allows cells to oscillate between exposure to a known smoke concentration and cuhure medium maintained at 37°C. The neutral red assay in WB rat       1991 EMS ABSTRACTS VW  ler colls and an Ames assay were used 10 assess Cytotoxicity and mutagenicily, respectively, Maiastroam smoke generated from 1H4F feleronce cigaretes was used 10 characterize tne CSET. WB cells were txposed for one Or two hours to varying Mainstream smoke concentrations (40 lo 640 mg total paniculate matier(TPM)/m) The TASB Salmonella bactoria were exposad tor two hours to a mainstream smoke concentration of 320 mg TPM/m”. The cytotoxicity of 1A4F mainstream smoke to rat liver Celis was concentration and time dependent with no abserved effect levels for one and two hour exposures of approximalely 160 and 40 mg TPM/in?, fespectively. The TAS8 Salmonella strain exhibited approximataly a two-old increase in the number of revenanis/plale after exposure to tR4F mainstream smoke and an $9 metabolic activation system. WB cat liver epithetiat cells and the TASB Salmonetia bacterial strain were exposed to a telavant concentration of ETS (approximately 1.5 mg TPM/m*) for three hours. Using the neutral red cytoloxicity and Ames Mutagenesis assays there were no differences observed in the ETS-exposed cells and their fespociive room air controls, indicating that ETS was biologically inactive as tested.

WPA discussed considerations on the re-formation and research objectives of the future Research Council. There was unanimity that the Research Council in its existing composition and objectives is defined too narrowly for the current problems and that therefore the remit of the next Research Council should be formulated more widely and not only specifically tobacco industry oriented. There was also unanimity on the fact that the existing period of office of the Research Council of 3 years is too short. There were adverse comments by WPA on the legal status of a foundation, introduced into the discussion by Prof. A.  A working group dealing with the future Research Council and consisting of Messrs Wille (PMG), Kénig (VDC), Herter (BAT) and Wieckmann (REE) came, at its first meeting, to the conclusion that the person of Prof. Thurau is of particular importance in the formation of the next Research Council.  Note     A paper about the 1990 Research Council, elaborated by U. Beecken and W. Fink for G. Wille, regards the elaboration of the scientific principle of the importance of endogenic exposure vs. exogenic exposure of man as one of the main tasks of the new Research Council. Collaboration of the industries concerned in a "total industry" Research Council should be possible on this basis.  ESCrO80S0Z __label__Memo

For years,a lot of people have been telling the smoking public not to smoke cigarettes, especially cigarettes with-high ‘tar’ and nicotine.  But the simple fact is that now more Americans are smoking than ever before. Evidently many people like to smoke and will keep on liking to smoke no matter what any one says or how many times they say it.

Inspiratory pressure generation: comparison of subjects with COPD and age-matched normals  SANFORD LEVINE, MICHAEL GILLEN, PHILIP WEISER, GARY FEISS,  MICHAEL GOLDMAN, AND DAVID HENSON  Pulmonary Disease Section, Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104; and Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19129  Levine, SANFORD, MICHAEL GILLEN, PHILIP WEISER, GARY Feiss, MichakL GOLDMAN, AND Davip HENSON. Inspiratory pressure generation: comparison of subjects with COPD and age- matched normals. J. Appl. Physiol. 65(2): 888-899, 1988.—We continuously monitored esophageal (Pes) and gastric (Pga) pressures and used these measurements in a three-component model to estimate instantaneous diaphragmatic (DIA), inspir- atory accessory muscle (IAM), and postexpiratory recoil (PER) pressures at various times during inspiration. We validated our model both by volume-pressure relationships of the respiratory system (Vrc-Pga and Vab-Pga, where Vre and Vab are the rib cage and abdominal volumes, respectively) as well as electro- myography of the respiratory muscles. Measurements were carried out at rest and during graded treadmill exercise in 11 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal subjects (AMNs). AMNs were 59 + 2 (SE) yr and had a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEVio) of 3.6 + 0.2 liters; COPDs were 66 + 2 yr and had a FEV, of 1.0 + 0.1 liters. We noted the following. At rest, both AMNs and COPDs exhibited an increasing DIA pressure (Ppia) across inspiratory time (T1) at rest. As expired minute ventilation increased with exercise intensity, AMNs continued to maintain this Poi, ramp across inspiration; in contrast, COPDs exhibited higher values of Ppra during the first half of Ti than during the second half. At all intensities of exercise, COPDs exhibited higher IAM and PER pressures than the AMNs.  diaphragmatic mechanics; ventilatory muscle fatigue; treadmill exercise  FOR OVER A CENTURY, previous workers have attempted to evaluate the contribution of different respiratory mus-  cle groups to ventilation at rest and during exercise (4). In 1976, Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) studied thor- acoabdominal volume-pressure changes in normal hu- mans and concluded that at rest the diaphragm was the only importantly active inspiratory muscle. During in- creasing intensities of bicycle exercise, they observed thoracoabdominal volume-pressure changes, which they interpreted as reflecting increased activity of the inspir- atory accessory muscles (IAM) and expiratory muscles. Grimby, Goldman, and Mead (9) hypothesized that ex- piratory increases in abdominal pressure represented the storage of elastic and gravitational energy in the chest wall at end expiration; at the beginning of the next inspiration, relaxation of the expiratory muscles would release this energy and thereby facilitate inspiratory  888  airflow.  More recently, Dodd, Brancatisano, and Engel (6) utilized thoracoabdominal volume-pressure measure- ments to evaluate the contributions of various ventila- tory muscle groups to inspiration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) during bicycle exercise. They hypothesized that postexpiratory recoil (PER) of the abdominal wall resulted in rapid diaphrag- matic descent, outward movement of the rib cage, and decompression of thoracic gas, and pointed out that contraction of the abdominal muscles during expiration tended to preserve diaphragmatic length for the initia- tion of the subsequent inspiration. However, neither Grimby et al. (9) nor Dodd et al. (6) attempted to describe the instantaneous pressures generated by the different ventilatory muscle groups throughout inspiration.  Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14) first introduced esophagea! pressure-gastric pressure (Pes-Pga) relation- ships to infer the contributions of the diaphragm (DIA), IAM, and PER to inspiratory muscle pressure generation by a direct graphic method, and showed that this analytic approach was useful in a qualitative assessment of ven- tilatory muscle coordination during breathing under dif- ferent circumstances. Despite the extensive studies of Macklem and co-workers (2, 3, 13, 14), these authors did not attempt to quantitate the instantaneous pressures generated by different ventilatory groups throughout in- spiration.  In the present study, we use a three-component model of inspiratory pressure generation to estimate instanta- neous DIA, IAM, and PER pressures at various times during inspiration. We present these estimates for 11 COPD subjects (COPDs) and 8 age-matched normal subjects (AMNs) during rest and various intensities of treadmill exercise. We include ventilatory muscle elec- tromyograms (EMGs) as well as the relationships be- tween changes in thoracoabdominal displacements and respiratory pressures (9) to validate the conclusions drawn from our model of inspiratory pressure generation.

Standard product testing methodology is judged inappropriate due to the product's unique form and the necessity to maintain Project security. Consequently, new test procedures have been established to assist R&D's development efforts and to assess product, per formance prior to market introduction. These procedures will be validated (and evaluative measures calibrated) utilizing conventional products prior to the first round of SPA product testing. A "traditional" action standard for "blind" product performance cannot be set because of  product uniqueness (form and benefit) and the limitations  imposed by security requirements.  Product development efforts will concentrate on the non-menthol style since capacity constraints will probably preclude simultaneous introduction of a menthol version.  However, to the extent feasible, menthol development will  parallel the non-menthol product.  8699 LOS0S __label__Report

AND FALLACIES" By: Dr. Frank Colby - RJRT  ECTIVE: What we want to convey can almost be summarized in one sentence:  The smoking and health controversy is just that - it_is a controversy.  SIGNIFICANCE AND GENERAL FORMAT OF THE SESSION ON SMOKING AND HEALTH The smoking and health controversy is a very important question;  our Industry has been - and is, of course, trying to provide the answer. If there ever should be any component or components, as found in smoke, that can be proven to be, or contribute to be, a cause of any disease in man, we will of course, take them out.  We will have three presentations on the topic of smoking and health. I will first discuss the scientific and medical aspects of  ' the smoking and health controversy; then Dr. Senkus, who for many  years has been Director of Research of this Company, and who has recently been promoted to Director of Scientific Affairs, will  ex. ,iain how the U. S. tobacco industry, and especially this Company, have responded technologically and in the marketplace to the effects  of this controversy. Then M:. Ed Jacob will review some of the worldwide political  and legal aspects of this controversy, but, because of his experi- ence, he will, of course, discuss mainly the United States.  o8BZ 4200S  ete en Aa ne ty  cee einen oe  ao Aa me a __label__Report

Keane DATE: June 16, 1999  FROM: Matthew N. winoemZ  SUBJECT: 1999 Worldwide Corporate Affairs Conference  Denise,  You asked for topics that WRA might present at the upcoming Worldwide Corporate Affairs Conference in November. These biannual conferences bring together all Corporate Affairs staff at virtually all levels and from all operating companies worldwide. The Conference tries to expose Corporate Affairs staff from the different businesses to each other and to create a sense of common  purpose.  Traditionally, presentations range from the tactical (a proposed PM-USA workplace accommodation plan) to the strategic (emerging issues tracking), attempt to capture activities across all the business units both domestically and internationally and also include some stretch themes, such as how technology will affect the future. A highlight of the 1997 conference was a techno-futurist  from M.LT.  While it would be helpful to know the "theme" for the 1999 conference, my point is that while almost any topic could find a home at past conferences, the more a  presentation could fill more than one bill the better, i.e, worldwide rather than just USA, cutting across businesses rather than tobacco alone, and so forth. My guess would be that the theme of this year's conference will center around the new four strategic directions - alignment, constructive engagement, image and proactive dialogue - in an attempt to cohere all PM Corporate Affairs staff with a  shared vision.  Given past conferences and my assumption for this year's theme, I recommend two potential WRA presentations: New Regulatory Engagement and Courtesy of Choice. Both would “fit" as examples of initiatives the Company is taking that are consistent with the new strategic direction.  1. "New Regulatory Engagement" (working title) would implicitly explain WRA's role in the context of explaining emerging regulatory issues and new approaches to working with the regulatory community. This topic is an outgrowth of your recent 2RF presentation. However, the issue scope should  @  FEGE9ES90 __label__Memo

WINSTON, NASCAR HAVE GROWN TOGETHER  The 1995 season marks the 25th year of involvement in NASCAR for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and its flagship Winston brand. For a quarter of a century, NASCAR and Winston have joined to form one of the most successful marketing ventures in the history of sports sponsorships.  Since RJR and Winston began sponsoring the Winston Cup Series in 1971, the growth of NASCAR racing has been nothing short of sensational.  "We are very excited to be celebrating our Silver Anniversary in NASCAR Winston Cup racing," says T. Wayne Robertson, the president of RJR's Sports Marketing Enterprises. "We believe this program to be one of the finest in any marketing campaign, and we're very proud of the contributions we have been able to make to the sport,” Robertson says. "We thank the competitors for their acceptance of our role in racing and the fans for their continued support of our products."  During those 25 years, the level of competition has skyrocketed. Only a handful of teams were capable of victory during NASCAR's formative years. Today, almost any driver in the field has what it takes to find victory in NASCAR Winston Cup racing. ,  In 1971, Winston established the first point fund for competitors — $100,000. Richard Petty claimed the champion's $40,000 portion at the Plaza Hotel in Daytona Beach, Fla.  The Winston Cup point fund has grown by leaps and bounds in the 25 seasons hence. At the 1995 NASCAR Winston Cup Awards banquet in the Grand Ballroom of the storied Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Winston will distribute $3.5 million — a $500,000 increase over 1994 — to 25 drivers and teams. The substantial increase shows how dedicated Winston is to the great sport of NASCAR Winston Cup racing.  Since its involvement began, Winston has pumped more than $50 million into competitors’ bank accounts — through point funds, special competitions and individual races sponsored by Reynolds Tobacco.  From the 1995 point fund, $1.3 million will go to the Winston Cup champion. For the past two seasons, that champion has been Dale Eamhardt. "The Intimidator," as he is known to many, tied the great Richard Petty's mark last year by claiming his seventh Winston Cup title, a mark many thought never would be equaled. Eamhardt never has won three straight Winston Cup championships, an accomplishment he will be seeking this season.  If a competition can be judged by its champions, Petty's and Eamhardt's presence at the top of the list speaks volumes for Winston Cup racing.  The 1995 season marks the debut of the Winston Select Bonus Program. Through this $200,000 competition, a driver will receive $100,000 for leading the Winston Cup points standings following the Winston Select 500 at Talladega, Ala., in  April and $100,000 for leading the standings following the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis in August.     z9e¢ SO9TS __label__Report

y-  August 17, 1989  To: Distribution  Subject: Nelpmann Qualification Testing  The following are results of requalification testing of the Neipmann Reclaim unit on VANTAGE Charcoal-Japan production. These tests were performed August 3-11 in Dept. 1-1 at #1 Cigarette.  PHASE TIT  All examined phase III cigarette parameters were within prescribed action limits for this product. (Attachment 1)  SPOTTING /STAINING M  Cigarettes were collected from machine #5 using Neipmann processed tobacco and compared with samples from machine #10 (without Neipmann reclaim) for spotting and staining. After approximately four days ageing the control product (Mch.#10) contained 27 spots and the test (Mch.#5) 22 spots. Samples will be evaluated again at 30 days and at 90 days.  CONTAMINATION TESTING/STEVE ANALYSIS  Fifteen random samples of Neipmann processed cutfiller totaling 76.67 pounds were collected for contamination testing and sieves. Rejects with filters containing 8% plasticizer and three center glue lines were used during this sampling. Only one piece of charcoal was found in the total 76.67 pounds sampled. This piece was an entire charcoal plug and therefore would not pose a risk to finished cigarette contamination. This one piece of charcoal compares with totals of 19 and 11 found in similar size samples in prior testing of product without center line adhesive.     In addition to the charcoal there were over 7,600 pieces of paper found in these same samples for an average of 101 pieces per pound. This count is approximately 19% higher than the average paper content in finished shorts. However, the particle size of the paper is visibly smaller than paper found in shorts and therefore is less objectionable.  Sieve analysis of these samples resulted in an average of 27.36% pass the 14 mesh. (Attachment 2)  Samples have also been collected from product using 6% plasticizer and three center glue lines. Results from this analysis should be available by August 23. There are currently 38 pallets or 1140 cases of product with the standard 6% plasticizer filters on quip at CDC. This product will be released by RJRTI R&D pending favorable results from contamination tests. Henry Ebert will schedule a meeting next week with necessary parties to review these results. If results are favorable, RJRTI R&D will approve use of the Neipmann for TI brands.  oO 8 to BH ao co ra ee an __label__Letter

#1240 ~ The Effects of Abminum Silicate in vivo and in vitro - W.S. Lynn Duke University.  This proposal is only a part of the vast program under way financed by various sources including the N.I.E.H.S.  The investigator begins with the thesis that aluminum slicate and organic contaminants bound to it are an important cause of environmentally-induced pulmonary injury. He proposes to study aluminum silicate because it is  an ubiquitous pollutant that avidly bind organic contaminants such as pyrolized hydrocarbons and peroxidized lipids; is pregnt in oats, tobacco, and prepared or processed tobacco products such as cigarettes and many unwashed agricultural products - grains ~ cottons - flax, etc..  With CTR support he expcects to study the following questions:  a) What forms of aluminum silicate and what contaminants bound to it in particles obtained from various sources can be isolated and characterized?  b) Which of these isolated conglomerates injure macrophages, fibroblasts,  and epithelial cells - either killing, producing sublethal inury or depressing funtion?  c) What are the mechanism of this toxicity?  da) Do these isolated conglomerates alter intracellular communication between leucocytes, epithelial cells and fibroblasts?  Briefly his study will be coordinated with others at Duke one of which is concerned with obtaining aluminum silicate from whole tobacco smoke, lungs from smokers and other sources such as grains with the intent of isolating and characterizing the aluminum silicate and organic materials bound to it and compare these materials with the aluminum silicate isolated from other sources. Another investigator will test the prolonged effects in vitro  of the various isolated fractions on macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells and the third collaborator will do in vivo.        I have gone over the who protocol and I am quite sure this group can make  progress in the areas they propose to investigate. However they already  have large sums of money for related studies and will probably pursue these  proposed or related studies anyway. This proposal goes beyond the interests  of the board in the sense that the proposal is a large environmental study - in which tobacco is only one aspect. The budget is large and I predict  would grow as time goes on year by year since three years probably would  not be sufficient to wrap up the objectives in a way that would delineate  the role of tobacco smoking independent of aluminum silicate inhalation from  sources other than tobacco. I would deny this by giving it a rating of 5 Merit as an environmental project: B  Relevance C-  Leon O, Jacobson, M.D.  Che ik for - Sorkin, Watt, Sree, Arba, DS VEC, ar     50216661 __label__Report

x  9/23/91 CC:DRS. FELDMAN, PIERCE ,McALLISTER,CTR STAEF . Grant Application No. 2384A Bi Amason, reviewer, Page 1  Interferons and 2-5A Expression in Alzheimer’s Disease Fibroblasts . Joseph M. Wu, Phd  INVESTIGATOR. Dr. Wu is 44. He did his undergraduate work at McGill, his PhD in biological sciences at Florida State University, graduating in 1975 following which he did a postdoc in Biochemistry at Temple. He has been at New York Medical College since 1978 and a professor in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology since 1987. He reports 72 published papers and lists 9 publications relevant to the proposed work. Also included is a C.V. for Shao-jian An, a research associate from China who has been with Dr. Wu for the past 2 years. He had worked on 2-5A synthetase while still at the Institute of Microbiology in Beijing and has cantinued this work at NY Medical College.  BUDGET, This is a renewal application. Current funding is $80,000 per year and the same amount is requested for the continuation. Dr. Wu will devote 15% effort to this project and requests $15,441 towards his salary. Shao-jian An Is listed for 100% effort and 50% salary recovery is requested for a technician who will maintain the cultured cells and perform routine biochemical procedures. $12,500 is requested for supplies which would appear to be an underestimate of needs, and $4000 for other expenses.  PROPOSAL. In the prior granting period the P.I. has explored differences between control and familial Alzheimer’s disease (AD) fibroblasts with regard to premature senescence and has made the intriguing observation that Type I interferon (IFN)-induced 2-5A synthetase activity is aberrant in familial AD. The enzyme exists in 2 lower mw forms of 40 and 46 kD derived from the same gene by alternative splicing and a 100 kD form probably derived from a different gene. The enzyme acting through 2-5A converts later RNAase L to its active form which then degrades viral and cellular RNA. 2-5A synthetase is believed to be of critical importance in body defense against picornaviruses. In 5 familial AD case fibroblast lines IFN fails to induce the 40 kD 2-5A synthetase and the mRNA is not made suggesting either an aberrancy in synthetase gene promoter or other 5’ exon sequences in familial AD. He has evidence that the 2-5A synthetase gene is hypomethylated in AD cells suggesting an altered DNA structure for certain genes in AD because of an altered methylation state which predisposes to changed genetic transcription and/or processing. The problem does not reside at the level of IFN binding which has been shown to be normal for a. 8, and y-IFN in AD cells. Synthetase in AD cells has an acidic pH optimum whereas in contro! cells activity is maximal at alkaline pH. Presumably this reflects preferential expression of the 46 kD form in AD, the absence of the 40 kD form and a reduced expression of the 100 kD form. Surprisingly, at least to this reviewer, RNAase L activity is reported as increased in AD cells. Based on studies taking advantage of hyperthermia which regulates synthetase mRNA levels by stabilizing mRNA and of phorbol esters which augment IFN-induced synthetase induction of synthetase the P.I. has satisfied himself that a post-transcriptional mechanism is not implicated in the altered expression of synthetase mRNA in AD. Rather he favors differential processing at the 3’ end of the primary transcript which depends on availability of a proximal or a distal polyadenylation site, An alternative would be a different promoter. Based on these data the P.I. hypothesizes that AD is characterized by an altered DNA methylation state and plans to test the effects of methylation modulators such as 5-azacytidine and ethionine on control and AD cells to determine whether control cells can be made to mimic the AD state. He also proposes to characterize proteins that bind to DNA containing CpGg. in control and AD cells in the presence or absence of IFN. Finally he will measure DNA methy] transferase if time permits.  eod ADOTOUNAN-OOVSATIHD MH * WAOvVI eT 1G "£2 ‘Go     CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O. INUS v.

2-May-85  VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL  MEMORANDUM TO: Bill Buckley FROM: Michael Brozek RE: Daily Minnesota Update  sane ene wee ee eee OE ee Oe eee  Bill, as per your instruction, here is a report on our progress with regard to legislative matters in the state of Minnesota. For purposes of order, we will approach this report from the aspects of legislative program and legislative support.  LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM:  As decided on Friday, April 26 in Minneapolis, at a meeting attended by legislative counsels from the Tobacco Institute, R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, which included Dale Florio of Philip Morris and Kent Wold of R. J. Reynolds, specific legislators were assigned to industry lobbyists for direct lobbying contact. This activity is being monitored daily in order to determine any shifts or progress in the Senate Finance Committee and House Appropriations Committee. A meeting will be held on Thursday, May 2 at 2:00 p.m. at the Capitol Rotunda in St. Paul, in an attempt to document legislative responses and comments. These meetings will be held daily until further notice.  Tentatively, the Senate Finance Committee will meet Monday, May 6 at 8:00 a.m., to hear testimony on the Senate version of  the cigarette tax/Health Department package (SF 776). A representative of Covington and Burling, either Mr. Rupp or Mr. Beder, will be on site to offer testimony at this hearing. Additionally, Mr. Vernon Dempsey will be present for direct legislative contact on Friday, May 3 in discussions concerning the sampling issue.  An additional approach has been undertaken to deal directly with the Attorney General's office, concerning a legal opinion to the legislature, regarding the sampling ban portion of SF 776 and HF 810. Legislative counsel Tom Kelm, in meetings with the Justice Department, has requested review of this legislation within the context of the federal preemption. It is understood that these conversations have been, and will continue to be confidential.  CONFIDENTIAL: TIMN 457963 MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION __label__Memo

Cigarette Certification Samples  ~  The cigarettes for the prescribed tests are to be taken =. from 10 cartons. The three experimental cigarettes will be vot taken from 10 cartons out of cold storage, and cigarettes coded «© #872F manufactured October 16, 1962 will be fresh cigarettes. :  ‘Competitive brand cigarettes will be obtained from the 10 jobbers supplying the C. I. Samples, one carton from each obber. These cigarettes already are at the Research Center (oorived this week). - Dr. Seligman informed' me that 20 cartons of new 872F cigarettes will be sent to the Center this week. He does not believe cigarettes coded 854A (new extremely high porosity paper) will be ready this week.  Therefore, we plan to ship the cigarettes to U. S. Testing for the T.P.M., nicotine and total R.T.D. analysis as soon as code 872F arrives at the Center. One pack from each of the ten cartons will be sent to U. S. Testing.  Cigarettes for exit temperature, phenol, furfural, humectant and moisture in filter will be taken from the same 10 carton sample. Where the data is not available, analysis will be carried out at the Research Center. Experimental work will start immediately. It is estimated that all the analyses  “except phenols will be completed by November 9 providing no unforseen delays arise.  hi  S   SOTL9ZTOOT x  ra __label__Memo

Hoyt CC: WDH scS  FROM: Hilda Zahn RCH RFG     sS300-  SUBJECT: x osium on Host Factors in Human Carcinogenesis Cape Sounion, Greece, June 8-11, 1981  N.B. This memo was held up because we were awaiting copies of pictures taken by someone of Hirayama's slides. These prints finally arrived, but not all are in sharp focus. They are reproduced at the end of this memo for whatever information you can de- rive from them. The prints are a bit clearer and are being sent to Marvin Kastenbaum for his pro- fessional perusal.  | \y Assov  The symposium, organized by the International Agency for Re~ search on Cancer in Lyon, France, brought together some 100 sci- SHtists from 19 countries to discuss the difficult question of determining the reasons for individual differences in suscepti-  bility to cancer. The objective is to identify those at higher risk.  Cigarette smoking was mentioned quite frequently, and it was apparent that virtually each scientist present considered smoking to be the single greatest menace to health.  xX Takeshi Hirayama of Tokyo, though asked to speak on the sub- ject of reducing cancer risk by a diet containing daily doses of green-yellow vegetables, spent the first part of his slide pre- sentation on the hazards of cigarette smoking. His talk was garbled and his "slide show" was too rapid, but he was clear enough on two items: (1) some nonsmoking males get lung cancer when their wives are heavy smokers, and (2) smoking is at least as important as diet in the development of stomach cancer. (This information was reported by us in a special memo during the sym- posiun. )  There was no comment at all from the audience on his cigarette data, but a lively debate took place over his vegetable results.  Another recent recruit to the antismoking ranks, >* tricho- poulos of Athens (comauthor of a passive smoking report a few months ago), drew divided opinion with a paper that claimed an association between smoking and liver cancer.     The presentations were lengthy and included reviews of the lit- erature, methodology, the current state of the art, and some in- itial advances that, everyone hoped, will contribute to solving the dilemma of cancer.  - w- Y rs eonard PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL x09 “An sGLIC REL 4 qar3e  and Associates Inc.

Edwards, 199%  27 May 1989 Background Information on the Deuel Conference On Lipids -  The Deuel Conference on Lipids was. organized by a small group of eminent West Coast scientists interested in lipid. research, to provide for the western. states a conference on lipids similar to the Gordon Conferences. Shortly after it’ was organized, one of the founders, Harry Deuel, died. and the conference was named in his memory. The conference has been held annually since about 1955 in various West Coast locations.  Generally the.-conference. is devoted to one or two. subjects and both basic and- clinical materials are presented. The two,.and one-half day conference consists of five sessions beginning Wednes- day or Thursday morning and: running until Friday or Saturday;.. and is held in late. February or .early. March. . Each session is introduced by a speaker chosen for his or her high stature. in the field. These speakers review their own and related work. Each re-  “view is followed by a few small presentations and -general discussion ofa disease process. Informality and wide interchange  of information and views are encouraged by limiting-the size of the. groups, by the round table format, and by not. recording or publish-_ ing the discussions. , Until “1968, - the conferences were organized’ by Dr. L.W. Kinsell, and since that. time they have continued under a broadly. - based rotating leadership.. The original policies. of the conference » have been preserved to keep within the traditional budget, to main- tain the informal atmosphere, and.to provide the depth and breadth — of expertise necessary for a high quality conference.  The attendance has: been kept at less than 100 persons to in-. sure informality. A few established investigators in the field. of lipids, mostly from west of the Continental Divide, are regularly. invited to attend. Lipid scientists in the west are informed. of. the coming program and are invited. to apply for a place around. the table.. The Program Chairman. selects: participants on the basis of . relationship of the research interests of applicants to. the pro- gram. These participants are expected to provide their own travel. and living expenses. All. attendees are expected to be present. for the entire conference. .  The funds to. defray ,the expense of speakers and conference costs are sought from industrial firms which have a general ‘inter- est. in the area of lipids. Donors are extended the privilege of sending a participant(s) to the conference. However, because of . the limited size and the increasing interest in the conference, it. has become necessary recently to adopt the policy of. restricting the participants of the supporting firms to two, with a minimum donation of $1500 per attendee.:  E.L.

- PHILIP MORRIS MANAGEMENT CORP.  TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  Thomas J. Collamore pate:: April 21, 1995 James C. Botticelli  Alan Blum  It is somewhat difficult to give you anything definitive that Blum may bring up at the shareholders meeting, but I'l attempt a stab.  He's rather mercurial in his style, so he really can come up with anything. In the past, he has not been as combative as some of the other anti's (certainly not like the Connolly's, Slade's et al), and tries to come across as a "good" guy, often complimenting PM on its hospitality in Richmond, etc. I find him more an irritant, attempting to embarrass us, than, say, the institutional shareholders, who are pushing for dramatic change. This will be his seventh annual meeting.  He founded the group Doctors Ought to Care (DOC). It's a national physicians’ anti-tobacco group that is especially fond of protesting tobacco-sponsored sporting groups. It targeted Virginia Slims Tournament one year, calling it Emphysema Slims. DOC has been trying to bring in religious allies to its cause.  Blum likes to twist or exaggerate things. He has accused us of suborning the minority community. For example, he said the reason Blacks rarely criticized the tobacco industry on smoking and health issues was because we were “buying them off’ with our charitable contributions. Blum was also the person who, just before the 1992 Republican Convention, released our internal memoranda regarding political contributions. At the time he tried to embarrass us by saying that we are "buying" politicians with our PAC support and that Craig, as Convention Chairman, is further evidence of how we get to politicians. If we support a youth organization, he'll say our ulterior motive is really to get kids to smoke, or, if we sponsor a promotion, he'll say we are really trying to circumvent restrictions on TV advertising.  As far as I can recall, he has never put forward a shareholder resolution, but has seconded or commented on many others. We reviewed the transcripts of the past several years' annual meetings, and he has seconded or commented on the following resolutions - economic conversion (1994), cigarette advertising (1993), global warning labels (1993/91), marketing of Miller beer (1992/91), cigarettes and minors (1990). This year, I suspect he may be interested in Proposal 2 - ETS; maybe 3, primarily because it attempts to get us out of the tobacco business; and 5, economic conversion, since he seconded last year.
