Also, at least three city council members (two plus the mayor) have agreed to rescind the city's ordinances on smoking to make way for whatever the health department decides. Two councilors are undecided. The other four are against allowing the health department enact a smoking ban. The public health commissioner  feels an agreement will be reached between the restaurants and the health department. However, no matter what that agreement is this time, he thinks the town will ban smoking in restaurants and bars in the very near future.  To help defeat the self-service display proposal also before the board,  Bob Stone requests a mailing to retailers to encourage written comments to  the city council and the board,  Solano County, Calif. -- On 8/4, the supervisors will consider a plan to ban smoking outside the entraces of county building.  6S¢ee 98425 __label__Email

DRAFT ~ TARGETING MINORITIES  Some pretty heavy hitters have tried to stamp out smoking: Roman popes, Russian czars, Turkish sultans and English kings. They all failed. Tobacco's popularity with the people has always triumphed over the pressure of the potentates. ° |  Currently, the tobacco antagonists are directing their fire on the alleged "power" of cigarette advertising to "cause" smoking among minorities. They point to billboards in certain neighborhoods and ads in minority newspapers and magazines as evidence that cigarette, companies are "targeting" these groups.  If by "targeting" they mean trying to get a specific group of smokers to switch from Brand X to Brand A, there's nothing immoral, unethical or illegal about it. Wooing and winning over your competitor's customers to your brand is the name of the game in the American free market economy ... whether you're selling automobiles, track shoes, tooth paste or tobacco.  Advertising doesn't cause people to drive, jog,     brush their teeth -- or smoke cigarettes. Take the Soviet Union, for example. Cigarette  advertising has never been allowed. Yet millions of  Russians smoke.  In many countries that have banned or sharply  curtailed cigarette advertising, more adults smoke than  ever before. oe .

Lee!, John L.A. Abrahamson!, Rita Kandel?, Lawrence A. Donehower?, and Alan’  Bernstein!35  ‘Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, and 2Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai Hospital, 600 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, MSG 1X5 3Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronte, Ontario, Canada. MSS IA8 4Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA, 77030.  The p53 tumour suppressor gene is an important participant in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging agents. Cells which lack p53 are unable to arrest cell cycle or enter inte apoptotic cell death following irradiation. Moreover, these p53 deficient cells exhibit an increased resistance to DNA damaging agents, including radiation. The significance of this radiation-resistance and its relationship to the role that p53 plays in tumour suppression and the cellular radiation response has not yet been determined.  In this report we have analyzed p53 deficient mice, -  expressing either a mutant p53 transgene or having a  - targeted p53 null allele, in order te investigate the role  that p53 plays in governing susceptibility to radiation- carcinogenesis and in controlling the in vive accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. We show that wild-type p53 plays a critical role in controlling susceptibility to -y-radiation-induced tumorigenesis, and sarcomas and lymphomas rapidly appear in irradiated p53 transgenic mice. Moreover, this susceptibility to radiation-carcinogenesis is associated with a two-fold increase in the in vivo accumulation of radiation- induced double stranded chromosomal breaks relative to that observed in wild-type animals. Taken together, these observations suggest that p53 acts to suppress tumour formation in vive by preventing the accumulation of cells that have sustained radiation- induced DNA damage. ,     Introduction  The genetic damage caused by both ionizing and non- ionizing radiation plays an important role in neoplastic development. The eukaryotic cellular response to radiation is multi-faceted and involves, in part, a cell cycle arrest at the GI/S or G2/M boundary (Kuerbitx er a/, 1993) and an apoptotic pathway of programmed cell death (Cohen ef al., 1992). The delay in cell cycle progression presumably allows time for the repair of damaged DNA prior to replication or division, while apoptosis may be a mechanism to eliminate genetically damaged cells. Recent evidence has suggested that p53 , which plays an important role in suppressing tumour formation in a wide variety of tissues (Levine et al., 1991; Lane & Benchimol, 1990), is additionally centrally involved in of the cellular response to radiation (Lee ef al., 1994), and in controlling the radiation-induced GI/S cell cycle arrest (Kuerbitx er al, 1993) and apoptosis (Lowe et al., 1993; Clarke ef al.,  1993).     3To whom correspondence should be addressed. Received 19 August _.  1994; Accepted in CRC form on 9 September 1994  Exposure to ionizing (Kastan et al., 1991; Lu and Lane,  1993) or non-ionizing (Lu and Lane, 1993) radiation -  causes an increase in the intracellular levels of p53, most likely due to post-transcriptional stabilization of the p53 protein (Kastan et al., 1991). The p53 protein is a transcription factor (Fields and Jang, 1990; Raycroft er al, 1990; O’ Rourke ef al., 1990, Santhanam ef al., 1991; Ginsberg et a/., 1991; Farmer et al., 1992), and the radiation-induced increase in p53 levels leads to a transcriptional upregulation of the p21¢!P! gene (Dulic et al., 1994). p21C!P! was initially identified as a gene regulated by p53 (El-Deiry e@ al., 1993) and as a protein which interacts with the cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk2 (Harper et al., 1993). The cyclical activation and inactivation of Cdks regulates cell cycle progression (Ohutsubo & Roberts, 1993), and p21C!P! is a potent inhibitor of Cdk 1, 2 and 4 function (Harper et al., 1993). Cdk 2 becomes activated late in G1 and a complex between active Cdk2 and cyclin Eis required for commitment into § phase (Ohtsubo & Roberts, 1993). p53 dependent up- regulation of p21C!P! causes a direct inhibition of cdk 2 activity, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the GUS border. Cells which lack p53 function continue cycling through GI/S after irradiation and halt cell cycle only at G2/M, suggesting that both p53 and p21CF! play necessary roles in a radiation-induced GI/S cell cycle checkpoint  - (Kuerbitx et al., 1992).  In addition to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis is a frequent consequence of the exposure of mammalian cells to +- radiation (Cohen ef al., 1992). p53 can induce apoptosis in a variety of diverse cell types, and also plays a necessary role in a pathway of radiation-induced apoptosis in immature mouse thymocytes (Lowe et al., 1993; Clarke er al., 1993). One of the consequences of the loss of this p53 dependent, radiation-induced pathway of apoptosis is that cells from p53 deficient animals become highly resistant to the killing effects of -y-radiation (Lee and Bernstein, 1993; Lotem and Sachs, 1993). This radio-resistant phenotype associated with loss of p53 function may be one mechanism by which tumours with p53 mutations acquire resistance to radio-therapy and other chemo-therapeutic agents (Lowe ef al., 1993b). ;  The importance of p53 in both tumour suppression and  _ the radiation-response suggests that the two may be  intimately related. The carcinogenic properties of radiation presumably stem from its ability to cause DNA damage. Thus, p53 may suppress tumour formation, in part, by preventing the accumulation of DNA damage. Consistent  with this idea, cultured fibroblasts lacking p53 have .  elevated levels of polyploidy (Harvey et al., 1993) and gene amplification in vitro (Livingstone et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1992). However, the effect that p53 loss has on in  PUBLICATIONS 04570  A  Bae __label__Scientific

Oglesby, Jr.  SUBJECT: Weekly Status Report - Government Relations  Federal Issues  +  Export Reporting  Officials of USDA’s Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) met with various leaf dealers and manufacturers this past week to solicit input on the implementation of the export reporting provisions. RJRT met with FAS last Friday and discussed our ability to  provide the required information within current record-keeping procedures. FAS intends to publish a draft regulation by early April with the possible implementation date of July 1, 1991. USDA officials in Washington have given assurance that the industry is not responsible for maintaining records or providing reports prior to adoption of the final regulation.  State and Local Issues  +  smoking Restrictions  The Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, and Utah legislatures rejected smoking restriction proposals this week. Altogether, bills to ban or restrict smoking in public places have been introduced in 34 states this year, eight of which would affect workplace smoking. In addition to the four states rejecting measures this week, smoking restriction bills were previously defeated in Idaho and Mississippi; no state has enacted restrictions thus far in 1991. Defeating smoking limitations ranks immediately after opposition to cigarette excise taxes on RJRT’s and the industry’s state legislative priority list.  Cigarette Excise Taxes  The Mississippi Senate approved an omnibus tax bill this week after it was amended on the floor to delete a 4c/ cigarette excise tax increase (from 18c/ to 22c/ per pack).

3/14/86 CC: DR. SOMMERS  Application #1916 Applicant: Joan G. Clark, M.D., Assit. Member - Divsion of Clinical Research Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center . University of Washington, Seattle Subject: Collagen Accumulation in Pulmonary Fibrosis  Reviewer: Leon 0. Jacobson, M.D.  She states that the central premise of this proposal is that lung collagen accumulation depends on both collagen productive rate and extracellular deposition of collagen. The experiment planned represent an attempt to identify the factors that influence these pivotol steps in lung collagen acuumulation. Cultured lung fibroblasts will be studied as a model of collagen accumulation. The plan wil . be directed toward characterizing the kinetics of rat lung fibroblast procollagen production, proteolytic processing of procollagen and deposition of  newly synthesized collagen into extracellular matrix. She plans as well to  study the regulation of collagen production and matrixformation and doing so will examine the role of cyclic nucleotides and polyamines::as well as the influence of exogenous substances produced by bronchoalvelor macrophages.  Under specific aims she wishes to answer the question - What is the effects of cell density on the kinetics of fibroblast collagen production and matrix formation regulated and finally how is lung collagen accumulation regulated in vivo.     I think her methods and proceudres are well written. The budget is not out of reasonable range but she doés ask for $10,000 in the first year for permanent equipment.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Beb Ferguson Date: December 8, 1989  rom: Bill Kenry (Vicki Baliga, Project Leader) $0.it/ deen  Subject: Videotapes of Burns of Low Sidestream Cigarettes  Samples of three sets of cigarettes obtained from Gordon Bokelman have been videotaped at a magnification intermediate to those which were used in the pravious videotape. The cigarettes used were:  DODAT Dual-wrapped with 45 g/M’ outer paper having 35% CaCo,, {#9569} 0.4% NH,H,PO,, 0.3% NaCMC, and 5% K,succinate, and. inner paper with 18 g/M? basis weight, 3% CaCO, and  0.6% citrate  D9DAV Single wrapped with high basis weight paper, 68 g/m’, (#9571) with 35% Caco, and 10% KH,PO,  Marlboro Lights 100's as control  For all three cigazette sample. sets, the burning event took place as we had seen before, with a period of char followed by a burn, The burn seemed to move around the circumference of the cigarette in one direction or the other, sometimes changing direction while on the visible side. Visual observation of two cigarettes, placed in the chamber so that both sides could be seen, showed the burn proceeding on one side and then the other alternately in the same direction. This suggested that the burn did, indeed, circle around the full circumference in whichever direction it was moving.  The smoke from the Marlboro cigarette was visible in close proximity. to the rod, and on the images from these tapes the smoke was seen moving upward along the front side of the rod, a few millimeters ahead of the char line (Figure 1). All of the cigarettes in the test showed an area where smoke emanates from the underside of the rod a few millimeters ahead of the char (Figures 1 to 4), but the video image of the low sidestream cigarettes did not always include a plume above the rod (Figure 2). During the taping, a plume of smoke could always be seen: above these cigarettes by visual inspection. Where the video image shows no plume, the smoke. had coalesced to form the plume at a point above and outside of the imaging area of the camera. The visible smoke from the low sidestream cigarettes was considerably less than that produced by the Marlboro cigarettes.  The cigarettes with the single wrapper of heavy-weight paper showed bursts of smoke coming from the rows of perforations along the unburnt portion of the rod, with sometimes startling: visual displays (Figures 3 & 4). Depending on the orientation of the holes with respect to the camera, there was a series of small plumes sometimes from the underside, sometimes from the top, and occasionally they were visible on the front surface of the rod.  9092T9S202% __label__Memo

This is in accordance with similar studies, in which commercial or semi- purified diets were supplemented with 5 to 50 grams cholesterol/ kilogram diet (e. g. Goto et al., 1974, Rosnowska et al., 1978 and Renaud et al., 1979). The. serum cholesterol concentration obtained during the treatment period was markedly increased, but an unequi- vocal correlation between the cumulated cholesterol intake and the cholesterol serum concentration was not observed. In contrary the extent of fatty streaks in part 1 was numerically smaller than in part 2, the serum cholesterol concentration, however, was higher in part 1 than in part 2. This discrepancy shows, that the serum  cholesterol level cannot be used for a prediction of atherogenic lesions in the aorta.  The major parameter for the quantification of atherogenic lesions in this study was the occurence and the extent of fatty streaks in the thoracic (b) and the abdominal aorta of the rabbits. The term fatty streaks is used as a preliminary description of the athero- genic lesions observed. The histopathological description will be obtained after the histological examination of the aorta, which  will be reported separately.

Environmental Tobacco Smoke in Aircraft Cabins: A Scientific Perspective  The U.S. Department of Transportation’s position on the issue of smoking in aircraft cabins is based on scientific principles. In responding to recommendations offered by the National Academy of Sciences in their report on the Airliner Cabin Environment, the Department recognized that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) could be viewed as a problem by some crew and passengers [emphasis added]. They concluded, however, “that further study is needed before the Department can propose a definitive response to [the Academy's} recommendation". The call for further study reflects the simple fact that not enough is known about the concentrations of ETS in cabins and therefore non-smokers’ exposure to ETS. Attitudes bearing on the issue are currently more subjective than objective.  The scientific literature contains but a few reports providing information regarding measurements of ETS in cabins. All these reports share a common feature: . data indicate ETS concentrations to be very low.  In a report to be published in October, 1987 in the American Chemical Society’s periodical, Environmental Science & Technology, Oldaker and Conrad find ETS exposures in no-smoking sections to average 4 thousandths of a "cigarette equivalent"* for an approximate one-hour flight. Additionally, these researchers find that segregation effectively reduces non-smokers’  exposure to ETS. Comparable exposures were reported by Japanese researchers in . .  Historically, findings of low ETS concentrations extend back to the first such reported study which was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health Education and Welfare and Transportation. One notable aspect of this study is that it was conducted before segregation was required. The other is that the segregation requirement ultimately derived not from the results of  the measurements but from responses to questionnaires on passengers’ attitudes  toward smoking.  Experiments have also been performed involving measurements of flight attendants’ bodily fluids in order to estimate exposure to ETS. These experiments can be summarized with the conclusions drawn in the New England Journal of Medicine by one research group representing the San Francisco  General Hospital Medical Center:  the quantity of [nicotine, an indicator of ETS] consumed {equivalent to one cigarette} is relatively small compared with that consumed by cigarette smokers, and the concentrations achieved are unlikely to have physiologic effects.  .*The "smoke equivalent of a cigarette” is calculated from measurements of nicotine and particles, major components of environmental tobacco smoke. Calculation assumes a person breathing at a certain rate and a cigarette delivering a sales-weighted average amount of nicotine and/or tar as reported by the FTC. The cigarette equivalent is an estimate of. exposure and should not be confused with dose (that {s, how much smoke a person breathes and  -l-  9229 62905 __label__Report
PROJECT NUMBER: = 1309  PROJECT TITLE : Cast Leaf Development PROJECT LEADER :  G. Gellatly  PERIOD COVERED : September, 1991  CAST LEAF DEVELOPMENT  A.  Objective: Develop subjectively and physically acceptable reconstituted tobacco sheets for domestic and intemational application using Cast Leaf technology and proprietary binder systems.  Results: Cast Leaf Pilot Plant - The pilot plant is still on schedule for completion by October 11. The grinding area should be operational by December. The latest schedule includes a shipping date of November 8th for the grinder and November 22nd for the cyclone, ductwork and dust collector. The dry ribbon blender and dust feeder will be installed in November so that we can blend dust ground off site.     Operator training in control screen operation and in the BL Plant is complete. The pilot plant and laboratory Job Safe Procedures are also completed.  Cast Leaf Development - Laboratory studies with hand cast sheets have shown that the addition of guar gum binder to prewetted tobacco in the absence of DAP produces stronger sheets. The addition of DAP to the formulation reduces sheet strength. A large particle size guar mixed with the dry tobacco blend was also shown to improve sheet quality. The mechanism of this phenomenon is believed to be a slower guar hydration rate allowing better tobacco hydration to occur. Larger quantities of fine and coarse guar have been ordered for confirmation of this phenomenon in the Cast Leaf Pilot Plant.  A preliminary analysis of 24% recon cigarettes indicated that the DAP content of the recon is a major factor affecting tar and nicotine delivery, puff count, and static bum. The recon used in this analysis included Cast Leaf Laboratory models as well as production RLB, RLTC, and RCB which cover a wide range of sheet density.  Cadiz - Preliminary chemical analysis of the Cadiz trial products in August are satisfactory. The bulk products are expected to be received in USA in October for subjective and survivability assessment.  BL Plant Capacity Increase - The Richmond panel detected differences in BL produced at higher line speeds (330 vs 350 fpm). Modification of the dryer profile moved the subjective response closer to the control however additional trials, planned for October,  are required to qualify the line speed up.  Alternate Sheet Suppliers - LTR - Differences were detected in Marlboro containing LTR sheet substituted for RLTC at a full (6.6%) and half (3.3%) replacement. The findings were reviewed with M. Schulz from PME Leaf. Additional trials are planned at LTR to produce sheet with European feedstocks for evaluation in a Pan European Marlboro.  25  ESEerizzoz __label__Scientific

Departerent. 208 Lite Saences b, The Penasyivania State Cini ersity Unnessity Park, Penmyliarci 10802  Mammalian L-histidine apodecarboxylase (EC 4.11.22). hereafter referred to as histi- dine decarboaylase (HD). is present in most tissues (1). Activation of this system in the micracitculation — produces the delayed. prolonged inflammatory response (2) and Schayer (3-5) has proposed that histamine synthesized by this system in the microcircu- lation constitutes a primary mechani:m of intrinsic microcirculatory regulation. Basic to this premise is his proposal that the princi- pal site of HD is microcirculatory endotheli- um, a premise which to date has not been experimentally verified.  The present studs was undertaken to es- amine the activity of HD in both endutheli- um and in other components of the vascular wall in an attempt to test this basic assump- tion of Schayer's intrinsic microcirculatory control hypothesis.  Methods Animals, All steers were raised on The Pennsylvania State University-owned farms, with sacrifice and tissue removal being performed in the university's Meat’s Laboratory Following sacrifice by stunning, the thoracic aorta of each animal was re- moved. opened longitudinally. and placed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 12 mf clucose (PBS).

MI) in PBS and a magnetic stirring bar. and was brought to and maintained at 37° by means of a constant temperature water bath setting on a magnetic stirrer. Op- timal trypsin washing time was determined by examining aliquots of solution at § min intervals through phase microscopy. The trypsin-PBS solution was changed at 15 min intervals using capillary pipets.  Removal of small thrombi and initial en- duthehal loosening required two, 10 min washings. with both washings being discard- ed. Three additional 15 min washings yielded the majority of free endothelial cells. Subse- quent washings produced only very low num- bers of cells or cell fraements. Cells in each of the three. 15 min washings were collected by first cooling the suspension to 4° to re: duce trypsin activity, followed by centrifuga- tior. for 5 min at 1000g.

TEXAS  SIGNS:  Texas law requires each person who sells tobacco products at retail (including through vending machines) to post a sign in a location that is conspicuous to customers and employees and that is close to the point of purchase, which states:     PURCHASING OR ATTEMPTING TO PURCHASE TOBACCO PRODUCTS BY A MINOR UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW. SALE OR PROVISION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO A MINOR UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW. UPON CONVICTION, A CLASS C MISDEMEANOR, INCLUDING A FINE OF UP TO $500, MAY BE IMPOSED. VIOLATIONS MAY BE REPORTED TO THE TEXAS COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BY CALLING 1-800-345-8647.  The sign must be at least 8’ inches wide and 14 inches long, and the lettering must be in at least 14-point type. For vending machines, the sign must be at least 3 inches wide and 7 inches long, and the lettering must be in at least 10-point type. Signs bearing the required language are available from the Comptroller of Public Accounts free of charge on request. Alternatively, a retailer is permitted to develop its own sign provided the sign meets the requirements described above for size, wording, and type-size. A sample of a proposed alternative sign may be submitted to the Comptroller's office for review. Intentional failure to display the required sign constitutes a Class C misdemeanor. [Tex. Health & Safety Code § 161.084, Tex. Admin. Code §  3.1202]  OTHER:  Pursuant to his authority to adopt mules establishing the minimum requirements for approved seller training programs, the Comptroller of Public Accounts has issued regulations setting forth the requirements that a retailer must meet in order to be certified to provide employers and employees with training in the requirements of state law applicable to the sale of tobacco products. A retailer who wishes to become certified must apply for certification in writing. The application must describe the curriculum, the course objectives, the academic content, the learning activities, any audio-visual materials, written materials, and course evaluation forms. In addition, the curriculum "should" include, at a minimum, instruction in the following areas: (1) “tobacco-related health hazards,” including “statistical information regarding tobacco-related health hazards as published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration"; (2) federal and state law, including statistics on tobacco usage by adults and minors, (3) detection of minors, including "behaviors indicative of adolescence, including current clothing trends and fads, and physical appearance preferences, according to generally recognized experts in the field": (4) personal identification; (5) “second party sales"; and (6) refusing a sale.

April ll, 1986  TO: P. F. Ittermann  RE: Moviegoer — CAMEL Perspective  As requested, the following is Media's perspective on Moviegoer Magazine relevant to CAMEL's continued support/usage in 1987.  BACKGROUND  Moviegoer was developed in 1982 by the 13-30 Corporation for exclusive use by the CAMEL brand. At that time, CAMEL was seeking a property that delivered impactful impressions against better educated 18-34 year old males. Both Brand and Media  management felt that Moviegoer could deliver this audience via high levels of frequency/exposure in selected markets. Attached is the original authorization  request submitted on May 7, 1981, which outlines key brand objectives.  The three major objectives of Moviegoer were: 1) reach portions of CAMEL's target not reached by other magazines, 2) generate Brand association/sponsorship ruboff  and 3) heighten awareness/impact via an uncluttered environment.  A five-year contract (1982-1986) was negotiated at a beginning cost of $5.3MM per year. In 1983, SALEM became a co-advertiser to help offset the impact on CAMEL's budget. Rate increases have averaged 9% per year, and in 1986, the total Corporate commitment will be $7.4MM ($4.8MM Media, $2.6MM Promotions). Circulation has  remained controlled at 1.2MM per year.  NEW PROPOSAL  Moviegoer has offered RJR a new three-year proposal (details attached). Briefly,  the total yearly cost will be $5.6MM net (versus $7.4MM in 1985). Issues will be decreased from 12 to 10, the number of ad pages will be decreased from 60 pages (5  pages x 12 issues) to 52 pages (5 pages x 8 issues and 6 pages x 2 issues). Circulation will increase 46% from 1.2MM to 1.75MM in eight issues (and to 3.0MM or 150% for 2 issues). The number of markets will decrease from 127 to 100 (212%).  CURRENT RESEARCH  During the last five years, several studies have been conducted regarding Moviegoer's  0  4682 8E20S  readers. For purposes of this perspective, we will summarize key research data/findings  from these studies which we feel are relevant to our CAMEL perspective. Research data summarized are from the following sources: MDD's recent readership survey, 13-30's research and movie patron demographics/ findings from industry sources. __label__Letter

. 400 TRESS MESA USERS RY     HPLC DETERMINATION OF ETHYLENETHIOUREA RESIDUES ON TOBACCO  Cc. S. Williard, M. S. Ireland, A. Prakash, and M. A. Sudholt Lorillard Tobacco Company, P. O. Box 21688, Greensboro, NC 27420  Abstract  An HPLC method using UV detection at 240 nm was developed for determining ethylenethiourea (ETU) residues in tobacco. ETU was extracted from tobacco with a solution containing methanol, water, sodium acetate, L-cysteine, and potassium fluoride. Interfering compounds in the tobacco extract were removed using a AEE REO CR Ta TD OM a apa peep Ff 5 i RT ate: > apmaacpespr pr ycoreene zeae bee me nat te CAVED MCHC PETER N ARCH RT FE STENT LEY ea trated, absorbed onto Gaschrom S, and then added to a chromatog- raphy column containing activated alumina. ETU was eluted from the column with 2% methanol in methylene chloride. The eluate was collected in a siliconized round-bottom flask, and water was added to form a two phase mixture. This mixture was concentrated under vacuum until the organic layer had been removed. The remaining portion was diluted to a known volume with water and  analyzed by HPLC.  BATE |:     An ODS Octadecyl column 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 U, was used for the HPLC analysis. The mobile phase consisted of water, methanol (96:4)..at.aflow.rate.of 1.4 mL. per minute... After each analysis, it was necessary to wash the column for 20 minutes with methanol at a flow rate of 2 mL per minute. ETU was monitored at 240 nm.  The recovery of ETU was greater than 80% for tobacco fortified with 0.7 ppm ETU.  OSS8E948 __label__Scientific

rawr.     MEMORANDUM TO: A. Pasheluk FROM: I. J. Staub RE: ' TRUE IMAGE STUDY -- Psychographic Analysis  This memo should serve to further explain the specifics of the psychographic lifestyle clustering we will be utilizing in the image study. It should be noted that this particular analysis is being used here on an experimental basis due to a limited working knowledge of its usefulness in this area (there is little historical data on this subject which can be used for comparison), and because of the relatively small sample size in this study. We are hopeful, though, that the incorporation of the lifestyle clusters can further enhance the analysis and provide additional direction for the agency's purposes.  As you know, the lifestyle clusters are derived from a series of sequential steps beginning with the self-administered list of statements which the respondent rates in terms of how well the statement describes him/her. The particular list we are using in this study is a general one with no smoker-related items and was supplied by an outside expert who has vast experience with psychographics. It is our feeling that this general list is sufficient for our purposes at this time.  The next step in the sequence is the utilization of a factor analysis which will group items that correlate together across the sample of respondents into five or six groupings which we will label as "Quality Consciousness", "Conservatism", "Sociability", etc. Then a cluster analysis is done which groups people that correlate together for their rating of the items or for demographic profiles (such as older/younger).  Assuming that the groupings we get are able to discriminate, the technique will provide us with an additional area of analysis of our potential market - their lifestyle characteristics ~ in addition to demographics.

Tobacco Company Mark Young New York Metra  RI Reyrolle-  January 26, 1998  To: — Charlie DiBenedetto Mark Gambardella Steve Grossberg Lee Maney Greg Mitchell Louann Alese / Marshall Richards  Subject: “VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION” Salem Test Market / Green Zone (Salem: #1 Priority Brand for NY Metro)  Dear Managers,  As we have discussed several times, the importance of getting a “Good Solid” read on the share and volume performance in these small green zones is extremely important to the eventual rollout of the new Salem nationally.  The reason for this is simply the fact that everything that the Green Zone / Green Team is doing in our 12 test zones, is totally workable in the future FDA restricted environment. Think about it, once the advertising goes away, the ground-up approach to introducing a new brand may be the only way! Does it relate to a national introduction plan or is it too expensive ... that is the question that is always asked. If you think about it, the cost of one billboard on the NJ turnpike could totally fund the Green Team activities for possibly a full quarter.  In the next few days, we will be sending you (if you have green zones) the information on manual tracking of purchases in selected green zone stores. This is the only good way to get a read on our business. It will require our SR/TR’s to call on approximately 5 to 7 stores each week to gather sales/purchase data from invoices. Once the stores show that they understand what information we need on a weekly basis, we can then use Retail Representatives and possibly green team members to gather the information on a weekly basis. There is no other way ..... and due to the tremendous importance of this Salem test on a national basis, we need to approach this project with a “Positive Attitude”! As information, the stores that are willing to provide us with copies of invoices will receive a weekly payment of approximately $20 per store.         7).  34" wliy  TL6E@ btacs __label__Letter

ILLINOIS WHOLESALER LETTER #3  October 12, 1993  Gale A. Held, Director  State Prevention Systems Program Center for Substance Abuse Prevention Rockwall II Building, 9th Floor  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville, Marylarid 20857  Dear Ms, Held:  As a wholesaler in Minois, I am very disturbed about the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) proposed rules regarding the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors under Section 1926 of the Public Health Service Act. I would like to take this opportunity to articulate some of my concerns.  As you may know, the Illinois state legislature has already dealt effectively with this issue by attaching criminal, penalties to the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors. Furthermore, retailers, wholesalers and other businesses in the state work very hard to ensure that they comply with the law. I am offended that HHS assumes we have fallen down on the job and has decided to take matters into its own hands (without the consent of Congress) by proposing new, excessive regulations.  How does HHS propose to pay for these regulations? On the backs of small businesses and retailers who already carry a tremendous regulatory burden. HHS estimates that the proposed rules will cost $150 million in compliance law-enforcement costs, As I understand it, HHS suggests that these costs be passed onto retailers in the form of licensing fees, These fees are unfair and could potentially jeopardize the health of Illinois’ struggling small business community.  Finally, 1 strongly disagree with the use of children and "private entities" for law enforcement purposes. How can HHS suggest that young children be used in “sting” operations that have them break the law? It is not only counter-intuitive but it is also dangerous. As for "private entities", I have faith that the law enforcement officials in Illinois can do the job of enforcing the laws. I do not want to put that responsibility in the hands of private vigilantes.  Thank you for taking my comments into account.  Sincerely,  TH 573-2103 __label__Letter

CAN YOU VERIFY that the stock price has more than tripled in the 1990s? ... AND, is there any documentation showing how much the value of investment in PM has grown (eg: in The New York Times this week, there was an article talking about the Dow Jones stocks, how much certain ones are worth now based on investment in them a few years ago).

Considering our data and some literature data as well, we suggest that additional biological evaluation(s)} be conducted ona ciga- rette containing a high level of filler nitrate (e. g.,.added  NaNO3) using WSCs prepared by both IT and ECT procedures. INTRODUCTION |  Interest in nitrate addition to tobacco filler has been stimulated by reports of decreased in vivo activity of WSCs from such cigarettes.! The addition of nitrate to filler has been _ reported to affect both WSC composition and cigarette delivery. Among the effects reported are reductions. in puff count, TPM, nicotine, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) level.2  However, nitrate addition also Teads to large.increases in  the levels of many smoke components: nitroalkanes;3-nitrobenzenes;*  and nitrosamines. The reason for these increases presumably is  that the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced on smoking are reactive with many components in smoke. . . :  rf  ; This NO, reactivity has also been demonstrated to lead to aging artifacts (methyl nitrite) in the gas phase from high nitrate cigarettes.® There is also a report that the observed decreased  catechol level in ECT WSC from high nitrate cigarettes is due to . artifactual formation of 4-nitrocatechol in the cold traps. 7  Other studies of nitrophenols in smoke question the artifactual formation of these compounds. &  The chemical differences described above are differences  WSC from high nitrate cigarettes (X6D3NX) shows different biological.  “a     eTZ9ESL0SZ  Do ra _ inl omens He Mat Heep neteatn ene ene __label__Memo

As you know, the SP-A gene is expressed in a lung-specific manner, SP-A mRNA transcripts are detected primarily in type II pneumonocytes and to a lesser extent in nonciliated bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara) cells. We have found in studies using transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA flanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A  gene targets reporter gene expression only in lung, and specifically to type II and Clara cells. In consideration of the cell-specific nature of SP-A promoter activity, this genomic construct  should be most useful in targeting Cre recombinase to the same cell types in the lung that also express gp330.  I read your grant proposal with great interest and believe that your studies using loxP/Cre recombinanse-mediated gene targeting for creating cell-specific inactivation of 2p330 will yield important information regarding the role of this protein in lung cell biology.  Sincerely,  CG RM ideban —_  Carole R. Mendelson  5323 Harry Hines Boulevard / Dallas, Texas 75235-9038 / 214’648-2944/ FAX 214/648-8856. __label__Letter

NEW YORK POST New York, New York April 28, 1964  CONSUMER SWINDLES—vit       “Stop smoking in only three days, No will power or self control necessary. Proved effective beyond a question in 100 pér cent of smokers tested.  “Don't confuse this offer with plans, systems, books, methods, ete., for these remedies require that you have enough: self-control. to stop smok- ing.”  All you do, the ad says, fs take one “Formula X22" pill following each meal. After only: three days, your nervous system is “fooled” into be- Heving you are smoking your favorite. cigaret, cigar or pipe.  This sort of promotion has been mushrooming all over the U. S. since the Surgeon. General's re- port on smoking and cancer was released early in 1964. Since. January, Better Business Bureaus throughout the ‘country have been flooded with inquiries about dozens of “new” anti-smoking pills and lozenges, mouthwashes and chewing gums, stop-smoking plans and programs costing up to $40 and more for “the cure.”  Fanciful claims by manufacturers. for their products and programs include “miracle ingredi- ents” supposed to be “99 per cent effective’ and to “force you to quit whether you want to or not.” New commercial “tobacco guidance centers” with lofty-sounding names have sprung up from coast to coast—only a few of. them under competent medical supervision,  * * *  Millions of us are paying millions of dollars for products we hope will rid us painlessly of the cigaret habit.  We are gulping sugar pills and concoctions of ordinary spice such as ginger, Heorice, clove, cori- ander—as well as pharmaceutical preparations— to stamp out the cigaret craving.  We are. taking up fake cigarets—dubbed “smokes” or “adult pacifiers’ which contain such non-nicotinie ingredients as metho} srystals,     cabbage, lettuce or just flavored cigaret paper— to keep our nervous hands busy and permit us to “smoke without fear.”  We are falling for suggestive “stop smoking” phonograph records, recently the subject. of in- vestigation by the U.S. Post Office.  : We are enrolling in a wide variety of so-called “positive thinking” programs, even hypnosis, to spirit us away fromi tobacco. We are devouring no-smoke tablets. and how-to-stop-smoking pam-  phlets. % x *  Just what is the value of these pills and pro- motions? What can and can't they do? From the National Better Business Bureau’s Dr. Irving Ladimer, here are a few straight answers:  Despite the welter of new labels, there are no really “pew” substances on the market te help us stop smoking. Old ones simply have heen dressed up or combined to appear new,  The three standard types of anti-smoking medications now available are the nicotine sub- stitute (lobeline sulfate), which alleviates cigaret craving; substances which make smoking taste unpleasant (silver nitrate), and local anesthetics (benzocaine) which numb the mouth and reduce desire for.the puffing part of the smoking ritual.  Many- of these products do, in fact, help you .  quit smoking temporarily. But none does the job permanently. None works without a generous dose of will power on your part. Most are harm less, but a few cases of nausea, stomach -pain and loss of appetitite have been reported as. side- effects.  In conclusion, the American Medical Assn. |  states: “It is possible that some individuals amen: able to psychological suggestion would find anti- tobacco preparations to be an ald. However, ex- cessive smoking is a psychiatric problem and must be treated as such if the individual is unable to rid Eimself of the nabit voluntarily.”  Tomorrow: Health Quackery.  2  Evpszoszo __label__News

APPENDIX VII APPENDIX VII  Fd o % UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 5 é WASHINGTON, D.C. 20460  OCT 23 1981  OFFICE OF POLICY AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  Mr. Henry Eschwege  Director Community and Economic Development Division  U.S. General Accounting Office Washington, D.C. 20548  Dear Mr. Eschwege:  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the General Accounting Office (GAO) draft report entitled "Regulations of Cancer-Causing Food Additives -- Is It Time  for a Change?"  The report discusses the Delaney Clause of the 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of cancer-causing food additives. According to the draft report, food safety experts believe the Delaney Clause should be changed because of its inflexibility; however, they disagree on alternative regulations to the present statute.  The GAO report also points out that the requirements of the Delaney Clause are inconsistent with the statutes mandating the approaches used by EPA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For this reason and also because of advances in scientific methodology, uncertainties about the human risks from low-level carcinogens and the inflexibility that exists under the Delaney Clause, GAO recommends that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.  ‘EPA concurs with the general findings and conclusions that GAO has reached in its analysis. EPA also concurs that these findings provide a sound basis for GAO's recommendation that Congress reexamine the Delaney Clause.  78  VCLO 9960S __label__Letter

So  Today the Senate Finance Committee conducted its third and final day of hearings on revenue options. The hearing was chaired for most of the time by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) ; Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) attended for just a short period of time. Other Senators in attendance included Thomas Daschle (D-SD), Donald Riegle (D-MI), Daniel Moynihan (D-NY), Bill Bradley (D-NJ), and John Chafee (R-RI). The witness list and selected testimony are attached.     Highlights include:  ° Rudy Oswald, Director, Economic Research Department, AFL-CIO, opposed any new or expanded sales, excise, or other consumption taxes. "It is our strong belief that any new revenues be raised on the basis of ability to pay," Oswald said, adding, "regressive taxes are contrary to the goal of tax justice and intent of Congress in enacting the 1986 reforms." Oswald encouraged the Committee "to focus its attention on the individual and corporate income tax and the  estate and gift tax."  oO Paul Huard, Vice President, Taxation and Fiscal Policy, National Association of Manufacturers, opposed any changes to individual or corporate taxes or selectively imposed excise taxes. "We oppose without exception any change that would increase federal revenues derived from selectively-imposed excise taxes," he said. Huard characterized excise taxes as "undeniably regressive." He added, "If Congress is determined to raise additional federal tax revenues, it should only be done by imposing a consumption-type tax at a uniform rate on the broadest possible base of taxable goods  and services."

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. CONFIDENTIAL  INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  To: Melissa Jeltema Date: May 19, 1994 From: Kimberly Singh «No , Subject: Project Case Compilation of "Filter Material" Responses  The panel was composed of ten employees, five females and five males. Three of the women were given the paper filter, while two received plastic filters. The reverse was given to the men. The test took place on Thursday, May 12 and on Friday, May 13. We did not originally plan for two days but due to “technical difficulties", the filters for the superslim cigarettes were not ready until Friday. Therefore, those smokers participated on that day, while all the other smokers performed the test on Thursday. One filter was given to each person and they were instructed to use this filter for the  day and if for some reason they needed another one, they could receive a new one.  The responses that we received from the one-on-one interviews have been compiled below.  The overwhelming response for the open-ended question of “comments/problems/issues" was the functionality of the filter. With the exception of one person, all respondents experienced difficulty in fitting the filter on the cigarette. Other comments were: the RTD was decreased; the filter made the cigarette too strong; the idea of putting a filter on each cigarette before smoking is a "pain", the filter made it difficult to light the cigarette; and, the filter made the circumference of the cigarette larger than what is accustomed to  being felt while smoking.  As far as the "preferred" material, four participants out of the five that used the plastic filter would prefer that type of material verses the paper. The female that did not choose the plastic did not like the "slick" feel of the material. Another reason was that the cigarette could possibly slip out of the mouth if not being held tightly with your lips. The others said the feel of the plastic was pleasing. They also liked the sturdiness or firmness of the plastic, and the lip release was good. This question was only asked to the plastic  filter users.  The paper filter users did not mention any particular thing that they liked about it, but also did not mention any dislikes, with the exception of one person that said the filter  became "grubby" by handling it so much.  Each person used the original filter given to them for the entire day, with the exception of one paper user. The amount of cigarettes smoked during the day, for each participant, ranged from 5 to 40. The person that requested a new filter used the first one for 8 cigarettes and the second paper filter was used for 11 cigarettes.  BS  DOC CODE: P0621     O8S8686 TS0e __label__Memo

He does not expect any end-of-session tax surprises; session scheduled to adjourn 2nd week of May, however, legislature might extend for ten days to complete work on tort reform and subsistence program.  - Provided Citizens for Tax Justice and Coalition Against Regressive Taxation materials to T.I. counsel Jerome Anderson, in preparation for June special session.  - Arranged for meeting in D.C. with Sen. J.D. Lynch, and Repr. Dan Harrington (House Taxation Comm./Asst. Dem. Ldr.) with RLM, at request of Jerome Anderson - T.I1. counsel.  - Eugene, OR: meetings held with Mark W. Perrin, atty.; re: sampling ordinance. Perrin has meeting scheduled with city Atty for 5/5/86.  Attempts to re-generate coalition formed several years ago, during Eugene public smoking ordinance debates, not meeting with success. Local vendors not supportive of sampling programs; restaurateurs don't want sampling; not yet getting sympathetic response from C of C.  WASHINGTON: ~  - Contacted David Figuracion; Tacoma, WA; re: press reports about his potential suit challenging SB 4519. He was working with an attorney on a "volunteer" basis, but now that he finds he has to actually file suit challenging emergency clause vs filing of referendum, atty is not available (atty works in County Prosecutor's office).  Told him, as instructed, that we could have our attorney's share research on SB 4519 with his attorney(s). He has spoken with several people who have expressed support; they will probably help him raise $70 filing fee; he'll explore finding an attorney and get back to us. He has own computer software firm he operates from his home-not unusual in Puget Sound area.  TNWL 0002042 __label__Report

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  ne  Richmond, Virginia  To: B. Handy Date: November 1, 1989  From: N. Jensen Wey’  Subject: Mass Spectral Analysis of Residue from ART Pilot Plant  GC-MS analysis was performed on a sample of residue obtained from the reactor at the ART pilot plant. This sample was originally submitted by Jose Nepomuceno, request code 289095, sample code Z9DS. The sample was taken up in hexane and analyzed by GC-MS using the JEOL SX 102 mass spectrometer. A 15 meter, DB-5, 0.25 um column was used with conditions of initial temperature 100°C, heating rate of 10°/min., and final temperature of 325°C with a ten minute hold time. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode (EI) with 70 eV ionization potential, 10 Kev acceleration and a scan speed of 1 scan/sec over the mass range 0-800.  Figure 1 shows the total ion chromatogram for the sample. Important components include: hexane solvent (scan 67), neophytadiene (scan 516), (18,2E,4R, 7E,11E) -2,7,11-cembratriene-4, 6-diol (scan 746) and a number of long-chained hydrocarbons in the region of 950-1300. Although most of the components in the region of scan 950-1300 are long-chained hydrocarbon waxes, there are two notable exceptions. The first is the component observed at scan 1158 which has a structure that likely contains a substructure with aromatic character and an aliphatic chain. The second is the component observed at scan 1205 which appears to have a cholestane type structure. Absolute identification of these compounds has not been acheived.  Comparison of this material to ART materials analyzed previously reveals no components unique to this residue (see memo: Mass Spectral Analyses of ART Samples to D. Leyden, from N. Jensen 9/22/89). If one compares this material to solid material obtained as residue from higher pressure ART runs, the major difference is in relative distribution of various components. For this residue sample, the abundances of neophytadiene, the cembratrienediol and the cholestane type compound are increased with respect to the abundances of the hydrocarbons as compared to ART solid material analyzed previously. There are also some differences in relative distribution within the hydrocarbon region.  The total ion chromatogram for the sample is attached and mass spectra have been obtained for all components indicated in the TIC.

CYTOVOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES SPECIFIC FOR SELF TUMOR IMMUNOGLOBULIN EXPRESS T CELL RECEPTOR 6 CHAIN  By ANN WRIGHT, JEFFREY E. LEE,’ MICHAEL P. LINK, STEPHEN D. SMITH, WILLIAM CARROLL,! RONALD LEVY,! CAROL CLAYBERGER, anp ALAN M. KRENSKY  From the Departments of Pediatrics, *Surgery, and tMedicine, - Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305  One goal of cancer research is to exploit the exquisite specificity of immune recog- nition to eliminate tumors in vivo. Although their role in immune surveillance of  tumor cells remains unclear, CTL are possible candidates for adoptive immunotherapy. The effectiveness of this therapy depends on CTL recognition of specific tumar an- tigen. Ig on B cell lymphomas is an ideal tumor-specific antigen since it has a vari- able region (idiotype) that is tumor specific (1, 2). We report here that human CTL specific for the idiotype on autologous B cell tumors could be selectively expanded in vitro. The phenotype of these CTL is CD3*,CD4°,CD8~ and they express the  § chain of the TCR. Such CTL could be grown in vitro for the treatment of B cell lymphoma.  Materials and Methods  Celi Lines. ‘Tamor cell lines were established as described (3) fram the primary tumors of three patients with Burkit’s lymphoma. The SUP-B8 cell line was derived from tumor isolated from the bone marrow of a 15-yr-old female with Burkit’s lymphoma with extensive bone marrow involvement (B cell ALL). The patient achieved a complete remission after treatment with chemotherapy but suffered an isolated central nervous system relapse. She received an autologous bone marrow transplant, depleted of malignant cells with anti-B1 mAb, following preparation with total body irradiation and high dose cyclophosphamide. Reeur- rent B cell acute lymphoblastic leukernia was documented 5 wk after uansplanc, and 9 mo after initial diagnosis. Peripheral blood was obtained from the patient at the time of leukemic relapse. The SUP-B12 ccll line was derived from tumor isolated from a 7-yr-old male with Burkitt's lymphoma with extensive bone marrow involvement (B cel! ALL). He was treated with intensive chemotherapy and complete remission was documented ¢ wk after the start of treatment. He received intensive maintenance chemotherapy, which was electively discon- tinued 18 mo later. He remains in continuous complete remission. PBL were obtained from this patient both during and after chemotherapy while in remission. ‘The SUP-BI17 cell line was derived from the malignant ascites fluid from a 3 and 3/12-yr-old male who presented with a primary Burkitt's lymphoma in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were normal and he was designated stage III, Com- plete remission was obtained with chemotherapy, which was electively discontinued after 15  This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant CA-34233, fellowship AI-07290 fram  the ‘Lraining Program in Immunology (to A.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: 25 September, 1987  From: Barbro Goodman  Subject: CIGARETTES. FOR ANALYTICAL SIDESTREAM RESEARCH  Based on discussions between Chemical Research, Analytical Research, and Cigarette Technology personnel, several cigarette models were designed specifically for research on sidestream smoke composition. The objective for the upcoming studies is to investigate the efifect of cigarette circumference and Mg (OH) 2 wrapper. In order to provide a matrix for the analyses, prototypes were made at three different circumferences (17 mm, 20 mm and 24.8 mm) each with a standard commercial wrapper (Kimberly-Clark 156) and with a 12% Mg(OH)2 wrapper. All the cigarettes were made from the same batch of tobacco in a nondiluted 100 mm filtered configuration.  The selected blend was the current project TRIM blend with standard production components. DBC Bright, DBC Burley, MT Oriental, RLTC and RL 150B was used. It contained no stems or expanded tobaccos, so that better looking ultra slim cigarettes could be produced. All samples had the same casing and aftercut system.  The Hauni lab: max was: used for all three circumferences. Cellulose acetate filters were made with widely varying efficiencies in an effort to keep the mainstream tar deliveries within reasonable levels. The tables attached to this memo give analytical data for each of the models. As can be seen in Table I, the 17 mm configuration gave extremely high RTDs for nonventilated cigarettes. This could have an efffect on mainstream puffing to a greater extent than for a standard circumference cigarette. Ultra slim prototypes. typically have RTD’s above 6" water for 45. - 55% filter ventilation. The variability of the RTD was also greater for the slim cigarettes.  Tables II and III give the calculated diffferences in data for each circumference with the commercial and the low sidestream wrappers at standard circumference as controls.  2c0e  C87-@3852  aEStst __label__Memo
REVIEW ARTICLES     MECHANISMS OF DISEASE  Franxun H, Epstern, M.D., Editor     THE PATHOGENESIS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND TILE ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES  (First of Two Parts)  VaLeNnTIN Fuster, M.D., Pu.D., Lina Bapimon, Pu.D., Jean J. Bapaaon, Pu.D., AND James H. Crrserro, M.D,  [ the 19th century there were two major hypoth- eses to explain the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis: the “incrustation” hypothesis and the “lipid” hypoth- esis. The incrustation hypathesis of von Rokitansky,! proposed in 1852 and modified by Duguid,” suggested that intimal thickening resulted from fibrin deposi- lion, with subsequent organization by fibroblasts and secondary lipid accumulation. The lipid hypothesis, proposed by Virchow* in 1856, suggested that lipid in the arterial wall represented a transduction of blood lipid, which subsequently formed complexes with acid mucopolysaccharides; lipid accumulated in arterial walls because mechanisms of lipid deposition pre- dominated over those of removal. The two hypotheses arc now integrated into a more camplex “response-Lo- injury” hypothesis, developed by Ross,* which repre- sents the prevalent view of the initiation of athero- sclerosis.     Vascucar Injury anp CORONARY ATHEROGENESIS  Vascular injury and thrombus formation are key events in the origin and progression of atherosclerosis and in the pathogenesis of the acute coronary syn- dromes. We have proposed a pathophysiologic classi- fication of vascular injury or damage that divides it into three types (representing stages of increasing se- verity), in order ta understand the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases and formulate therapeutic strategies (Fig. t).? Type I consists of functional alter- ations of endothelial cells without substantial mor- phologic changes; ‘l'ype I], endothelial denudation and intimal damage with intact internal elastic lam- ina; and Type II], endothelial denudation with dam- age to both the intima and media,  In spontaneous atherosclerosis, the tenet is that chronic musimal injury to the arterial endothelium is caused mainly bya disturbance in the pattern of blood  From the Cardiac Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston (VF, LG.

I. NICOTINE OXIDATION BY CELL-FREE PREPARATIONS*  L. I. Hocusreint ano Sypney C. Rrrrenpero  1 ee ee From the Department of Bacteriology, Univeraity of Southern California, Los Angeles, California  (Received for publication, August 18, 1958)  Various pathways have been postulated for nicotine degrads,- tion involving an initis] attack at either the pyridine or the pyrrolidine rings. ‘The evidence for the suggested pathways has been provided mainly by the isolation of a variety of compounds from bacterial growth media (1, 2), tobacco seed infusions (3), fermented tobacco leaves (4), and the urine of animals that previously had been fed nicotine (5, 6). Unfortunately, because of the complexity of these systems it is not certain whether the isolated products are directly or indirectly derived from nicotine, nor is the sequence of their appearance clearly established. In an effort to avoid the difficulties inherent in the use of complex systems, studies of nicotine metabolisth were attempted st the enzyme level employing crude and fractionated extracts derived  from a bacterium. EXPERIMENTAL  The organism (designated as strain P-34) employed is a gram- negative rod isolated from soil by enrichment culture techniques. It is capable of using nicotine as its sole source of carbon and energy but ite growth is stimulated by yeast extract. It wag grown in a medium having the following composition in grams per 100 ml.: 3.33 K,HPO,.3Hy0, 0.4 KH:PO,, 0.1 (NH,)3S0,, 0.1 yeast extract, 0.4 nicotine, and the following trace salts; 0.01 MgSO.-7H,0, 0.002 CaCi,-2H.0, 0.004 MnSO,-4H,0, 0.0002 FeSO,.7H:0. The trace salts were dissolved in 0.1 N HCI at 100 times the fina! medium concentration, autoclaved, and added aseptically to the medium in the required amounts.  For the preparation of lange batches of cells, growth was car- ried out in 12-liter round bottom flasks containing 7 liters of mediuro. The inoculated medium was aerated with sterile air and incubated at room temperature. After the culture reached the maximum stationary phase (approximately 60 hours), the cells were harvested in a Sharples centrifuge. The unwashed cell paste was stored at -18° until needed. Yields were of the order of 6.5 gin. wet weight of cells per liter of medium.  Cell-free extracts were prepared according to the method of Mcliwain (7) by grinding a mixture of 10 gm. of partially thawed cells and 25 gm. of levigated alumina in 8 cold mortar. After grinding for 10 to 14 minutes at room temperature, the cell- alumina mixture became “tacky.” The resulting paste was extracted with 30 ml. of 0.01 m potassiam phosphate buffer, pH 7, for 15 minutes at room temperature and for 45 minutes at  * This work was supported by a grant from the Tobacco In- dustry Research Committee. Preliminary results were presented to the Society of American Bacteriologists, May 1957.  t Present address, Department of Medical Microbiology, Uni- versity of Southern California School of Medicine.  4°. The alumina, unbroken cells, and cell debrie were removed by centrifugation at 18000 x g for 60 minutes at 4°. The re- sulting clear yellow supernatant fluid constituted the crude ex- tract and contained, on the average, 22 mg. of protein per ml.  Ammonium gulfate fractionation of the crude extract was carried out at room temperature by the addition of the hequired amount of solid ammonium sulfate (8). After the addition of the ammonium sulfate, the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 4° for 10 minutes at 18000 x g. The super- natant solution was decanted, the pellet drained by inversion and dissolved in 0.01 »¢ potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7; to give & final volume of approximately one-fourth that of the starting crude extract. All ensymatic fractions were stored at —15° if not used immediately.  Ultraviolet absorption spectra were determined with a Beck- man model DU spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures were prepared for spectrophotometry by adding them to 2 volumes of 0.1 ~s HCl, removing the precipitated protein by centrifugation, and, if required, diluting the clear supernatant solution with additional 0.1 x HCI.  Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were determined by conventional manometric techniques (10).  Reaction mixtures were chromatographed on Whatman No. 1 paper by the ascending technique. The solvent was an 85:5:30 mixture of n-butanol, bensene, and 0.2 a1 sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6 (11). The alkaloids were located by exposing the dried chromatograms to cyanogen bromide vapors for 1 hour followed by spraying with #-naphthylamine (a Koenig's reaction), by ultraviolet absorption under a Mineralite lamp, or by treating  the paper with Dragendorff’s reagent.'  Oxidation of Nicotine by Crude Extracts Crude extracts pre- pared from several independently grown batches of cells usually oxidized nicotine at a slow but definite rate. The amount of oxygen consumed varied from extract to extract and in many cases no oxidation was observed. Furthermore, fresh extracts which oxidised nicotine lost this ability upon storage at ~ 18°,  : Prepared by mixing & parts of solution A (0.85 gm. of bismuth subnitrate, 40 ml. of distilled water, and 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid) with 5 parte of solution B (8 gm. of potassium iodide in 20 ml. of distilled water), and adding 20 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 100 ml. of distilled water.  151  PUBLICATIONS  034276 __label__Scientific

In contrast, in-store coupon activity for the Price Value category is substantially higher, with 42% of volume sold accompanied by an on-carton/on-pack coupon. Practically all of Philip Morris’ couponed volume is via on-carton/on-pack coupons, and is obviously tied to support behind Cambridge and Alpine. While 32% of RJR’s total volume sold in the supermarket and drug store universe is with a coupon incentive, only 12% of the manufacturer’s sales was via an on-carton/on-pack coupon. The majority of RUR’s coupon activity (accounting for 20% of volume) is delivered through direct mail, FSI and ROP. RJR’s reliance on FSI’s, Direct Mail and ROP couponing is further emphasized by the fact that the manufacturer accounted for over 40% of total industry media-delivered  activity during 1989.  cUPae  O9229 __label__Memo
vee ee ee ee ee re meee cent oe oe nee ete | 4  Siate of Immunity And Personality  Tied to Cancer  Medical Tribune Report CAREFREE, ArRIz,.—The role of the emo- tional state in association with malignant disease has recently been sharpened to an extent that enables a delineation of the “cancer-prone personality.”  And what ultimately makes him sus- ceptible to cancer may be a psychologi- cally triggered alteration in his immune defense.  Both views, and some supporting ex- periments, were reported here at the 13th annual Science Writers Seminar of the American Cancer Society.  The personality sketch was described by Claus Bahnson, Ph.D., senior research scientist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psy- chiatric Institute in Philadelphia, who for more than 10 years has been testing and interviewing hundreds of cancer patients for comparison with normal persons and, more recently, with coronary patients and  Medical Tribune May 5, 1971  patients with a variety of other somatic diseases.  In general, he said, the cancer patient represses all unpleasant “affect states,” such as anxiety, depression, hostility, or guilt, much more effectively than nor- mals or other sick persons do. As might be deduced from that, the cancer pa- tient feels the least stress in his job, re- cent stress of any kind, or psychic anxiety and is furthest from the “pat- tern A” associated with myocardial in- farction (competitive, restless, anxiety- laden).  From childhood the typical cancer pa- tient recalls a life that was “bleak and un- satisfying,” remembering mother as un- loving and unprotecting and father as un- protecting and undemanding. The upshot is a person who conforms to social norms, living “a formal, realistic, and common- sense—oriented effective social and family life unrelated to his basic needs for affec- tion, warmth, and personal creativity.”  “The cancer patient is a nice guy,” Dr. Bahnson said, and has great difficulty deal- ing with or expressing anger.  Subjected to statistical analysis, the “projection score” data on cancer patients compared with normals and patients with other ills indicated the cancer patients’ re- pression of emotions was significantly greater than normals for all indices and greater than that of any other patient in all indices except guilt, where there was no meaningful difference between cancer, coronary, and other sick patients.  Dr. Bahnson said he currently is work- ing with cancer specialists and immunolo- gists in an effort to pin down a relationship between affect and stress states and im- mune reactions in cancer patients com- pared with normals. As it stands now, -he said, on a purely empiric basis it should be possible to screen psychologically a ran- dom group of people and accomplish a 30 per cent improvement in forecasting which members of the group are most likely to develop cancer.

PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE     120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017  TO: Distribution : DATE January 15, 1986 FROM: Marketing Services at aw Ey  & “3 dats. yoL SUBJECT: CONCORD'S PROMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE .  In order to create trade and consumer excitement about the introduction of Concord, PM USA came up with two interesting promotions:  For Trade:  To introduce customers to this new product, key accounts were given portable stereo cassettes which contained a tape featuring the Concord message. (The stereo cassette was theirs to keep.) The volume on the cassette was pre-set at the highest level possible. Introductory music was the first sound you heard, followed by the text. The text began by informing the listener that the announcer knew what the listener had just done -- he adjusted the sound to the tone that was comfortable for his easy listening. The announcer then informed the listener that he could also adjust his tar level from 5 mg. to 15 mg. per cigarette, depending on his mood. The announcer invited the listener to try a free sample of the Concord cigarettes which were enclosed with the cassette recorder and tape. A copy of the Concord Regular and Concord Menthol texts are attached for your review.  For Consumers:  Besides the usual, free samples, two-~for-one deals (lighter free) and carton give-aways (Concord Solar Calculators), Concord offered a sweepstakes whereby consumers automatically entered into the drawing  when they redeemed their coupons. Top prize consisted of a Ford  Mustang, a Hawaiian Cruise or $15,000 cash. Coupons were inserted  in magazines, newspapers and supplements. When a consumer rubbed off  the top right portion of the game card insert, he was entitled to a  free pack or carton of Concord. When he redeemed the game card for his prize, he wrote his name and address on the bottom of the card, as well as marked off the prize he wished to be eligible to win. The coupon  was then automatically entered into the "Suit Your Taste" Sweepstakes. (Copies of the coupon and free samples are attached for your information.  Should you be interested in a dial-a-tar introduction, you may like to adapt the above ideas.  eet  Patricia Sabatino,  BQ Wr oS Net Attachments ~J NO pa Oy __label__Memo

New Entrants and NPMs  Activity to Date MSA provisions to level the playing field. 35 states have passed MSA Exhibit T legislation which includes escrow payments, volume adjustment, and NPM adjustment.  Ongoing meetings with state AGs to identify the problem and solutions, and with FTC to urge them to find labeling not in compliance.  Gaps and Weaknesses States will have difficulty distinguishing NPM product.  States may have difficulty collecting escrow monies. 15 states have not yet passed Exhibit T legislation. The 4 previously settling states (FL, TX, MS, MN) have lit(le incentive to pass it.  Indians are sovereign nations. It is unclear what, if anything, we or government officials can do, other than monitoring for possible violations of state and federal regulations.  What Can be Done Finalize passage of MSA enabling legislation in remaining 11 MSA states and 4 non-MSA states.  Industry must constantly remind AG's of neccessity 10 enforce NPM provisions (letters, mectings)  Set up a quarterly Working Group which could include Original and Subsequent Manufacturers, ATF, trade groups (NACS, NWMA, etc), and others (NAAG, state revenue e.g.). The Working Group will assist in:  - reporting regulatory violations, gray market activity  - enforcement of escrow payments and other MSA provisions,  - analysis of other possible solutions.  Participating Manufacturers and retailers must establish a system for reporting the existence of Non- Participating Manufacturers’ product to state authorities to assist the states in collecting escrow  payments.  Push for state licensing of imported cigarettes. License would become tool for collecting NPM escrow payments.  Q9SOe 9EbcS __label__Report
Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors in Men With Light and Dark Skin in Puerto Rico  Raut Costas. Jk.. MD, Manio R. GARCtA-PALMIERI, MD. Paut Sorvie. MS. AND ELLEN HERTZMARK. MA  a a  Abstract: The association of skin coler with coro- nary heart disease risk factors was studied in 4,000 wre ban Puerto Rican men. Skin color on the inner upper arm was classified according to the von Luschan color tiles. Using this grading, men were separated into two groups of light or dark skin color. The dark group had a lower socioeconomic status (SES) based on income. education, and occupation. Dark men hac slightly higher mean systolic blood pressures (SBP) and lower  mean serum cholestero! levels than the light, but the relative weights and cigarette smoking habits of both groups were similar. After controlling for the dif- ferences in SES, skin color showed a small but statisti- cally significant association with SBP. Whether this association with skin color represents genetic or envi- ronmental! influences on SBP could not be determined from this study. (Am J Public Health 1981, 71:614-  619.)  A  Introduction  Differences in mean blood pressure values between Blacks and Whires in the continental United States have been observed in various studies.’ * Investigations have centered on ascribing the higher blood pressure values in Blacks to the effect of psychosocial processes or genetic:  environmental interactions. “*  High blocd pressure is recognized as one of the more potent factors for the development of coronary heart dis- ease. It is related to and possibly interacts with other risk factors to accelerate the development of this disease. This multiple potential for illness. disability, and death makes the clarification of the etiology of the higher blood pressure in Blacks of prime importance. particularly tn view of the long- term public health goal. the primary prevention of hyper- tension.  tn an attempt to gather data relevant to this question. skin color was determined for subjects of the Puerto Rico Heart Health Program. a prospective siudy of the epidemiol- ogy of coronary heart disease. In addition to blood pressure. various other factors studied in relation to skin color were relative weight. physical activity. serum cholesterol. fasting serum triglycerides. blood glucose. and measures of income. education. and occupation.

This paper, submitted to the Jovtnal Sepicinber 4. 1980. was revised and accepted for publication November 28, 1980.  614  Ethnic Background of Puerto Rico  The people of Puerto Rico are descended, in order of their appearance on the island, from Taino Indians, Span- iards. West Africans, and non-Spanish Europeans.’ The In- dians, never a large number to begin with (estimated at 30,000 to 50.000),8 were decimated by the Spaniards in vari- ous uprisings, so that by the year 1787 only 2,302 survivors were reported in the census.” Racial admixture between Spaniards and Indians had occurred early and frequently. In the year 1530, of 71 women legally married to Spaniards in San Juan. 14 were Indians.” |  The social integration of West Africans in Puerto Rico differs from that in mainland United States. Spanish culture was impregnated with Catholic religious values. The church, an important influence in early Puerto Rican history, never sanctioned the chattel status of the Blacks nor did it segre- gate them.’ Considerable intermarriage took place frum earliest times.’ Mulatto children would frequently inhent land from their White fathers, thus becoming landowners and improving their economic situation. Pure Blacks, how- ever, had to work for very low wages after slavery was offi- cially abolished in 1873.  Since 1873 there has been legal’? and political’? equality for Blacks in Puerto Rico. However, census data between 1899 and 1980 reveal a general historic pattern of drastic un- derrepresentation of Blacks in occupations related to social and economic improvement and social prestige.'* This pat- tern was related to the influx into Puerto Rico of American capital.? A study conducted by a special committee of the Commonwealth House of Representatives as late as 1964'* showed discrimination against Blacks in the employee selec: tian system for Puerto Rican banks. In 1989, the Puerto Ri- can Senate’* found discriminatory hiring practices for pri- vate school teachers. Al the present time a casual visit to any  AJPH Juno 1981, Vol. 79, No. @ __label__Scientific

PHILIP  TO: FROM:  SUBJECT:  BRI 7 1 30 IF EICE Ce NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592 William I. Campbell DATE: September 2, 1992 David E.R. Dangoor BEN &H SP. Ne RA  Looking back at the media stir created by the Wall Street Journal article, Thursday, August 13, 1992, I think our Corporate Affairs Department did an excellent job with “damage control" (please see enclosed summary of events from Karen Daragan and summary of Jim Oates’ conversation with Smart Elliott of the New York Times).  The issue has died down and to the best of our knowledge, very little awareness was created associating the B&H Special Kings brand name with the story and the reporting got fairer with time.  However, the Wall Street Journal article was very unfortunate and "unfair"...  Ironically, although we committed only $9,200 for two issues of Genre (total of two ads) out of a total media budget of well over $35 mio (!), we had long discussions up the line including myself and Jack Nelson concerning the wisdom of approving Leo Burnett's recommendation to make this media buy. But, we decided it was the right thing to do.  Two unforeseen circumstances played a role: The day before the Wall Street Journal called, we had just granted an exclusive interview and story on the B&H Special Kings launch to Stuart Elliott of the New York Times (he held back the Story as a result of the WSJ article and only ran it last week). Hence, we did not give the story to the WSJ, but only responded to their questions.  Secondly, either the actual publication or someone else, drew the WSJ attention to our media buy. It is not the first time that the WSJ marketing section prides themselves with “tabloid reporting sensationalism". Why they chose this angle for the story is strange, as it was well know that Absolut Vodka and Miller had advertised in this publication for some time.  It continues to be challenging to take measured risks when trying to create impact for the advertising of our cigarettes.  fra | _  ce: K. Daragan V. Han 7 S. LeVan M.A. Miles E. Merlo R.W. Murray J.

It takes teamwork to prevent cigarette sales to minors.  Preventing cigarette sales to minors is not a job anyone can do alone. We all have a role to play in this effort—-parents, teachers, store owners, state and local officials and, of course, tobacco companies.  At Philip Morris USA, we're teaming up with retailers, wholesalers and other major tobacco manufacturers in support of an ambitious program. called “We Card.” It is providing stores across the country with signs and educational materials to promote awareness of minimum-age laws and the importance of checking ID.  We're also supporting the passage of state legislation to better enforce existing minimum-age laws.  What can you do to help? Become familiar with your state’s minimum-age laws. Don’t buy  cigarettes for minors. And don’t send minors to buy cigarettes for you. Teamwork can make the difference.  wii a) 2501030007 PHILIP MORRIS U.  Action Against Access. __label__Advertisement

Giles Manager, Analytical Research Period Covered: July I, 1980 through September 30, 1980 Re: QUARTERLY SECTION RESEARCH REPORT  No. of Pages: 6  |. CIGARETTE BEETLE CONTROL. Project 7131 (Personnel: Bellin, Hutchens, Brooks)  -  Due to a mild winter and an unusually long hot summer, cigarette beetle counts for the season have been excessively high. A total of 4,475,800  beetles has been trapped to date. This is the largest number of insects trapped since the summer of 1976, a season which required a large number  of fumigations following a mild winter. Forty-four shed fumigations have been completed this quarter. Twenty-two of these have been at Davie County storage. This is 85% of the Davie sheds which contain tobacco. Rapid buildup of insect populations has necessitated fumigating in two locations  at the same time. This is the first time in the history of the insect control program that this has been necessary.  The insecticidal fogging schedule at Davie has been increased to six  nights each week. All other locations are being fogged every other night (three times each week).  A sample of each DDVP mix has been analyzed by Mr. David Heavner. Concentrations of DDVP in the mixes ranged from 9.5%-13.3%. The correct concentration is 9.3%. The meter-which measures kerosene was found to be  in error and has been replaced with a new one. Analysis of the latest mix, using the new meter has not been completed.  Counts from factory traps are up to date. The increased number of beetles in the traps from the receiving areas indicates that insects are betng brought into the factories from the high infestations in the sheds. This could lead to higher customer complaints due to insects.  Application of Kabat R +o tobacco at the Brook Cove stemmery has been completed. A total of 93.5 gallons of Kabat R was used to treat 3,318,192 pounds of stems (9.24 ppm) and 95.5 gallons used to treat 3,232,223 pounds of strips (9.69 ppm). The calculated rate of application was 10 ppm. The cost of the chemical to treat this tobacco was $22,680.  The stems are stored in cardboard boxes and the leaf in poly-wrapped Tersa bales. The tobacco is stored in Shed 435 at Brook Cove. The shed is not being fogged nor will it be fumigated. Insect counts will be monitored  “closely and temperature and humidity measurements taken weekly during the test period. The insect count in the shed to date is 4,263.  NN  ghL9 LZE0S __label__Report

Additional models will be made to evaluate expansion of De-Nic filler by NET and inclusion of the NET at 20 and 35% rates.  Project Half-Nic: Filler for POL’s 05022 and 05024 (with and without calcium hydroxide) is scheduled to be re-made in Semi-Works the week of February 17. The new ship dates for these POL’s are the weeks of March 16 and 23.  PACKAGING STATUS:  A meeting was held to discuss "film barrier testing" with Quality Engineering and ARD personnel. Szu-Sung Yang and Jay Pierotti presented the glassware apparatus designed for this  test and explained the "purge & trap"/GC method used. Further work is needed to determine if precise quantitative results can be achieved with this test method.  Preliminary analytical testing methods for use in the "Gravure Solvent Migration Study” have begun using the standard PM headspace method.  Residual solvent levels were determined on sixteen samples. U.S. Bronze, a bronze and aluminum paste supplier, was on site to develop strategies for producing low odor aluminum paste. Several test materials will be supplied for analytical  and subjective evaluation. U.S. Bronze supplied the aluminum paste for the B&H KS packs.  An aging study is being conducted for Quality Engineering which is examining a smaller application pattern of pre-applied adhesive for Project Gold.  GOSSTLLG0G __label__Memo

Molecular characterization of the signal for radiation-inducible genes and the isolation of novel radiation-inducible genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae:  Michael Fasullo, Ph.D. Loyola University  Specific Aims:  Damage-inducible (DIN) genes have been cloned and characterized from many organisims, including yeast, bacteria, and man. Many of these genes are induced by a variety of DNA damaging agents that inflict a diverse spectrum of DNA lesions, including base pair damage, cross-links, bulky adducts, and singie- and double-strand breaks. These DNA damaging agents include chemicals that cause oxidative damage via the formation of free radicals, similar to those found in tobacco smoke. The diversity of DNA lesions caused by free radicals provokes the question of whether all these lesions can serve as the primary signal for damage-induction or whether these lesions are processed to a common signal that triggers the induction of DIN genes. The aim of this project is to focus specifically at ionizing radiation as an agent that induces DIN genes in yeast, to elucidate the genetic pathway by which a single double-strand break may serve as a signal for the induction of such genes, and to isolate novel radiation-inducible genes that may be triggered directly by the presence of DNA double-strand breaks. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been chosen for these experiments becuase many genes involved in the repair of radiation damage are well defined and the molecular biology and genetics to address the phenotypes of mutated genes is well advanced. In addition, roughly 1% of the yeast genome is speculated to encode damage-inducible genes (Ruby and Szostak, 1985), only a few yeast genes have been characterized as damage-inducible, and previous attempts to isolate DIN genes have not utilized ionizing radiation as the DNA damaging agent-  Significance:  Human genes that are induced by ionizing radiation include TNFa, p53 , protein kinase C, IL-1, collagenase and yadd45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). These and other characterized genes represent a subset of a theoretically much larger set of genes (for review see Fornace, 1992). Although the functional significance of the DIN genes has yet to be explained, recent evidence has found that failure to induce gadd45 is correlated with radiosensitivity in patients afflicted with Ataxia telangiectasia, and such patients have a higher incidence of cancer, especially lymphomas. The induction of these genes by ionizing radiation and free radicals may occur by a variety of signal transducing mechanisms. Oxidative damage to membranes may trigger the expression of protein kinase C which phophorylates transcription factors, such as jun, that in turn induce the expression of such genes (Hallahan et al., 1991), although this may not be the mechanism of the induction of gadd45. Alternatively, DNA damage may be the primary signal for the induction of damage- inducible genes. This is suggested by the observation that cell lines that are defective in damage repair have higher levels of the expression of particular damage-inducible genes (Herrlich et al., 1992). Nonetheless, the signal transduction mechanism which is provoked by a DNA lesion is poorly understood.  Elucidation of the pathway by which radiation-induced DNA lesions directly stimulate DIN genes may be better addressed in yeast. This proposal is divided into the following sections. First, elucidation of the mechanism by which a single double-strand break can  l  50628622 __label__Scientific

By the end of two weeks this mean score had dropped to 5.16 (5= neither like nor dislike). The attribute ratings identified problems with strength, odor and performance that could be correlated to decline in acceptance. Some subjects did comment on their impression that they felt better during the period they were  smoking the product. , . :  Background  There were three groups of Human Study subjects who completed periodic evaluations of their perceptions of the product during the periods when they were smoking the test product . The evaluations included the measurement of Overall Acceptance and 16 attributes related to performance, usage, flavor, strength, and odor (ballot is attached). The subjects also provided written comments. The 31 subjects who ‘ evaluated the test product for two weeks, completed three evaluations (Groups S1 and $2). The twelve subjects who evaluated the product for 39 days, completed five evaluations(S3 Group). The data were analyzed for all subjects of Groups Si, S2 and S3 for three intervals. The subjects in Group S3 who provided five evaluations were also analyzed separately. The results of the first two intervals have been reported  previously.  Results of Three Intervals for All Subjects  Test conditions varied for the three groups of subjects. The Si and S2 Groups were both on the diet but smoked the product during different two week periods. Males and females were represented in both groups. The $3 Group was not on the diet and smoked the product for 39 days. The S3 Group was comprised of males only. The results were analyzed for group and interval effects. Group effects were not a major source of information.  The three interval] results indicate that 12 of the 16 attributes and Overall Acceptance were significantly different across time. The changes exhibited by these attributes were viewed in one of: two ways. First, as a movement in the score that would represent a change in __label__Letter

Estimated attendance is 10,000. Although the show will be taped for a later airing date, there is no problem with our participation. We  did the same type of event here in Houston in June to benefit the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and it was very successful.  RECOMMENDATION  I am recommending participation in this event.  RATIONALE  Participation in this event will provide the Camel Brand with extensive exposure in Corpus Christi's Hispanic market in a relatively slow promotional period. In addition, participation in this event will provide the brand with  an opportunity to:  Sample our target market  Distribute our premiums  Display our banners and inflatables  Set up our Camel Video Van - show our videos Include our logo in print publicity  eH eH  This will also provide us with a good event for this market which has not been to active in promotional events.

Surge PhD Associate Research Scientist University of Michigan Medical School  What are the biological air soljutante that pose risks to public health?  Biological air pollutants or “bicaerosols" are particles or vapors in the air that are derived from living organiams. Microscopic organisms such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi (mold) become airborne, as well as toxic and allergenic compounds produced by their growth in the environment. In addition, higher organiama such as cockroaches, dust mites, cats, dogs, birds, etc. shed allergens into the air. are common  Ww e i i 2  Biological air pollutants cause infections, allergies, and toxic diseases. Some of these are listed below:  Organism Source th seace  Virus Humans : Influenza : Measles Chicken pox Some colds Bacteria Humans Tuberculosis Water reservoirs Legionnaires’ disease Water reservoirs Humidifier fever Heating systems "Farmera’ lung disease”  (hypersensitivity pneumonia) odors, discomfort  Fungi Damp materials Aspergillosis (infection) “Farmers’ lung: disease” Asthma  “hay fever*  Acute toxic disease Cancer  edors, discomfort  Sick building syndrome?  The infectious diseases result when a living microorganism invades and grows in human tissue. The airborne viral diseases (all of which are infectious) are transmitted through the air from one person to another. Most of the airborne viral diseases affect anyone who has not already had the disease, including normal healthy children and adultes. They are familiar and need not be reviewed here. Tuberculosis is a familiar lung disease that, as with viruses, ia tranemitted through the air when infected patients cough, sing, or even talk. The organisms does not grow in environmental reservoirs such as cooling towers or humidifiers. Normal healthy people require large doses of the causative bacterium before infection occurs. Tuberculosis is a re-emerging problem because there are increasing numbers of patienta with impaired immunity (including AIDS patients) who are highly susceptible to the disease.

MaJor histocompatibility complex class IJ molecules and their peptide ligands show unusual interaction kinetics, with slow associ- ation and dissociation rates that yield an apparent equilibrium constant of ~10 *-107° M (refs 1-5). However, there is evidence for a specific, rapidly formed, short-lived complex’. The altered migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of class II molecules upon stable peptide binding’ has led to the hypothesis that the two kinetically distinguishable types of class Il-peptide complexes correspond to different structures.

There was a linear correlation between the number of fast-farming comptexes and the concentration of sDR1 used for incubation {S.S.N., unpublished observations}, which indicates that labelled HA 306-318 binds to sDR1 and not to blocking proteins or other components of the assay system. For measurement of dissociation rates, peptide and sDR1 were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and passed through a spun column at room temperature. The excluded volume was collected, counted, and incubated for the first indicated dissociation time. It was then reapplied to a spun column and the excluded volume recovered and counted. This process was repeated to generate the data for the entire set of dissociation times. Native gel electrophoresis was per- formed using Mini-PROTEAN II Ready Gels from BioRad as described’. Dried gels were autoradiographed.  50701941 __label__Scientific

I am convinced from our work that a low antioxidant level in semen is a major risk factor for damage to sperm DNA and consequent birth defects and childhood cancer in offspring. Since smoking is a very efficient way to lower antioxidant levels, I expect that smoking will primarily damage sperm DNA through that mechanism. Our review of the epidemiology appears to bear this out. I enclose our Pittsburgh paper, where we make this case. We will continue this work to make the case as strong as we can. If smoking is only working through lowering antioxidants then supplementation with antioxidants should reverse all of the deleterious effects on the next generation. I think this is extremely important to know and I am committed to finding it out. ,  If you wish to collaborate with us by collecting sperm samples from smokers and non-smokers in your company that would be very useful in speeding up the study as it is hard for us to find smokers locally. If you wish to add in a group of smokers of your presumptive safe cigarette to compare to regular smokers and non-smokers, we would be agreeable to that. That might benefit you and would not be much extra work for us. If you are interested in this type of collaboration and would agree to unimpeded publication of the results, however they came out, we would be enthusiastic about going ahead. We would finance our end and you would do the same on your end. We believe that this is work that will have a major impact on health and that it is extremely important to do as soon as possible.  Your letter was quite convincing that the government is not subsidizing tobacco farmers.  Tee \ Ze  Bruce N.

(CTR), is pleased to award you a renewal grant in the amount of $80,000, including indirect costs, for the period from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997 for the proposed study: “Regulation of Cell Stress Signaling by a New Antioxidant Protein." It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional authorities. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with submissions to other agencies. If the latter result in awards, we should be notified promptly so that we can negotiate an appropriate adjustment of our award.  The award is made without guarantee of support beyond December 31, 1997, even though we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that date. Therefore, if by May 31, 1997, you submit to us a formal non-competing renewal application, including a report of your progress, your request will receive consideration.  Please review the enclosed "Important Procedural Information for Grantees." Please fill in the attached "Notice of Research Project" and return it to me. Contact Drs. Harmon McAllister or George Hashim of our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant and keep us informed about the progress of your study.  The enclosed statement of “Financial Requirements” indicates that the Council recovers unexpended annual balances over $1,000 and that year end deficits cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Moreover, our failure to receive timely financial statements from your grants office will stop further payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this will obviate any possible misunderstandings.  Sincerely, y ee  James F.

Fredenck Cancer Research and Development Center, Fredenck. Maryland 21702102717 T BLUR]  Abstract  Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Fps leads to the rapid transcriptional activation of the Egr-1 gene, which encodes a mitogen-responsive transcription factor. Activation of Egr-1 by v-Fps was insensitive to protein kinase C depletion, suggesting that a protein kinase C-independent signal activated by v-Fps leads to the induction of Egr-1. Expression of v- Fps in transient expression assays induced Egs-1 promoter activation. v-HaRas and v-Rai also atsivated the Egr- 1 promoter: To characterize HaRas and Raf- 1 involvement in v-Fps-induced Egs-1 expression, we used recently characterized dominant negative mutants of HaRas and Raf-1. v-Fps-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was inhibited by the dominant negative mutants of both HaRas and Raf-1. v-HaRas-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was blocked by the negative Raf-1 mutant; however, v-Raf-1-induced Egr-1 promoter activation was unaffected by the inhibitory HaRas mutant. These data suggest that v-Fps activates a protein kinase C-independent intracellular signaling pathway that is dependent on both HaRas and Raf-1, where Rai-1 functions downstream of HaRas.

Convention Center. For your consideration I've enclosed a preliminary schedule of events and associated costs. There is not a registration fee for the CBC weekend Issue Forums and Braintrusts, however,  registration is required.  Issue Forums are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday at the Washington Convention Center. The Braintrusts will be held on Friday in committee rooms on Capito) Hill.  Fashion show, two shows, Friday, 8 p.m., and Saturday {2 noon. This year’s theme: A Return to OZ. After Friday’s fashion show there will be a benefit concert featuring either Chaka Kahn or Gladys Knight.  The keynote speaker fur Saturday aight’s awards dinner has yet to be decided. Bernard  Shaw of CNN will serve as the Master of Ceremonies and entertainment will be provided by the O'Jays and Levert.  I realize that attending the CBC weekend is quite an expensive proposition considering airfare and housing costs. However, I would like to encourage as many of you who can afford to attend to do so. The Braintrust and the Issues Forums are usually very thought provoking. The social events are usually very nice, but trying to attend all of them could cost you an arm and a leg. So use your own judgement.  On Friday cvcning Congresswoman Meek will host a complimentary reception on the roof top terrace of the Madison Building of the Library of Congress for her friends from Miami.  ~more-  omit On RAEVELED TIFL 0024812 __label__Letter

Letters to the Editor  On Ulcer Therapy  Sir: I read the article on ‘“Contro- versies-in Ulcer Therapy” (MWN, June 23) with interest.  Some years ago, I discarded the’  theory of hyperacidity as a total  ‘ cause for the presence of the benign  duodenal or gastric ulcer, and decided that the Sippy diet was inadequate.  Benign duodenal or gastric ulcer is     a multifaceted disorder involving not only hyperacidity but hypermotility, infection, allergy, and local endarte- ritis obliterans. Although I am a sur- geon, I recognize that adequate medi- eal therapy for the benign ulcer must include eradication of any or all of the above factors in order to satisfac- torily rectify the disease.  ‘The Sippy diet was discarded by me because it not only did not clear all the symptoms but left the patient weak and unhappy. With the treat- ment that I followed [which begins with placing the patient on a milk-, wheat-, and egg-free diet] not only was relief frequently obtained, but there was an absence of the monot- ony of a milk and cream diet. Often  dramatic symptoms of well-being ©  were encountered, particularly if [an allergy to} milk was [causing the disorder]... .  MILTON W. WHITE, M.D. Detroit  Sir: I have just read with interest the article “Controversies in Ulcer Ther-  12  F1EqICSi VVC CWE em  apy.” There are many ideas put forth about medication, diet, and rest, but I was greatly disappointed that no one mentioned anything about the effect of cigarette smoking on peptic ulcers.  I have been in general practice for 41 years in the western part of Cin- cinnati, and although I have not kept the kind of statistics that research people do, I have come to some very firm conclusions about the relation- ship of smoking to ulcers.  In fact, I have had many patients come to me with recurrent ulcers— having been treated by other doctors without success—who healed their ul- cers within a few weeks when the abolition of smoking was added to their daily routines. I have also had many other patients who did not stop smoking and who had recurrences, al- though they stayed on a diet and [took] antacids.  As a result of this experience, for the past 20 years I have refused to treat all ulcer patients unless they  ‘ would promise to stop smoking per-  manently. FOSTER M. WILLIAMS, M.D. Cincinnati  Sir: “Controversies in Uleer Therapy” interested me very much in that at this late hour in medical history con- troversy should exist on the subject.  Certainly there is a consensus that if you can maintain neutralization of the gastric acidity and establish con- comitant normal digestion through- out the gut, you are going to heal the ulcer—providing the area has not been so cicatrized [that] normal arte- rial, venous, and lymphatic movement to [it has been completely cut off].  When this has occurred, a gastro- plasty or duodenoplasty would appear to be entirely proper.  But a vagotomy at qny time sug- gests .. . surgical-medical incompe- tence in the fields of diet, psychothe- rapy, and physiology.  ERNEST J. CARLSON, D.O. Denver  Sudden Loss of Hair Pigment  Sir: The article “White from Fright— or Lack of Henna?” (mwN, June 23)  RTS tied  Pi) "© HKa0074158  brings to mind my critical evaluation of the subject 40 years ago in Hand- book der Haut und Geschlechtsk- rankheiten, (Vol. 4, Part II, 1011- 1221), edited by J. Jadassohn and published by Julius Springer Verlag in 1988. The article I wrote for that / collection was titled ‘Pathological  Pigmentation of the Skin (and Hair)  in Internal Medicine, Neurology, and  Psychiatry.”  Gradual graying of the hair is fe netically determined. But there’ is abundant evidence that canitieg, or premature depigmentation of /air, can result from continued severe stress. However, as [your article re-- porting the views of] Dr. Joseph E. Jelinek. correctly states, sudden whi-  tening of hair—e.g., overnight or in a |  day—is still disputed as it was 40 years ago, largely because it is Very        complete, one partial, of relatively rapid development in young soldiers in World War I. To be exact, eannot be accepted as cases nities subita sive acutissima because the individuals were not seen imme- diately before and after the occur- rence. This requirement is seldom ful- filled.  The effect of disorders of the ner- vous system (especially the sympa~ thetic), as well as metabolic and endo- crine disturbances, on skin and hair are well established but rarely come to the attention of the dermatologist. Aside from their diagnostic signifi- eance and scientific interest, abnor- malities of the pigment do not cause any therapeutic stir.  _ It may be for this reason that the questions of the formation of air or gas bubbles [in the hair shaft, produc- ing a white appearance] has not been settled, which one would expect, con- sidering the advanced technology of electron microscopy. I have seen un- der the microscope (at a magnifica- tion of x 1600) the disintegration of the medullary area of the shaft of a diseased whitened hair, while the cor- tex was relatively intact. .

TRUDY GALLANT: Two years ago the Surgeon General challenged the American public to achieve a smoke free society by the year 2000. The American Medical Association has accepted the challenge by proposing a total ban on all tobacco advertisements and they support a bill currently in the U.S. Congress to do just that. It may turn out to be one of the most heated regulatory debates of the year. Should we ban all tobacco advertisements? That's our question tonight on Both Sides Now.  NARRATOR: Live from the studios of Channel 56, Both Sides Now with Beth Conrad.  GALLANT: Good evening. I'm Trudy Gallant filling in for the vacationing Beth Conrad. In 1971, cigarette ads were banned from television. Now there is a movement to go even further, a total ban on tobacco advertisements from billboards and magazines to matchbook covers. It would also prevent tobacco manufacturers from sponsoring athletic and artistic events. Dr. Bruce Dubin is the spokesman for the American Lung Association of Southeastern Michigan and a lung disease specialists. He believes that smoking is the number one preventable health problem in America today and the advertising industry ought to be stopped from portraying smoking as an acceptable social habit.  Scott Stapf is an assistant to the president of the TOBACCO INSTITUTE in Washington, D.C. He says that such a proposal would get a dangerous precedent toward curbing commercial free speech. He also says there's not a shred of evidence that cigarette advertising encourages people to smoke. So welcome  gentlemen to Both Sides Now. . Dr. Dubin why should we ban cigarette advertising?  DR. BRUCE DUBIN: Very simply for this reason. Cigarette smoking is the number preventable, very important word,  TIFL 0520178  OFFICES IN: NEW YORK » DETROIT + LOS ANGELES » WASHINGTON, D.

SAB Summary Review 10/98  Acquisition of Source Signatures and Receptor Modeling of Fine Particles and VOC Impacting Indoor Air Quality in Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo, Brazil  Antonio H. Miguel University of California Riverside, CA  Brief Description  The investigator proposes to test the hypotheses that, (a) the net transport of fine particles and volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) indoors from outdoor air accounts for a significant fraction of the indoor aersol in Santiago de Chile and Sao Paulo and, (b) that city-specific profiles of major outdoor and indoor sources plus simultaneous measurements of chemical markers outdoors and indoors can be used to apportion the major sources of VOC's and PM 2.5. Work involves identifying and measuring city-specific source tracers in PM 2.5 and VOC’s, measuring the tracers in outdoor and indoor air simultaneously and applying/developing a chemical mass balance receptor-based air quality model to apportion outdoor air and indoor air source contributions to indoor air quality. Ambient air measurements indoors and outdoors will be made once in the morning and once in the afternoon at four restaurant locations and four office locations divided equally as being near heavy traffic and near a “park-like” setting in each city (metropolitan area). Two additional outdoor measurements will be made on the sidewalk near and away form traffic to provide supplementary exposure data, The inclusion of four residences in each city is proposed as an option. Up to fifty constituents/tracers will be measured to include metals, acids, Total VOC’s, individual VOC’s, and selected source-specific tracers. A highlighted component of this work is the construction and deployment of an “advanced” (source-term/residence-time) sampling system to acquire the samples.  The CIAR is requested to fund the indoor air component of this work. Outdoor air work will be performed by collaborating institutions in Chile and Brazil using their own resources except for the sampling system. Two systems will be constructed using CLAR support and one will be provided to the collaborators along with training in its use.  Strengths and Weaknesses - _  The opportunity to acquire source-apportionment data and estimates of exposure in South American countries is important for comparison with the extensive U.S. and European database. The essentially no-cost participation of local collaborators expert in outdoor air quality is a strength of the proposal. The principal investigators (and his host institutions) expertise in fuels and energy-related source contributions is a further strength. The principal weakness is an inadequate description/justification of many aspects of the study. It is not clear, for example,  96cePrL9L02 __label__Scientific
Mortality Data: How Reliable? How Accurate?  For many years, the U.S. and other countries have compiled "vital statistics" to monitor and study the health Status of their populations. Included in these vital statis- tics are numbers of deaths, usually. .classified by cause. Such mortality data can be useful in identifying and evaluating trends in specific diseases, in setting health research priorities, and, by way of epidemiological studies, in sug- gesting factors that may be associated with certain diseases. It is obvious that for valid conclusions to be drawn from these types of statistical studies, mortality data must have a  high degree of reliability.  Sources of Mortality Data: Death Certificates  Mortality data generally come from death certificates. AS a result, scientists and statisticians have been concerned with the quality of this source of information. Some comments from the medical and scientific literature!~4 indicate the  depth of concern:  It has become obvious that in many cases the diagnosis on a death certificate may have  actually no bearing whatsoever or any rela- 7) tion to the cause of death of a given patient.  Disquiet exists about the accuracy of the diagnostic information contained in the  medical certificate of cause of death even in  cases when a full post-mortem examination is carried out.  eeos 7900S  91  owe __label__Report

Received 2 October 1991/Accepted 8 January 1992  The E7 gene of human papillomavirus type 16 encodes a multifunctional nuclear phosphoprotein that is functionally and structurally similar to the adenovirus (Ad} ELA proteins and the T antigens of other papovaviruses. E7 can cooperate with an activated ras oncogene to transform primary rodent cells, trans activate the Ad E2 promoter, and abrogate transforming growth factor B-mediated repression of c-myc. Recent studies suggest that these functions may in part be a consequence of the ability of E7 to associate with the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRB). In this study, a series of site-specific mutations of the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 gene product were constructed and assessed for their effects on intracellular protein stability, ras cooperativity, transcriptional trans activation, pRB association, and phosphorylation. The results of these studies indicate that the transforming and frans-activating domains extensively overlap within a region of the protein analogous to conserved region 2 of Ad E1A, suggesting that pRB binding is necessary for both activities. Deletion of sequences in conserved region | abrogates cellular transformation but has only a marginal effect on frans activation. These data suggest that E7 trans activation  WILLIAM C. PHELPS,’* KARL MUNGER,” CAROLE L. YEE,” JULIE A. BARNES," anp PETER M. HOWLEY?  and cellular transformation are interrelated but separable functions.     Both epidemiological and biological data support the divi- sion of the mucosa-associated human papillomaviruses (HPYs) into two groups: those associated with benign Ie- sions, including condyloma acuminata, which are at low risk for malignant progression (HPV type 6 [HPV6] and HPV11), and those represented by HPV16 and HPVI8, which are considered high risk because of their association with intra- epithelial neoplasia, a precursor to cervical cancer (37). The E7 proteins of the high-risk HPVs, which are consistently expressed in HPV-positive cervical carcinomas and derived cell lines (3, 42, 43), can induce morphological transforma- tion of established rodent cells in culture (7, 22, 37, 49, 50, 52). E7 also can cooperate with an activated ras or fos oncogene to transform primary rodent cells (37, 48}. The expression of the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 proteins together can efficiently induce immortalization of primary human epithelial cells (19, 20, 29).  The HPV16 E7 protein is an acidic 21-kDa nuclear phos- phoprotein with no known enzymatic activity. The amino terminus of the HPV E7 protcin shares substantial amino acid sequence similarity with two noncontiguous portions of the adenovirus (Ad) ELA proteins (37). In addition, E7 is functionally related to ELA and simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen in that it can cooperate with ras, trans activate the Ad E2 promoter (37), and abrogate the transforming growth factor B-induced transcriptional repression of the c-mye promoter in keratinocytes (38). The amino acid sequences in conserved region 2 (CR2) of each of these oncoproteins are required for their association with pRB, the product of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene (5, 6, 13, 14, 30, 53, 54).  Previous genetic studies indicated that CR1 and CR2 are required for E1A cellular transformation functions, including stimulation of host DNA synthesis, cooperation with ras, pRB association, and transcriptional repression of certain  * Correspunding author.  2418  genes. In contrast, CR3 of ELA, which is present in the product of the Ad E1A 13S RNA but not in the product of the 12S RNA, is responsible for the major E1A-mediated transcriptionul runs-activation function (9, 10, 32). Amino acid sequences that are similar to that of Ad ELA CR3 are not present in SV40O T antigen or in the E7 proteins of the HPVs, suggesting that this transcriptional regulatory region is unique to ELA,  A recent analysis of HPV16 E7 trans activation indicated that the binding sites for the cellular transcription factor E2F are necessary for activation af the Ad E2 promoter by both E7 and EIA. Recent studies have indicated that.the E2F transcription factor is a cellular target for the pRB protein (2, 11, 12), The E7 protein is functianally similar to the 12S ELA product in that it can perturb the association of E2F with cellular proteins, including cyclin A and pRB (34).  In this study, a scries of HPV16 E? mutants were analyzed to map the domains involved in the transcriptional trans activation and cellular transformation functions of the E7 gene product. These data suggest that for HPV E7, cellular transformation and trans activation of the Ad E2 promoter are related but separable functions. Cellular transformation required two separate regions analogous to the Ad ELA CRI and CR2 domains, and transcriptional trans activation mapped to an overlapping region of the CR2 domain.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell culture. African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells and COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL 1651) were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine scrum supple- mented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 pe/ml). Primary baby rat kidney cells were prepared from 6-day-old Fischer rats as previously described (40). The kidneys were finely minced and digested with collagenase and dispase. Approximately 3 x 10° to S x 10° cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown in the medium described  above. __label__Scientific

2.2. Measurement and estimation of smoke dosage to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke  Martin J. JARVIS AND MICHAEL A. H. Russet  INTRODUCTION  Recent increased public awareness and con- cern about environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has derived from a number of epidem- iological studies which have suggested signifi-  _eant risks to the health of the exposed non-  stnoker. Some studies have found that young children with smoking parents have an increased risk of bronchitis and pneumonia, especially in the first year of life (1, 2). Adults chronically exposed to ETS have been reported to have impaired lung function (3) and an increased risk of lung cancer (4-6). The issue has provoked intense debate (7-9), and it is fair to say that the reality of the risks is not as yet generally accepted by the scientific commu- nity. One of the weaknesses of the studies so far performed is that they have not attempted to quantify the actual dose of ETS received by the non-smoker, although, as one critic has argued, this is fundamental to evaluation of the evi- dence (10).  Epidemiological investigation of the risks of ETS exposure would benefit from both a reti- able non-invasive marker and a validated ques- tionnaire for assessing the degree of exposure. While blood carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) has been found to be of use in short-term studies, it  is not specific to tobacco smoke and may not be sufficiently sensitive to reflect the totality of exposure across the whole range of situations occurring in daily life. Thiocyanate (SCN) may likewise suffer from a lack of specificity and sensitivity. Nicotine is specific to tobacco but has a short half life in plasma, and its major metabolite, cotinine, may provide a better guide.  The present paper addresses several issues on estimating the human dose of ETS. In the first section we present data relating to the validity of self-reports of ETS exposure and to the choice of biochemical marker for use in epidemiological surveys. We then document the smoke dose received from a short-term natural exposure, and in the final section relate this to blood and urinary nicotine levels resulting from slow intravenous infusion of small known doses of nicotine. This enables us to reach some conclusions about the dose received from ETS, as opposed to that received from smoking. These studies will be published in greater detail elsewhere.

Draft —- 1/25/91  P --_ I  Advertising has evolved through the centuries from a simple tool of commerce to a vital and visible part of our culture. From handbills to television to blimps, advertisements reflect the concerns, interests, contemporary trends and desires of our society.  Advertising benefits both buyers and sellers -- in a word, everyone. Advertising supports our free and independent press. Advertising brings us sports and entertainment in person, on radio and on TV. Advertising helps us make informed consumer choices and stimulates the market competition that leads to more product choices, better quality and lower prices.  But today, advertising is under attack. According to public opinion polls, much of the general public has come to regard advertising as a nuisance at best, and as a deceptive persuader at worst. Critics have accused advertising of encouraging or even causing a long list of social 11s -- from high cholesterol to alcohol abuse to urban crime. As a result of these accusations, some -- even some public officials -- have called for drastic restriction of the right to advertise.  Mike Roarty -- executive vice president for corporate marketing at Anheuser-Busch -- described the situation ina speech last year to the  American Advertising Federation. Here's a lengthy but insightful excerpt from Mike's remarks:  ae aenank  "Advertising Under Attack” Excerpts from remarks by Mike Roarty to the American Advertising Federation  Advertising is under attack and our very freedom to advertise is threatened. Social critics of both the left and the right heve focused on advertising as the cause of a never-ending list of national iils.  Their all-purpose prescription for society’s problems is a simple one: Just get rid of those ads! And lest any of you become complacent, let me emphasize that we're not talking here just about beer advertising -- we're talking about  Bll advertising. All advertising is under the gun, and your product or your client may well be next.  Consider a few recent news stories:  ° In Finland, a court banned a McDonald's ad showing 2 youngster who is upset over moving, but who smiles when he spots a McDonald's near his  new home. The court found the ad deceptive, saying it suggests that Big Macs can replace friends.  -j)-     7369 SLLOS __label__Report

June 26, 1980  Mr. A. G. Moore  Alternate Puffing Methods: Pentane Batch Processor  Purpose: ’  To compare tobacco that was not puffed, tobacco processed through the continuous FC~ll system, tobacco processed through the pentane batch  processor, and tobacco processed on the pentane porous belt, and to evaluate the G-13 pentane batch processor.  ‘  Summary:  G~13A from the same lot was processed through the continuous FC-11l system at No. 601, through the pentane batch processor, and the pentane porous belt, Cigarettes were made using ‘tobacco from each process and  unpuffed G-13A, and using the WINSTON LIGHT 84 blend containing the four G-13A types -as- replacement for regular G-13A.  The cigarette weight reduction using the FC-11 processed tobacco was greater than either pentane method, using 100 percent G-13A (44 vs. 38%). Weight reduction of the tobacco rods using the blend was 7.4 percent: for FC-11, 6.1 percent for batch, and 7.6 percent for the belt processed G-13A. Draft was much higher for the FC~11 processed G-13A than for the pentane  processed tobacco. Chemical analyses showed higher nicotine loss and lower sugar loss for the belt method than the FC-1l or batch. TPM, "Tar", and  nicotine in the smoke was lower for the FC-11 process than either pentane method. Essential oils analyses indicated that the pentane batch process was less severe, the FC-l1l1 process was intermediate, and the pentane belt  process was most severe. Smoking panel evaluation did not reveal superiority for any process over the other.  The pentane batch processor requires two hours cycle time and pressures approaching 90 psia to produce tobacco puffed, about equivalent to that produced in the FC-1l continuous process. The pentane batch puffing system is technically feasible; the liquid jet evacuation system does not appear to be. The system would be labor intensive and present safety hazards.  Recommendations:     If pentane investigations continue:  1. Study the feasibility of a continuous belt system with remote control.  HZLt 9Tn0S __label__Letter

This expansion was in addition to San Francisco, Los Angeles/ San  Diego, and Sacramento (the Original markets).  The target segment for the Lucky Strike Filters was defined as free-thinking, independent-minded Male 21-30 Full Revenue, non-menthol, non-ultra, and non-slims smokers who smoke primarily Marlboro and Camel.  Marketing Objectives  The marketing objectives are to create awareness, generate trial and conversion, and enhance Lucky Strike imagery. The Marketing mix elements included:  « Advertising in ‘trendy’ magazines, alternative newspapers, and OOH « In-Store Promotional programs like lighters, pre-pack shippers, mystery shopper, telemarketing B1G1F and  metal tins. + Direct Mail: Two direct mail offerings were made in 1998. The ‘Rooftop’ offer in April was exclusive to the  expansion markets while the ‘multi-sensory’ offer of August covered all the test markets. « HORECA Bar promotions  Research Objectives  The primary focus of this study is to measure the impact of the Lucky Strike Advertising and Promotional programs on Awareness, Image and Usage of Lucky Strike Filters/Lights among the target group and among a representative sample of total smokers. Specific Research Objectives are to measure:  1. Awareness: « Unaided Trademark, Advertising, Direct mail, and Promotion Awareness for Lucky Strike trademark  » Aided Brand and Advertising Awareness for Lucky Strike Filters, Lucky Strike Lights and Lucky Strike trademark » Source of Advertising Awareness  2. Product and User Image of Lucky Strike Filters and Lucky Strike Lights 3. Usage: MOB, ORB, Total Purchase, Free Trials, and Aided Trials Method  The study was conducted in two-waves — April and October 1998. Telephone interviews were conducted in both the original and expansion markets among two groups of smokers:  * arepresentative sample of total smokers who were recruited via random dialing of households; and * atargeted sample of Male 21-30 year old Full Revenue, non-menthol, non-ultra, and non-slims smokers.

AERVUA FOLCLUr IER <JD ; ' ve tet OM, fie ae tov  JUL 12 'S9 12:2) LEO BRETT P.4  _—  osvonusU/ » # 4  6  CIGARETTE AD SHOWDOWN SET  by Chinta Strausberg  Denying charges that she was forced to cancel a recent meeting she chairs that was scheduled to hear testimony on a bill banning outdoor cigarette ads, Ald. Sheneather Butler (27) has set a "showdown" session where top public relations guns say they will be waiting to proverbially ambush her resolution and send it  scurrying into the sunset.  After waiting for 90 minutes for the aldermen, several tobacco executives and lobbyists, who had flown in from Washington, D.C. and Springfield, left the meeting room but vowed to attend her June 14, 10 a.m. Health Committee meeting where pro-smoking forces will verbally sword fight over community complaints that Black neighborhoods have allegedly been flooded with billboard ads depicting smoking as "OK," seductive, cool, according to Butler.  Should the aldermen muster up the needed 26 City Council votes for passage, the controversial bill would ban outdoor cigarette ad signs and rolling papers which is often used for smoking  marijuana.  But such heavyhitters as Jack Kraft, chief financial officer of Leo Burnett Company, Stephen R. Shinn, from Gannett Outdoor of  Chicago, and Ellen Venable, executive director of the Chicago Advertising Club, who were poised to testify last week, told the  Chicago Defender they are more concerned about censorship by the singling out of outdoor cigarette ads which is how they make their  living and that of their clients.  Promising an all-out war against this alleged censorship, Kraft asked, “Have you ever heard of a little bit of censorship?" He and the others feel that the First Amendment would be violated should this bill pass.  While sensitive to the issues of youth smoking and the possible rippling effect that sometimes leads to drug use, Kraft said the  singling out of cigarettes is "wrong" and perhaps unconstitutional. "What do we do next target sugar for banning?"  Shinn said zeroing in on cigarette advertisement is "unwarranted" with Venable arguing that the problem is not with billboard ads but rather the lack of enforcement of minors being allowed to purchase cigarettes.  Shinn said the tobacco industry spends about $600 million a year for advertisement mostly in newspapers and magazines and only two percent on billboards.  TYILBC 011042 __label__Report

s%  1.  PER BwALSH .  July ~ September Quarterly Report - Human Studies  Determination of Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels in smokers -  In the urine mutagencity study, COHb levels were determined for smokers during the puff profile/blood/breathing studies using an Instrumentation Laboratories Model #482 Cooximeter. Blood was drawn at time 0 + 10 min. after lighting for both test and reference cigarettes. COHb levels were also determined during the Pharmacokinetic Study for both test & reference brands. Blood was drawn at time 0, and times 7.5 and 10 min. during smoking of the 7th cigarette. (See Cheryl Miller's report for comments on statistics).  Thiocyanate (SCN) Levels in Smokers and Nonsmokers -  Data on serum SCN levels was graphed for each smoking group as well as the nonsmoking group in the Urine Mutagenicity Study. Blood was drawn (non-fasting) at four ~ different intervals during the study, with the 2nd and 3rd  draw dates unique to each group (Si's 7/15 and 7/29, S2's =...  7/29 and 8/12, NS's 7/22 & 8/5). SCN levels were high for non-smokers initially. Each group had the lowest level on their 3rd drawing, even though they were on different dates. The 3rd drawing was during the test smoking period for each smoking group.  Development of Data Base for Human Studies -  Data Bases were established on the Sun computer for  subject information, pre & post study physical information, and COHb levels. To date, most of the data has been entered. Data base for clinical chemistries remains to be developed.  Collection of Data regarding Chemical Exposure -  The seventy-two participants in the Urine Mutagenicity Study were asked to keep a daily record of exposure to  tobacco products, chemicals, and any medications taken. Weekly reports were generated from these diaries and provided  to the Genetic Toxicology Group. The reports will be used in conjunction with Ames tests on 24-hour urine samples obtained on Days 5 and 7 for each of 6 weeks. As the results of the.  Ames tests come in, the appropriate week's report will be \\ screened for any exposure to potential mutagens. ‘  Diet, Method of Food Preparation and Mutagenicity -  High temperature cooking of protein foods has been associated with the formation of mutagenic compounds.

Response to Comments Offered by Reviewer #2 in Connection with "Estimation of the Effect of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on the Air Quality Within Aircraft Cabins"  The following paragraphs respond to comments offered by Reviewer #2 in connection with Manuscript Number ES8601745.  Comment #1.  Reviewer #2 writes in the first paragraph that the data [contained in our report] could introduce some solid and scientific numbers into an otherwise emotional and political public issue. In the second paragraph the reviewer adds that the authors seemed to be more concerned with  defending the accuracy and integrity of the analytical procedures than with the conclusions that can be drawn from the work.  Response.  We agree with the reviewer’s comment regarding the emotional and political aspects of the issue we investigated. We also agree with the comment dealing with the greater concern indicated for defending our analytical procedures. In preparing the manuscript, we anticipated the possibility of emotionalism and politics affecting review, and consequently we took great effort to ensure that our procedures were  described as completely as practical within the constraints of maintaining brevity. .  Comment #2.  The reviewer apparently suggests that the manuscript discuss our  results in view of health standards or relevant toxicological information.  Response.  While we are aware of the TLV for nicotine, we believe that use of this figure for comparative purposes is inappropriate and potentially misleading owing to its specific applicability for assessing exposure to nicotine (exclusive of ETS) in industrial settings. To our knowledge, the literature is devoid of information relating to either toxicological or health aspects specific to nicotine at the levels we measured. Similarly, information relative to ETS (at levels which may be estimated from our results) exists only in the form of epidemiological studies, the results of which are ambiguous and consequently highly controversial. We believe that science is best served by discussing our results only in the context of estimated exposures. It is our hope that  the results we report will prove useful to researchers investigating the relation between exposure and dose.  we  ue  “Cababey:  nGb2 629CS __label__Report

THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE  1875 | STREET. NORTHWEST SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR. WASHINGTON. DC 20006 President  202/457-4800 © 800/898-4433     @- VIA FACSIMILE --  September 21, 1994  TO: The Members of the Executive Committee           FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.  Administrative Law Judge Vitonne yesterday presided over the opening day of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) scheduled 11l-week hearings on the proposed indoor air quality standard. OSHA staff testified in  the morning; the balance of the day was consumed by a cross- examination period.  Dr. Michael Silverstein, OSHA’s director of policy, expressed the Agency’s intent to use the information obtained at the hearing to “assure that the final rule is effective." Noting that ETS issues had received a disproportionate amount of pre-hearing attention, Silverstein stressed that tobacco is only one of many airborne “hazards" OSHA would address in the final rule. He denied any political motivation for the rulemaking.  John Martonik, acting director of health standards programs for OSHA, stressed that the regulation would not ban smoking, but only restrict smoking to separately exhausted smoking areas under negative pressure so that nonsmoking coworkers are "protected ... from the adverse health effects of ETS." Martonik estimated that 4.4 million buildings and 70.7 million workers would be affected  by the ruie. Compliance with the IAQ standard is estimated at $8.1 billion.  Following the opening statements, nearly a dozen individuals acknowledged their intent to cross-examine OSHA staffers. The questions, primarily from tobacco industry representatives, sought to clarify matters ranging from the scope of the rule to the research the Agency cited to support the proposed action. Following one lengthy exchange, Agency staffers stated that the  rule as written does not preempt state and local laws banning/restricting smoking.

SMOKING RESTRICTIONS: THE HIODEN THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH  By Gray Robertson President, ACVA Atlantic, Inc.  Ban smoking.  It's the instant solution to indoor air pollution. Right? No more sore and watery eyes, headaches, mysterious bouts of allergies and asthma, scratchy throats, coughing or other respiratory problems. And best of all,  no more worries about chronic health problems from the air you breathe. Right? .  Wrong. H.L. Mencken might have been anticipating today's debate about smoking on the job and in public places when he wrote: “For every problem there is a solution that is simple, neat -- and wrong." The truth is that reducing or eliminating smoking in the workplace is no solution to the problem of indoor air pollution,  When it comes to poor indoor air quality, tobacco smoke appears to be among the least of our worries. New reports by federal and private experts show that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may be the primary cause of indoor air pollution in as few as 2 percent of all cases,. And that means Kansas City lawmakers will accomplish little or nothing even if they succeed in removing every last wisp of tobacco smoke in the workplace. Complaints of health problems and irritations will persist. We now know that the vast majority of these reports are unrelated to cigarette smoke.  How much of the blame now heaped on ETS is misplaced? The government's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reports that of the 203 major indoor air quality complaints, it examined recently, just four cases -~-- or 2 percent -- were attributable to cigarette smoking. My own independent firm, ACVA Atlantic, Inc., has inspected more than 27 million square feet of office space in 125 major private and public buildings, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the main Federal Reserve Bank. Tobacco smoke was identified as the major contributing factor to air quality problems in only five of those buildings.  These consistent findings make it increasingly clear that tobacco smoke is blamed for-poor indoor air quality simply because it is one of the few indoor air factors that we can see and smell. But high levels of ETS are nothing more than a symptom of poorly maintained and designed ventilation systems. While NIOSH identified ETS as the problem in a tiny handful of instances, inadequate ventilation was btamed in 50 percent of them. ACVA investigations show improper attention to indoor air circulation was responsible in the majority of cases for the spread and breeding of infectious germs and allergenic dusts and spores ~-- not to mention fiberglass particles, asbestos, chemical fumes and a host of other hazardous airborne particles undetectable to the eye and nose.  €Cé98 sEncs __label__Report

One of my earliest studies  was a comparison of dCMP deaminase activity in normal and malignant mammalian tissue (Cancer Res. 23, 454, 1963). Many of my earlier publications involved kinetic studies of various enzymes derived from normal and malignant tissue. In 1967, I (with Drs. E. Borek and P.R. Srinivasan) provided the first demonstration of mammalian DNA methylase (Biochem. 7, 280). In 1967, I joined Dr. Alex Novikoff in the Department of Pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine where I continued studies in nucleic acid metabolism in addition to learning electron microscopic techniques. In 1969, I joined the SUNY Health Science Center as an Assistant Professor of Pharmacology and expanded my research to include experimental cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to my research, I have for the past 21 years been teaching cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy to medical students, house staff and practicing physicians (Continuing Education) at the Medical Center and affiliated hospitals.

ras)  TROLAND  Ml oM. THOMPSON     SUBJECT: PROPOSED STUDIES GN THE EFFECTS GF CYCLODEXTRING UPON THE COMPOSITION OF TOBACCO SMOKE  INTRODUCTION:  This proposal outlines a research project focused on the use of cyclodextrins as a filtering device for benzo[a]pyrene in cigarette smoke.  In brief, cycledextrins (Cy) are carbohydrates formed by the enzymatic degradation of starch. The majority of CyD’s used are alpha, bata and gamma CyD’s are cyclic in which six, seven and eight glucose molecules, respectively, are Linked im a large ring by 1,4 glucoside linkages. This results im 4 rigid, fonical molecular structure with a hollew interior. The dimension of the interior ranges from 5.7 ta 9.95 A in diameter depending upon the number of glucose units and is ca.7.8 A deep. The interior of this cavity is relatively hydrophobic while the erior of the cavity is hydrophobic. These properties of the Cyl allow the formation of stable Cy0 complexes with other molecules. (1)        Taday cyclodextrins are widely used in foods, cosmetics and toiletries due to their ability to molecularly encapsulate flavors and fragrances. It is this ability that makes CyD’s attractive for use im cigarettes. In fact, the possibile uses of cyclodextrins in cigarette filters has not gone unnoticed. Several studies on the application of cyclodextrins to stabilize cigarette flavors have been reported: Rob et al. from Philip Morris examined the stabili ion of menthol, furan, anethole, linslool, geraniol, cineol, citronellal, phenylethyl alcohol, coumarin and cinmamaldehyde.{(2) Fram this work Several patents were abtained.(3,4,5) Im addition ta these studies numerous other people outside of the tobacco industry have investigated Cy complexes of materials common ta beth their interests and cigsrettes. (4) Lorillard studies conducted by FY. Schickedantz have addressed the use CyD’s for flavor stabilization and delivery. He explored the complexation of citral and orange ail with beta-cyclodextrin. (7,98).         A seconde srea af Cyl research has involved the incorporation of Cyl’s Cigarette filters for the purpose of smoke filtration. [Tt has been @ the addition of Cyf’s toe the filter reduces nicotine and tar deliver J iout impairing the arema and fiavar of the cigarette.(7,10) Most patents e in this aspect of Cy2 use have focused on the abilities af Cy’ Co 3  = and micatine. With Lorillard’s emphasis onc ting a afer a cigarette, cyclodextrins appear to offer a great potenti for adsorbing mot > only tar and nicetine but other Biologically active components found in m Cigarette smoke. One category of components of interest include the PAH’s. It has been demonstrated that Cyfl’s form inclusion complexes with  =               rT Li)                                       with ane af the m carcinogenic PAM, benzofalpyrene.(i1) It is the purpose of this ther the presence of CyD’s in the cigarette filter would of benzolaipyrene in smoke and therefore result  imt 2 __label__Memo

Donzi has also failed to provide, for its 28 ZX, annual sales in units and dollars by state and country.  Since Donzi appears to be seeking corrective advertising damages on both a national and international scale, annual dollar and unit sales by state and country are necessary to assess Donzi's damage calculations.

INDIANA UNIVERSITY Medical Center     1100 WEST MICHIGAN STREET INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA 46202  SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY  28th April, I969. .  Dr.J. Morrison Brady, Associate Scientific Director,  The Council for Tobacco Research, 633 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y, IOOIL7.  Dear Dr. Brady,  It was a pleasure to. become acquainted with you at the recent FASEB meeting in Atlantic City, and as you suggested at that time, I am forwarding copies of my curriculum vitae and list of publications. .  Some preliminary studies in my laboratory in Australia resulted  in the recent publication-of a paper in Nature entitled " Nicotine, Smoking  and Cortical Inhibition ", a copy of which is enclosed. I hopefully suggest  that this paper may contain some of the most significant suggestions about the  psychotropic actions of nicotine to have been published and further pursuit  of these experiments may lead to a greater understanding of the psychotropic  actions of tobacco smoke. A comparison of the actions of ordinary and  "de-nicotinised" cigarette smoke on neurones in intact and isolated cortical  areas would constitute a logical extension of my preliminary experiments. I shall _ be moving to Winnipeg later this year to head a neuropharmacology research. group,  and should like to pursue these studies as suggested above. At a later stage,  I should envisage a collaborative series of experiments with colleagues in  the Psychology Department. at Winnipeg.  If you consider that a project along these lines entitled "A Comparison of the actions of nicotine and tobacco smoke on single neurones in the central nervous system" would be of interest to the Council ‘for Tobacco Research, I should be happy to submit an application for support.  As mentioned during our recent conversation, I believe that this technique of recording from single neurones with multiple barrel electrodes, with which it is possible to stimulate or inhibit cells chemically, provides a powerful tool for unraveling problems of this nature.  With best regards, Yours sincerely, (Ne  J.W.Phillis, B.V.Sce.,Ph.D. Visiting Professor in Biophysics. __label__Letter

The attached article refers to important legal opinions, who believe Souza Cruz will win in a second instance, considering that “manufacturing cigarettes is a legal activity... Adversiting and warnings are regulated by law, which makes the cigarettes manufacturing activity even more legitime.” One of the lawyers who has been consulted (Dr. Celso Bastos) also added that “this decision is clearly oriented by US influence”.  An other lawyer (Dr. Jorge Celidénio) questioned “how it could be possible to determine if the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cruz, during his whole life”, and still complemented by saying that “if the person started to smoke as a kid, also his parents should be considered guilty”. Still this same lawyer added “that other habits can also  provoque heart attacks”.  Only one attorney believes that “sf it could be proven that the smoker only consumed cigarettes from Souza Cuz and that his death was really a consequence of the smoking habit, the cause & effect relation would then be a fact”. This same attorney considered, at the other hand, shese proves difficult to be obtained.  Licio Pedro Macsanyi Corporate Affairs Manager  ECEIWE SEP 2.5 097 ROGER G.

Copyright & 1995 by the Cenetics Society of America  The fog-3 Gene and Regulation of Cell Fate in the Germ Line of Caenorhabditis elegans  Ronald E. Ellis and Judith Kimble  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin at Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 33706  Manuscript received September 8, 1994 Accepted for publication October 1, 1994  ABSTRACT  In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, germ celis normally adopt one of three fates: mitosis, spermato- genesis or oogenesis. We have identified and characterized the gene fog-3, which is required for germ cells to differentiate as sperm rather than as oocytes. Analvsis of double mutants suggests that fog-3 is absolutely required for spermatogenesis and acts at the end of the regulatory hicrarchy controlling sex determination for the germ line. By contrast, mutations in fog-3 do not alter the sexual identity of other tissues. We also have characterized the null phenotype of fog-/, another gene required for spermatogene- sis; we demonstrate that it too controls the sexual identity of germ cells but not of other tissues. Finally, we have studied the interaction of these two fog genes with gld-J, a gene required for germ cells to undergo oogenesis rather than mitosis. On the basis of these results, we propose that germ-cell fate might be controlled by a set of inhibitory interactions among genes that specily one of three fates:     mitosis, spermatogenesis or oogenesis. Such a regulatory network would link the  cell fate to the suppression of the other two.  URING animal development, the establishment of  sexual identity is crucial for the proper regulation of many cell fates. In the nematode C. elegans, for exam- ple, the copulatory organs, their underlying muscula- ture, the neurons that control these muscles, the so- matic gonad and the germ tissue all differ markedly between the two sexes. These differences are controlled by a common signal, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes (Mapt and Herman 1979). Animals with two X chromosomes and two sets of autosomes develop as hermaphrodites, whereas animals with one X chro- mosome develop as males. This X-A signal is interpre- ted by a set of regulatory genes that establish the sexual identity of the animal (reviewed by HopGxin 1990; VILLENEUVE anc MevER 1990; KuwaBARA and KIMBLE 1992). We are interested in how the genes that control sexual idenury specify individual cell fates. To study this process, we are analyzing the development of the germ line,  Several factors make the germ line of C. elegans attrac- tive for studying the regulation of cell fate. First, germ cells adopt two terminal fates, each of which can be identified easily: in males they differentiate to form sperm, whereas in hermaphrodlites the first germ cells to differentiate form sperm, but later ones develop as oocytes (HIRSH ef al. 1976), Second, the germ line is the only tissue in the nematode for which new cells are        Corresponding au udith Kimble, Laboratory of Molecular Biol- ogy, 1524 Linden Dove, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706.

This pattern differs from the reproducible set of cell disi- sions that create the soma of C. elegans (SULSTON and Horvrrz 1977; Ristair and HirsH 1979; SULSTON ef al. 1983), but resembles the homeostatic regulation of tis- sue size in higher organisms. Thus, in the germ line. one can analyze how the control of proliferation inter- acts with the regulation of cell fate. Third, powerful genetic methads have been developed for the idenufi- cation of genes that reguiate the sexual identity of gerra cells (¢.g., BARTON ef af 1987; BARTON and KIMBLE 1990).  In this paper, we report the identification and charac- terization of the fog-3 gene, which is required to specifK that germ cells differentiate as sperm rather than as aocytes. Because this gene does not control the sexuai fate of somatic lissiies, we have adopted the name fog. which indicates “ jeminization of the germ line.”” Muta- tions in a second gene, jog], show an identical pheno type (BARTON and KimpLE 1990). We demonstrate that some of these fog-] mutations inactivate fag-1, indicating that it, like fag-3, 1                       ulates the sexual idendty of ge cells, but not of other lissues. Finally, studies of epistasis indicate that both jug-d and fag-3 act in response to the genes of the sex-detcrmination pathway. We propose that fog] and fog-3 respond to this information abou: sexual identity so as to control the fates of specific cells. those of the germ line.

ES SE SE STS  2 a ee  MORE     Brand Positioning Statement  How Consumers View The Brand     The MORE Brand, which offers various color, length,  and slimness configurations, is viewed as different  from all other brands of cigarettes. Importantly, smokers are more familiar with MORE 120's than with  MORE Lights 100's, so that perceptions of MORE 120's drive the image of the total Brand. The distinctive color and the long, slim shape (primarily MORE 120's)  are sufficiently distinctive to impart a specific personality to the MORE smoker. Smokers of the brand  are viewed as possessing a strong measure of independence and strength of character, characteristics of people who would smoke so unique a product. They are seen as primarily women, who are self-assured, mature, confident, sophisticated, and stylish. While some smokers view the MORE user as representing the extremes of these character-  istics, the MORE smoker is nonetheless seen as possessing a multi-faceted personality.  By contrast, the users of MORE's primary competition, Virginia Slims, are viewed as having a much more shallow personality. Smokers of Virginia Slims are perceived as exclusively women who are overtly feminine, clothes- conscious, and somewhat immature. While Virginia Slims' perceptions are consistent with its positioning as a brand for women, consumers do not perceive Virginia Slims as strongly projecting personality traits which help to define the kind of women who smoke the brand.  From the standpoint of product perceptions, the majority of smokers are familiar with the unique appearance of MORE 120's (long, slim, dark brown); however, low levels of awareness exist with regard to MORE Lights 100's more moderate appearance (beige, 100mm, slender). In addition, because of its length and slow burn rate, MORE 120's is also perceived as having a measure of value not inherent in shorter cigarettes.  How We Want Consumers To View The Brand     MORE should be perceived by smokers as a brand family of distinctive cigarettes that is smoked by women who are charismatic, sophisticated, and feminine, and who ,possess presence and personality that women admire and desire to emulate. Her presence is defined by the expression of  her attitude about herself, her attitude toward others, and her appearance via her clothing statement.  *?  @cnl LLEOS __label__Report
PROCEDURES FOR WORK GROUP  NOTE: The four general topics presented today for "brainstorming" were  3.  5.  selected as a means of creating a structure for our initial planning. They are not intended to represent necessarily the priority topics that all of the involved agencies and individuals working toward the Year 2000 will ultimately agree to address.  "BRAINSTORMING" PROCEDURES  The four topics will be briefly overviewed by David Burns, M.D. "Brainstorming" begins after the first morning break.  There will be 30 minutes to brainstorm each of the four topics. Each of the four facilitators will elicit fran the Work Group participants ideas for priority issues within the four general topics.  The objective of each thirty-minute session is to generate as many ideas as possible. :  It will not be necessary to either prioritize or evaluate the many ideas produced regarding each topic.  The Work Group will prioritize the issues generated during the "brainstomming" sessions after the second morning break. Typed copies of the issues/ideas generated in the four sessions will be distributed to all Work Group participants for their use in this prioritizing session.       PETS 69LOS __label__Report

Attachment II  Acceptable Daily Intake of Dicamba  A safe level or acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Dicamba has been calculated by RJRT as follows:  1. An average person weighs 60 kg (conservative).  2. This person consumed 60 cigarettes per day (99.4% of the U.S. population consumes 60 or less cigarettes/day) .-  3. The No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) in a one-year dog study is 1.25 mg/kg.  4. The NOEL (1.25 mg/kg) is used to calculate an ADI for humans.  e@ 1.25 mg/kg + 100 fold safety factor = 0.0125 mg/kg  e 60 kg person x 0.0125 mg/kg = 0.75 mg/day  se 0.75 mg/day + 60 cigarettes per day = 0.0125 mg/cigarette  e 0.0125 mg/cig + 0.89 grams tobacco/cigarette = 0.0140 mg/gram  e 0.0140 mg Dicamba/gram tobacco = 14 ppm as the ADI for Dicamba  Hence, 14 ppm is an acceptable daily intake of Dicamba whether consumed orally or by inhalation. Even with this conservative  estimate, this value is 28 times higher than the 0.5 ppm residue level for Dicamba on tobacco set by the USDA.  In the case of smoke, our studies show less than 5% of the Dicamba present in the cigarette is transferred into the mainstream smoke or to the environment. Therefore, if tobacco were the sole source of Dicamba, the leaf that is used to make cigarettes could contain up to 280 ppm Dicamba and still be within the acceptable daily intake level for Dicamba  (280 x 5% = 14 ppm).  66€E £2905 __label__Report

Further to my memorandum of January 30, I discussed the Reference Cigarette with Dr. Stokes, by telephone, yesterday. It is now apparent that the formula for the Reference Cigarette, which is to be designated Code 1R1, is to remain constant and is not intended to mimic the average of American  blends as they change or may change from year-to-year.  Dr. Stokes regarded my dissertation on the Reference Cigarette (minutes of the fourth meeting--final paragraph on page 8,  all of the paragraphs on page 9, and down to line 16 of page 10) as accurately representing the situation as it  exists today.

To:  From:  PARK 500  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE CHESTER, VIRGINIA  Mr. W. C. Holloman — Date. November 7, 1988  J. W. Lusk je :  Line III Evaporators ~- Soaking for Cleaning  In reference to your question about soaking the evaporators as an alternative means of cleaning, I contacted Sirrine to see if the structural steel was designed to support this type of load.  The attached letter from Jeffrey Reeves of Sirrine confirms that the structural steel will support the flooded weight of all four evaporators.  Since Mr. Reeves left open the question on the support lugs for the evaporator, I contacted Chemetron. Mr. Mike Martin of the Engineering Department at Chemetron told me by phone on November 1, 1988, that all evaporators they build are designed to be flooded and the support lugs are designed to handle this type of load. He said that soaking is a common practice with many of their evaporator customers. He cautioned us not to run the main drive on the rotor as this would do damage to the unit. He mentioned that some users do have a "clean out drive" that turns the rotor very, very slowly to help agitate the soaking solution. He also said to not put any extra pressure on the unit while soaking (i.e. keep vent. valves open so pressure cannot build up).  My recommendation based on the above is to only soak 1 evaporator at a time and ensure that the’ main rotor drive is locked out prior to filling the evaporator. Pulling the cover plate off the top of the mist eliminator and removing the eliminator screen will provide both a vent opening and an inspection port to allow your operator to see when the evaporator is full of water. With this cover off, you could fill the evaporator with process hot water and crack open the jacket steam just a little (5 PSIG or less) to keep the water hot while the unit is soaking.  I understand you have a procedure being written for this operation which I will be reviewing with you prior to using the soaking method for cleaning.  If you have any questions, please contact me. cc: A. 0. Hayes J. R. Lawrence  F. E. Solesbee J. T. White  2031263025  ee __label__Memo

- @l-  Characterization of the Proteins which are Closely Associated with Ligand- Receptor Complex in the Clathrin-Coated Structures in Human KB Carcinona Cells.  Recently, the concept of toxin-monoclonal antibody conjugates serving as potential chemotheraputic agents has been shown to be experimentally feasible. Several laboratories have successfully coupled cytotoxin molecules to monoclonal. antibodies or ligands that bind to specific cell Surface determinants or receptors. However, of major concern now is the development of effective means to increase the intracellular half life and intracellular toxicity of these cytotoxic conjugates. Since most proteins after internalization by cells have been shown to be compartmentalized, isolated from cytoplasm, and subsequently degraded in the lysosames, the half life and toxicity of the cytotoxic conjugates would be greatly impaired if these compounds followed this common intracellular pathway after internalization. Thus, the development of a toxin-carrier which allows cytotoxic conjugates to bypass lysosomal degradation and effectively pass into the cytoplasm has become an important subject in the development of chemotheraputic agents. To approach this problem, understanding the structure of clathrin-coated pits would be an appropriated begining at the Present time.  A primary observation from Ira Pastan's laboratory has been shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transferrin (TF) could be found in plasna membrane coated pits (primary coated pits) at 6 min after ligand internalization, At 22 min EGF was localized in Golgi coated pits (secondary coated pits) while TF was localized in microtubule associated vesicles, This observation clearly indicated that clathrin-coated structures might play some role in the sorting of internalized ligands. In addition, some receptors, such as those for EGF and TF, are randomly Gistributed on the cell surface in the absence of ligand and only become Concentrated (clustered) in coated pits in the presence of ligand. ‘his also indicates that coated pits can aggregate certain ligand-receptor complexes rather than unoccupied receptors. In order to have these sorting processes, cells must have some specific proteins involved in these processes. If it is the case, I believe that these specific proteins involved in sorting ligand-receptor complexes must be closely associated with the ligand-receptor complex. To characterize these specific proteins, the tollowing experiments are proposed.  (1) To examine whether cells have the proteins which are closely essociated with ligand-receptor complex in the clathrin-coated structuy Se Experiments will be carried out to allow cells preincubated with °S- methionine overnight to take up EGF and TF, At various time after uptake, cells will be homogenized and clathrin-coated vesicles will be immaunoadsorbed on anticlathrin-Staphlococcus aureus. ‘he isolated clathrin- coated vesicles will then react with bifunctional cross-linker, such as the noncleabable cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), followed by inmunoprecipitation with anti BGF-receptor antibody or anti [F-receptor antibody. The inmunoprecipitates will then be characterized on SDS=PAGE,  followed by autoradiography. If there is any specific protein closely __label__Scientific

DEVELOPMENTAL REGULATION AND MODULATION OF NEURONAL NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR CHANNELS  Linda K. Simmons, Brenda L. Moss3, Stephen M. Schuetze* and Lorna Ww. Role  Depts of Anatomy and Cell Biology in the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, Columbia University College of Physicians of Surgeons and the  $Dept of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, NY, NY 10032  *The authors dedicate this chapter to the fond memory of their friend and colleague, Steve Schuetze.  INTRODUCTION  To date the best characterized receptor-channel complex is the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), Several studies demonstrate that muscle AChRs are subject to various forms of regulation. Distinct changes in channel properties, receptor distribution and subunit composition are observed over the course of development. Also, acute changes in the degree of receptor phosphorylation induce a functional change in the rate of receptor desensitization (for a review, see Schuetze and Role 1987). These extensive studies of muscle AChR regulation provide an important intellectual framework for studies of other ligand-gated channels in the central and peripheral nervous system.  Initial studies of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors suggest that there may be structural, pharmacological, and functional differences between muscle and neuronal nicotinic receptors (this volume). We are interested in two related problems pertinent to nicotinic AChR function: (1) how neuronal nicotinic receptors of the chick sympathetic ganglion neurons are regulated during development and following synapse formation and (2) how AChR function may be subsequently modulated  by another transmitter present in these ganglia, the peptide substance P (SP).

Caimpagne contre la fumee -APPENOTE Une cinglante réplique  C’dtait & prévoir! L’ Organisation mondiale de ia santé (OMS) a recom- mandé aux Etats-membres de publier les chiffres sur la mortalité due & usage du tabac. Comme 'Helvétie a obél avec une rare Incompétence, elle devail s’attendre & recevolr ane lecgon @’honnéteté scientifique. Vollk qui  est fait avec la réplique — cinglante  1 — du Dr Peter.Atteslander, un pro-  fesseur d'origine suisse dont le paimarts fait autorité.      Une’ vérité scientifique plutdt qu'un pamphlet...  Le Confédération, ls Conférence des ,  directeurs cantonaux des affaires sani- taires et I’Association tabagisme s’tiaient unis pour publier une brochure consacrée & «La mortalité due au tabac en Suisse». Bonne idée, si I’on songe aux conséquences souvent tragiques du tabagisme. Mais aux yeux de Peter Atteslander, elle fut hélas mal concréti- sée, sentant plus le pamphiet de parti- sans que la vérité scientifique. A cause notamment des grossitres approxima- tions sur le nombre de décés attribués a ia fumée. soot  Utile prévention  Peter Atteslander, professeur & l’Uni- versité d’Augsburg, approuve I’inten- tion a la base de la brochure, qui est de susciter des mesures de médecine pré-  _ ventive contre lx consommation exces-  * sive de tabac en raison de ["augmenta- tion des maladies de civilisation. Pour lui aussi, toute exagération dans la con-  ; Sommation d’alcool-ou de tabac peut #tre considérée comme dangereuse pour ja santé.  Mais lOffice fédéral de la santé publique et consorts auraient fait si mal que le professeur Atteslander y'va d°un pan sur le bec. «Le recours aux recom- mandations de "OMS ne dispense pas les auteurs de la brochure de l’obliga- tion de traiter les données épidémiologi- ques avec lexactitude requise et de ne proposer des mesures que sur la base de faits vérifiés», écrit-il.  Hautement problématique  La brochure laisse croire que les chif- fres présentés seraient scientifiquement prouvés, alors que seules des probabili-. tés et non des certitudes sont obtenues, déplore Peter Atteslander. Ce dernier” regrette encore que cle rapport attribue faussement A une simple relation causale l’explication de lorigine des maladies et ne Gent pas comptes de Paugmentation des maladies dites de civilisation et de la multitude des causes possibies».  La constatation de relations causaies est donc «hautement problématique», assure Peter Atteslander.  ee  Information ou manipulation?  S’appuyant sur les constatations de Martin Rutsch, le professeur pourfend le travail présenté par la Berne fédérale. «Données insuffisantes» «grossitres estimations», «base de calcul & la {ois fausse et obscures, collecte de données qui «manque de rigueur scientifique», les carences sont telles que Peter Attes- lander s’autorise & mettre «en garde contre l'usage naif des résultats présen- tés dans cette brochure en tant qu'ils constitueraient une base pour des déci- sions publiques». . /  Le professeur Atteslander n'y va pas par quatre chemins, qui recommande aux éditeurs de «distinguer entre Pinfor- mation qui a pour but ls prévention médicale et la manipulation de données épidémiologiques au service d’intéréts  - particuliers» .  Et Ia liberté?..  . Peter Atteslander estiment par ail-  leurs que ce que pourrait se permettre  une association tabagisme en tant que .  groupe d’intéréts identifiable ne corres- pond pas au devoir de neutralité d'un office fédéral ou d’autorités desquels on serait en droit-d'attendre une stricte neutralté.- 0 280 om.  Legon de libesté enfin, qui engage le professeur Atteslander & prier les autori- tés' de considérer tous les diéments. «Nous devrions accepter les, cdtés posi- tifs des attitudes comportant un risque, surtout en ce qui concerne les décisions relevant de In” liberté individuelie», souligne-t-il -°  . ¢ > + Raymond GREMAUD : : —_/     4 ARGUS  668h0210S2  _ #=e SS  as ee sO AF  CH- 8230 Durch, feiefor O° Dos  wee Ee REVUE BE Loud LAtSeRde  Toeege quoirdier wa ay quie helen Na tRA  1 AUD eae  rors ts __label__News

Prat Atlantic Incorporated     10378 B Democracy Lane Fairfax, VA 22030 (703) 352-0102  October 28, 1987  Ms. Susan Stuntz Tobacco Institute 1875 I Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20006  Dear Susan: i ke Elimin - Airli  I am sorry about my delay in writing about this filter and in truth have little to say about it.  There are several high efficiency filters available that work on a similar principle, ic. prefilter, high efficiency particle filter, then charcoal absorbent material. They are indeed efficient and efficiencies of 95 to 98%  for smoke particles are usual claims (LR&G’s 99.6 to 99.9% seems unnecessarily ambitious). The odor elimination efficiency of 88% is also  higher than most manufacturers claim, but only tests would confirm or disprove this data.  I suspect that the real problem will be an operational life. Airline particle filters apparently clog fairly quickly and need to be changed frequently. If one inserts a more efficient filter, I would expect it to clog more quickly  and would expect high pressure drops through the filter. This, however, is again subject to proper trials.  I do, however, find it hard to believe that their layer of "charcoal paper" would last long as an odor controller. Banks of charcoal rapidly loose efficiency as absorbers of odors and need frequent replacement, and their brief literature describes a “paper film" of charcoal, not a bank of material.  { would be surprised if the odor removed efficiency stayed at 80% for 1,000 hours, never mind the 3,000 to 6,000 hour claim.  I would like to think these would work as well as they claim, but I doubt it,  Kindest regards,  ADL.  GR/mrv  TI DN 0006603 __label__Letter

Mazzitelli  Product Requirements: Vantage, Mark VII and New Leaf Identified Tests  As you know, we are planning to undertake personal placement tests in 4 cities of identified Vantage, New Leaf and Mark VII. In order to implement these tests, we require 32,000 cigarettes(160 cartons) each of New Leaf and Mark VII. (The Vantage cigarettes will be purchased from jobbers in each city.) All brand and other identifying markings on both the cartons and individual packages are not  to be removed, since these are identified tests. Finally, we must insure that both the Mark VII and New Leaf cigarettes are of comparable age.     It must be understood that the Mark VII being referred to here is the product that  is currently being sold in the Tucson test market, and not the new or improved versions currently being developed by R&D.  The 160 cartons of both Mark VII and New Leaf should be divided into the following quantities and shipped to these addresses for tax stamping purposes:  Quantity (ctns.)

AK: Well, that's exactly what I was going to ask you guys to do because I'm going to make a transcript of this thing for Mr. Ker~ rigan's benefit and we're not as sophisticated as he is and I'm going to use my little portable mike.  JB: I've got a tape thing if you want me to do it.  AK: No. That's alright.  JB: I mean I've got a telephone attachment and I'll just send you the transcript. It depends on what you want to do.  AK: Oh, that's alright. Why don't you do it too, then you can -, check my stuff. Want to do that?  “JB: Sure.  AK: Sure, what the hell - it doesn't make any difference. How was your Thanksgiving?  AJ: Alright.  RS: Good.  AK: Did you guys have a nice peaceful four day weekend? RS: Yup.  JB: Not peaceful but it was nice.  AK: Ha Ha Ha! I love it!  RS: Where's Dan?

We have labeled this as request number B1060. It was produced from the MCP SAS History week ending 9/26/98.  There were some changes made to the request.  * We changed the completeness store count to include active and completeness checks for 65 out of 65 weeks. This is just a store count and does not have an impact on the volume reported.  * We were unable to provide the Retail Masters Y/N column. This was excluded fram the report.  * The total store counts for 1997 and 1998 are calculated based on the current definition of the stores within a chain. This means that the  stores associated with the chain in the current time period will be the same stores checked on the 1997 history. We do not keep old assignments of  retail ids to a particular chain. Therefore there would not be a difference between the counts. We created one column with the total STARS stores and another based on the Retail Masters stores.  * The CPW values are based on the average per chain within a week. We pulled the data from LINQ and collapsed it by chain. Then that value was divided by the total number of retail ids within the chain.  If you have any questions, just let me know.

However, if this becomes widespread, it would flaw the test but | don’t think the retailers will reduce their margins by $.50.  The marquee/awning program can be sold and implemented in higher volume convenience gas outlets and is not exclusive to cigarette outlets; however, CO's would be our first priority.  The $.50 per carton/$.05 per pack applies to all trade segments. The bottom line is in the entire retail universe within the Kansas City Division should reflect Doral $.05 less a pack/$.50 less a carton vs. branded competitive sets.  Relative to the pricing survey issues, adjustments will be made which will reflect on strategy if Doral is $.50 less a carton/$.05 less a pack vs. branded competitive sets.  The additional part-time labor request (32 hours a week) is still under consideration. Will advise when decision has been made.  Sincerely,  R.

Long FROM: Gene Ainsworth ~~~"~= SUBJECT: Government Relations Status Report |  e On October 29, the Senate approved by voice vote an amendment to the. FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit: smoking  on commercial airline flights of 1 1/2 hours or less for a period of two years. This amendment was substituted for Senator Lautenberg’s_  proposal to ban smoking on flights of two hours or less for a period of three years. Earlier this year, the House approved an amendment to its version of the FY 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less for an unlimited period of time. The two bills will now go to a conference committee where the differences between the bills’ smoking provisions will be resolved. ,  e On October 29, the House approved its budget reconciliation bill by a vote of 206 to 205. The bill raises $12.8 billion in new revenues without increasing excise taxes on cigarettes or denying deductions for tobacco product advertising and promotion expenses. The Senate is expected to consider its version of the reconciliation bill next week. Simultaneous to this action in_the House and Senate are the daily meetings of the budget summit between the Administration and Congress.  Even if we survive in the House and Senate budget reconciliation bills without a cigarette tax increase, we could still be vulnerable to an  excise tax hike if the budget summit recommends revenues above that in the reconciliation bills.

Two Indoor Air Quality Investigations -- Oceans Apart  Simon Turner Healthy Buildings International Inc. (HBI) 10378 Democracy Lane Fairfax, Virginia 22030 U.S.A.  INTRODUCTION  A commonly seen method of indoor air evaluations in buildings perceived as “sick" involves an engineering study of a building in conjunction with a questionnaire administered to its occupants. As a result we now have evidence that tighter, air conditioned buildings generate higher incidence of upper respiratory complaints than naturally ventilated buildings.':? However, this combination of engineering evaluation and occupant questionnaire as a diagnostic method for sick buildings has not provided us with the ability to predict the cause of indoor air problems from occupant symptoms.  One major reason for this appears to be that many common irritants found in indoor air result in a similar range of upper respiratory symptoms. Many diagnosed “sick" buildings are reported to have their causes rooted in ventilation, filtration or hygiene problems which allow a mixture of low level pollutants to build up 2-4 These irritate occupants in a complex and possibly synergistic manner, the mechanism of which is largely unknown to us.  To demonstrate the range of engineering characteristics which can produce similar complaints of sick building syndrome, this paper presents two case histories of identically sized buildings, the studies of which were completed in July of 1989. One of these buildings (designated as Building A) was located in Washington D.C., and the other (designated as Building 3) was located in San Diego, California. Both buildings are 600,000 square feet in size and a full description of their respective characteristics is found in the results section.  Symptomology  The following symptoms were reported in Building A during the year previous to this study: sneezing and/or coughing; sinus congestion; dry nasal passages; post nasal drip; rashes amd dry skin; headache; breathing difficulties; sore throat; drowsiness; fatigue; eye irritation. In Building 5 the following complaints were noted over the same period of time: odors; headaches; shortness of breath; eye irritation; dizziness. These symptoms in both buildings compare well with the classic symptomology of the sick building syndrome as defined in the Commission of the European Communities Report -- Sick Building Syndrome, A Practical Guide) which lists the symptoms as follows: nasal irritation with nasal stuffiness; dryness and irritation of the mucous membrane of the eye; dryness and irritation of the throat; skin dryness and irritation; headaches, generalized lethargy and tiredness.

(i.e. the Parliament and Milds arrow was effective - minimal sq inches and not confined to height and width).

Brief information from two inter- views, two plant tours, and from some of the papers is given in the body of  this report.  Memorandum:  A EMPLO CL, H  Two job notices were posted at the Employment Clearing House for organic and physical chemists to work on the isolation and identification of natural  products. Thirteen applicants signed these notices. Data on these applicants and on about 30 other organic and physical chemists were brought back to our  laboratory for screening. INTERVIEW WITH A STEROID s HEN  One of the men who signed our job notice was Dr. C. Chen, an Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at Northwestern University School of Medicine. He also called me at my hotel and we met and talked for an hour.  i}  Dr. Chen has published about 15 papers on natural products, especially steroids. He is only partly inclined to leave his present connection, but would be interested in tobacco research that utilized his knowledge of steroids, He might engage in such research at Northwestern, either sponsored  or gratis.  Dr. Chen feels in particular that the steroids in tobacco should be characterized, and an effort made to see whether they lead to carcinogenic  materials in tobacco smoke. Also, if any tobacco steroid qualifies as starting material for a medicinal such as cortisone, the resulting publicity  would be of great value to the tobacco iniustry.  If Dr. Chen does not qualify for an opening in our laboratory, it is suggested that he be referred to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee for  a possible research grant,  690 LO00S __label__Report

There was a record turnout of physicians from around the country with more than 1,700 presentations. Press coverage was extensive, but the smoking reports attracted little attention.  To further emphasize the smoking and heart disease issue, the AHA had the Surgeon General's November 17 press conference piped into the press room. A statement was then issued by the AHA on its reactions to the Surgeon General's report:  "Viewed over the long term, the cost in human lives from continued smoking is staggering. As many as 10% of all Americans now alive may die prematurely of heart disease related to their smoking behavior...this means 24 million premature deaths due to smoking....The American Heart Association pledges to continue unrelenting efforts to make the American public more aware of both the grievous dangers of smoking and the health benefits that can quickly come from its cessation...."  According to Leonard Zahn, reporters from the major media left coverage of the Surgeon General's report to their Washington bureaus and paid little attention to the AHA's statement.  Highlights of the meeting follow: SMOKING AS A RISK FACTOR  Aaron Folsom, Minneapolis, reported on a study that assessed the use and possible health risks of low-yield cigarettes (15mg ag or less of tar). Levels of serum thiocyanate (a metabolic © product. of hydrogen cyanide which is in the gas phase of the jad main stream of cigarette smoke) and cigarette brands smoked ei were determined in 2,561 adult smokers who were among 9,106 3 persons participating in two heart disease risk factor surveys aj in seven upper midwestern communities from 1980 to 1982. a} = “J  Findings indicated that compared to 1980 data for the country as a whole, a greater proportion of smokers in these  communities smoked low-yield brands.

Vol. 264 No. 24  , ©LT60041711  SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER — LITTLE 1241  SOME PHASES OF THE PROBLEM OF SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER Cuarence C. Litre, Sc-D.* ELLSWORTH, MAINE  M’ object in discussing the subject of smoking in relation to lung cancer is quite different from that of Dr. Wynder. His purpose is to present data that have convinced him that smoking is a major — perhaps the major — cause of lung cancer. This he has dene before many groups over a period of years. He does so with complete conviction and with en- thusiasm. He professes little interest in the broad question of lung-cancer etiology outside smoking whereas the fact that the disease develops in non- smokers as well as in smokers seems of basic sig- nificance to me. One cannot properly disregard re- search on the total mechanism of cancer formation in favor of dealing with an assumed environmental agent not active in some cases.  It is my purpose to present certain of the reasons why all such data (which are at times based on rather superficial, scattered and indirect observations} fail tu convince other scientists and medical men that a cause-ar.d-effect relation between tobacco use and bronchogenic carcinoma has been established.  This does not mean that certain existing studies have not produced suggestive findings. }t merely pro- poses that the many problems raised by such studies are not yet solved and that much more research in depth is needed before definitive answers will be avail- able.  In the process of this brief discussion there will be some mention of methods for qualitatively more ac- curate and scientific levels of research than those now employed by some investigators.  To expect, as Dr. Wynder and some others do, that those still unconvinced should state the exact and specific evidence that would “convince” them is being completely unrealistic. If one could define such specific evidence the problem would be already solved. The following suggestions, however, may in- dicate some steps toward clearing the tangle of con- fused and conilicting opinions now prevalent.  No effort will be made to follow a definite classi- fication of evidence, but certain pertinent fields of imerest are convenitnt focal points in an even brief consideration of the entire situation.  PaTnoioscy  From the pathological aspect, areas af epithelial metaplasia in the lungs have been Aatly interpreted by a minority group of pathologists as being pre- cancerous areas significantly associated with smoking.  ‘Scientifie director, Tobacco Ind Research 3 e enti ‘or ndvatey Committer; director  However, similar lesions have been found in infants, in children and in nonsmokers. It i¢ known that several diseases, many of which are commonly as- sociated with childhood years, will produce such lesions in bronchial epithelium. This shows that the origin of these lesions may be independent of smoking.  These lesions have also been found in large num- bers in the trachea, over which all inhaled smoke must pass but in which caricer is clinically rare. The epithelial tissues of the trachea and the bronchi are very similar. Therefore, one must ask, and there is no satisfactory answer, if smoking does cause lung cancer, why is it that the trachea does not form cancer as the lung does?  Though some claim that these epithelial lesions in the lung occur in greater numbers in smokers than in nonsmokers, it has also been shown that this is tis of persons who are afflicted with pneumonia. Therefore, the increase in the lesions is not distinctly diagnostic of any eflect of tobacco.  Added to these facts, pathologists need to make woueerted efforts to improve and agree upon criteria for classification of human lung tumors into types fuch as adenoma and squamotis-cell cancer so that studies of relative rates of incidence and of possible environmental and other influences on such rates could be made more meaningful.  Thus, there are basic gaps in pathological obser- vations and interpretations indicating that the evi- dence in this field falls far short of being adequate or conclusive  To clear up the existing discrepancies and disagree- ments among pathologists is one prerequisite to fur- ther progress based upon more significant definitions.  Anma. ExpaRiMENTATION  Dr. Wynder was one of the fust tu report the pro- duction of skin cancers in certain strains of mice painted repeatedly with strong concentrations of lobacco-smoke condensates. This type of work has been accepted by some as “evidence” of a causative relation between smoking and human cancer of the lung.  However, proponents of this kind of data ignore or depreciate the more applicable research in which the lungs of animals have been exposed for long periods to whole smoke — which is the accused material — without the production of any rmalignant tumors. Here, the lung of an animal is being challenged, nor the skin, and whule smoke being used, not a ma»  chine-made concentrate. There have becn muany such experiments here and abroad. and none have __label__Scientific

Andrew Mitchell, Ph.D.  Assistant Professor of Anatomy  School of Medicine  Wayne State University ' 540 East Canfield Street  Detroit, Michigan 4820)  Implantation and Uterine Function in the Rat.  Considerable evidence indicates that nicotine adversely affects pregnancy in the rat. Among such disruptive effects are increased frequency of fetal resorption, reduced litter size and weight, and delayed parturition. The primary objective of the experiments embodied in this study is to gain a greater understanding of the means by which nicotine exerts disruptive effects on the     normal course of pregnancy, and more particularly, how the chief alkaloid of tobacco  reduces litter size and delays parturition. To this end, a variety of parameters will be measured to assess reproductive efficiency, time of implantation, fetal  growth and development, and normalcy of parturition in nicotine-treated vs. control rats.  Severa] experimentally testable hypotheses are proposed. Specifically, experiments will be conducted to determine if nicotine-induced reduction in litter size and delay in parturition are related to alterations in uterine sensitivity to implantation. The time of onset, magnitude and duration of sensitivity to decidualization will be compared in treated and control rats. In addition, the  effects of nicotine on duration of gestation will be determined by an accurate measurement of the time of parturition.  Recent experiments have demonstrated that both the development of the preimplantation blastocyst and the time of zona pellucida loss are delayed in nicotine-treated rats. Experiments are in progress to assess: (1) the magnitude of the delay, (2) the hormonal conditions under which it occurs, and (3) various aspects of the intrauterine environment.

MCLEAN, COL, MC, USA  A study relating the intralesional infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells to patient survival was performed on cases of uveal malignant melanoma accessed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC (AFIP) between 1954 and 1973, The authors examined 1193 cases using light microscopy. Of the 1078 cases with technically acceptable histologic sections, 134 tumors contained 100 or more lymphocytes per 20 high-power (X400) microscopic fields (20 HPF). The prevalence was 12.4%. This was designated the “high lymphocytic” group. An equivalent number of cases with fewer lymphocytes comprised the “low lymphocytic” group. The survival rate at 15 years was 36.7% for patients in the high lymphocytic group and 69.6% for patients in the low lymphocytic group. Using the Cox model, the authors found that an increased number of lymphocytes per 20 HPF was significantly associated with decreased survival (chi-square = 24.2, P = <0.0001). A significant association was observed even when we controlled  for other risk factors (chi-square = 6.98, P = 0.008).  Cancer 65:112-115, 1990.  T HE IMMUNOLOGIC role of lymphocytes and plasma cells in malignant tumors has been extensively stud- ied in the last two decades. Speculations have been made on whether or not the presence of these mononuclear cells in tumors has an effect on patient survival. Underwood,! in his review of the literature, found a favorable association between lymphocytic infiltration and patient survival in most cancerous tumors. In succeeding publications,?* contradictory results were presented regarding this asso- ciation in cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma. In patients with uveal malignant melanoma, Davidorf and Lang? found that the survival was better if the tumor con- tained a lymphocytic infiltrate, whereas Vit® found the opposite. Interpretation of these studies is difficult because lymphocytic infiltration was either poorly defined or sub- jectively evaluated. Because of these problems we under- took a study relating intralesional lymphocytic and plas- macytic infiltration in uveal malignant melanoma to pa- tient survival.

Materials and Methods  One thousand one hundred nincty-three uveal malig- nant melanoma cases accessed between 1954 and 1971 were retrieved from the files of the Registry of Ophthalmic Pathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC for use in this study. One thousand sev- enty-eight cases had hematoxylin and eosin-stained his- tologic sections that were technically acceptable. All tu- mors containing 100 or more lymphocytes per 20 high- power (400) microscopic fields (HPF) were selected for the “high lymphocytic” group. We chose the next accessed case of uveal malignant melanoma with less than 100 lymphocytes per 20 HPF for the “low lymphocytic” group. Without knowledge of the patients’ follow-up data, the number of lymphocytes and plasma cells were counted separately in 20 HPF within the tumor; tumor size in its largest dimension (LTD) was measured; Callender cell type, degree of necrosis, mitotic activity, distribution of lymphocytes, scleral invasion, and orbital invasion were coded. The risk factors were coded ‘as follows: (1) lym- phocytic and plasmacytic infiltration as the log of the number of cells plus one per 20 HPF; (2) distribution of lymphocytes as perivascular or diffuse; (3) Callender cell type as spindle, mixed, or epithelioid; (4) tumor size as measurement of largest dimension; (5) necrosis as 0 to 4 (0 = no necrosis in the tumor, | = less than 5% of the     50601614 __label__Scientific

We studied lipolytic (fat-mobilizing) activity and glycerol accumulation in culture media exposed to six different human cell lines. An in vitro adipocyte bioassay measured lipolysis. Media from three of four human melanoma celt lines demonstrated significantly elevated hpolytic activities (279-81 7% of fibroblast-exposed, contro! medium), as well as significantly more glyceral accumulation (276-1643% of fibroblast medium) which directly correlated with the increased lipolytic activity. Increased lipolytic activity and glycerol accumulation were not generalized phenomena seen with all growing tumar cells. as two cell lincs (a human colon carcinoma and the fourth human melanoma line) demonstrated neither significantly increased lipolytic activity nor increased glyceral accumulation compared to fibroblast control medium. This study supgests that certain tumor cells are capable of transferring a lipalysis-promoting activity to the media which bathe them. This activity is demonstrable both as increased lipolytic activity in a bioassay of lipolysis, and as an accumulation of glycerol {an end product of trigtyceride lipolysis), in the medivm exposed to the growing cells. ‘The tumor factor(s) re- sponsible for this lipolysis-promoting activity may account for the fat wasting that ofien accompanies  malignancy. © 1986 Academic Press, Inc.  INTRODUCTION  One of the most devastating complications of cancer is the uncontrollable weight loss and energy wasting (“the cachexia of malignancy”) which plagues the tumor host [t, 2]. Numer- ous mechanisms [2, 3] have been praposed, including anorexia and malabsorption (both tumor-related and iatrogenic), and derange- ments of host metabolism. Modern methads of hyperalimentation have not succeeded in reversing cancer cachexia despite the achieve- ment of high parenteral caloric intake [4], leaving one to conclude that altered host me- tabolism is important in the pathagenesis of this malnourished state.  Lipid metabolism in the experimental tu- mor-bearing host undergoes several changes which are reversible by tumor removal [5~7] and which are quite different than those ac-  ‘To whom requests for reprints should be addressed.     445  companying starvation or sepsis alone [8]. The disappearance of retroperitoneal fat stores, coupled with the concomitant development of hyperlipidemia, and the reversal of these abnormalities after tumor excision [5, 6], prompted us to search for a tumor-associated lipolysis-promoting “factor” in our animal models.  Using an in vitro bioassay of lipolysis (de- scribed in this paper), elevated lipolysis-pro- moting activities and glycerol concentrations were found in the serum of sarcoma-bearing rats [7] and in culture medium conditioned by sarcoma cells.? Tumor removal resulted in normalization of serum Jipolytic activity and glycerol concentration, and restoration of lost body weight [7].

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  This should be limited to a maximum of one-half hour presentation. Areas may overlap with Ralph Angiuoli’s. Nevertheless, efforts should be made to over simplify. Wherever possible, data should be presented in diagrammatic form rather than tables (e.g., bar charts, graphs, pie charts were relevant).  A.  Show industry decline over last ten years. Project out for next three. Indicate major events which have influenced the decline (e.g., FET increase, etc.).  Illustrate main segment performance. Segments here should be limited to simple product segments and consumer  demographic segments (e.g., size, flavor, box versus soft, men and women, and age groups).  Show each company’s performance (by share of market) over the last ten years and projecting out over the next three.  Draw simple profile of each company in terms of individual brand portfolios (with individual shares). Suggest we limit to top three brands in each case with all others combined. Indicate company areas of strength and weakness in terms of areas of growth. Refer these where relevant to market dynamics such as segment performance.  Indicate each company’s spending, both in total and by major brand (top three only plus all others combined) .

SUMMARY:  Information concerning a cigarette made of papaya leaves was obtained through conversation with a man from Roswell Park Memorial Institute. This information has been verified and documented.  MEMORANDUM:  During the course of the banquet at the 18th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference, Mr. Raymond J. Shamberger of Roswell Park Memorial Institute offered the observation that he was smoking his "first tobacco cigarette in over a year."" Subsequent conversation revealed that he had been employed by a Los Angeles firm as a os biochemist to assist in developing a cigarette made of papaya leaves. This firm is backed by several very wealthy movie stars. The cigarette is to be marketed within a few months through the Frito-  Lay Corporation which is a nationwide distributor of food stuffs, particularly potato chips and Fritos.  Within the past year Mr. Shamberger was employed by Roswell Park Memorial Institute as a biochemist. He is one of a staff of  about 20 assigned to work on the question of tobacco and health.  Apparently studies of the papaya cigarette were (or are) also made at Roswell Park.  A subsequent check of the corporate structure of Frito-Lay (Standard and Poor, September 18, 1964) showed its relation to Sutton Research Corporation of Los Angeles "to conduct and evaluate consumers’ tests and technical research on a non-tobacco cigarette  made from papaya leaves. Frito-Lay has option to acquire 51% of Sutton."  Cc -  c6ec 0900S __label__Scientific

CONFIDENTIAL  (For Response Only) 4, yy Doral Celebrate America Collector Cards General Statement/Q and A Final Version November 2, 2000 GENERAL STATEMENT  Doral, the leader in the value-price cigarette category, is introducing cigarette collector cards in early 2001 through the Celebrate America Collector Cards program. The 50 states will be featured on the cards and will be issued in two sets of 25 (plus a card listing the states in the set and limited edition cards). The first set is scheduled to appear in the marketplace in early 2001, and the second set wil! follow soon thereafter. Collector cards will appear on select Doral cigarette packs for a limited time only.  Card collecting, or cartophily as experts call it, has been a favorite pastime for collectors dating back to the 19" century. It is being revived and updated for the 21" century by Doral through their Collector Cards series as a way of building on the brand’s promise of giving adult smokers more value for their money.  The collector cards combine the nostalgia of days gone by with modern-day design, giving collectors a highly collectible card series. The front of each card features photos of a landmark or historically preserved scene from the state represented, while the back of the card gives a description of what’s pictured and several facts about the state. The cards do not carry any cigarette brand names or logos.  Q&A:  1. Why have you decided to do collector cards now? Doral is capitalizing on adult smokers’ interest in collectibles. Many Doral smokers have told us they enj oy “collecting” as a hobby. Tobacco collector cards were very popular during the 19" century — losing their popularity circa 1940 — and no major American cigarette brand has distributed them since.  2. What is the cost of the program? This information is confidential. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company does not discuss the costs of any marketing programs, for proprietary reasons.  3. How many cards are there in each series?  S80l 6zeSgz¢ __label__Report
(eT 2 pp: TL -gerrekd docume Tj Last 4 pp: Aout LD  SMOKING IN SWEDEN  o Per capita adult (> 15 yrs. old) cigarette consumption increased from 1,726 units in 1977 to 1,781 units in 1981 -- averaging 0.6  percent a year, but variable.  Overall sales of cigarettes in Sweden declined for only one year in this 1977-8L interval, and increased for all other years to 1982.  From 1977 to 1980, Sweden's population increased by only 0.7 percent, but cigarette sales during this period increased by 4.87 percent (from  11.357 billion cigarettes to 11.91 billion).     o Per capita adult cigarette consumption for the period 1975 to 1981 was strongly correlated with sales, with regard to statistical variability, but Swedish population increase was not significantly  related to sales variations.  An article of May 1982 in the Swedish Journal Nordisk Medecin, Vol. 97, pp 134-136, indicated that total tobacco consumption in Sweden is  remarkably stable. Among the conclusions were the facts that some heavy to moderate male smokers have increased use of snuff; there was an increase in smoking quantities among women; the percentage of male  smokers declined moderately but steadily.  Svenska Tobaks AB information dept. reported data [in 1982] on which these trends are based. They also report that 4 percent of the  population roll their own, and these cigarette smokers may increase the actual number of cigarette smokers in Sweden when they are added  to those who smoke manufactured cigarettes (the latter 33 percent of all adults).

—— ~ - .-  _ BRANDS BUSINESS UNIT PRODUCT APPROVAL NOTE  BBU Note No. 15-94 — Date: 6/10/94  Temporary ____ Effective Date 6/27/94 Termination Date ©  Permanent _X  Type: Product _X Process _X Packaging ____ Flavor Tobacco ____ Material Other  SUBJECT: FULL PRICE ULTRA LIGHT NON-MENTHOL FILTER FLAVOR ELIMINATION and PLASTICIZER OPTIMIZATION (Except for NOW  Products)  BACKGROUND: Currently, nine different filter flavors are used in our Premium Domestic products. Of these, three are used in the full price non-menthol Ultra Light styles.  Testing to date indicates that there is no significant taste difference in products containing current levels of filter flavor, no filter flavor or ten times the current level.  Plasticizer level optimization is a program designed to simplify operations by reducing the number of plasticizer gears used by Manufacturing and to reduce cost. There is no adverse effect on finished product.  RECOMMENDATION: Remove filter flavors from all full price non-menthol Ultra Light styles with the exception of NOW (NOW will be considered under separate  evaluation). With the same filter specification change, optimize the plasticizer tevel -  in the filter.  RISK ASSESSMENT: All of the Ultra Light styles under consideration use the same blend. Products have been tested by the expert panel and are not significantly different when containing either E235, E240, E249, or no flavor. Additionally, this material change provides greater flexibility and reduced waste in Manufacturing.  Plasticizer optimization has no adverse effect on the filter and will allow gearing consolidation on the filter makers.  COST IMPLICATIONS: For the entire group of products, the cost savings for filter flavor elimination and plasticizer optimization is $72,000 annualized.  SbIT BPZTS __label__Report

It is, of course, veld known thet carbon monazide hae a strong affinity for hemoglabin and displaces oxygen from oxy~ hemoglobin, However, according te current texts and other medical writing, thia ie a revereible reaction. The amount of carbon monoxide combined at any point in time is determined by the propertion of oxyyen to carbon monoxide in the environment. This ia the basia for the use of oxygen in treating carbon monoxide poisoning; thus promating the rapid elimination of carbon monoxide and speeding recovery.

BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION  iat West Hill Stovet +P 0. Box 35000-Lawierite, Kentucky 20292  January 16, 1978  Mr. T. R. Keniston 990 Forest St... Denver, CO 80220  Dear Mr. Keniston: -- - - _-  Thank you very much for your letter concerning our FACT advertising. We realize that the proper grammatical construction is "I smoke only  .. FACTS" but feel that it does not portray the proper conviction that  our copy line conveys. In order to personalize the choice of brand  to the model being presented in the ad, we have chosen the line “I'm realistic" and "I only smoke FACTS." Ses bet : Since the subject of the advertisement i is FACT cigarettes and only FACT cigarettes, it goes well beyond the connotation of the ad to imply that the only thing the model does is enjoy our brand of cigarettes. Our marketing research indicates that consumers reading this adver- tisement appear to receive exactly the intended connotation in the communication - that is, that the model portrayed has made an informed judgment on his brand of cigarettes and has chosen "to smoke only FACTS." Our feeling is that the American public has come to understand over the years that advertisements typically assume "poetic license" in order to convey their selling messages and further feel that they can make a dichotomy between advertising use of language and the exactly proper grammatical construction.  Again, thank you for your letter and we hope that, if you are a smoker, you will try cur FACTS and see if you do not agree that they deliver atypically good taste for a low 'tar' cigarette.

Eichorn Subject: . . Review of Manuscript - "Influence des! Proprietes de Surface des Charbons sur la Filtration de la Fumee de Cigarettes" by C. Jeanneret, U. Nyffeler, C. Mayor, M.-F. Sauser reece  This paper has been reviewed in detail and'I have the following comments to make:  In terms of scientific merit, this paper is not a significant: cor Se Blears contribution. However, it has been presented previously at CORESTA and, in our opinion, does not deal with any material detrimental to our company's business. It does not do much to improve the scientific image of our company. However, there is every reason to believe it is scientifically accurate. \" As with many publications, the title promises more than is — delivered in the paper. The title leads one to expect to learn what the effects of the properties of carbon have on cigarette smoke filtered through carbon. The major portion of the paper deals with a description of the properties of carbon with only limited information on the effect of charcoal on cigarette smoke (analysis of cysteine), In addition, it is not clear what specific : type of charcoal was the final subject of their study.  A major weak point relates to tables 1 and 2. The last. entries in these tables refer to the heat of absorption of the two char- coals studied. The figures reflect results from two different methods of measurement. The results. differ significantly to which only a passing reference is made.  There should be an explanation or at least speculation as to why these figures differ. I believe the authors in other work on heat of absorption of charcoal have made direct calorimetric measure- ments. Reference could be made to this point and’ results from such studies used to explain the differences in the tabulated measurements,  I9SPESSTOOT __label__Memo

Tobacco Institute  FROM: John Chwat  DATE: February 21, 1997  It was a pleasure talking with you about our mutual efforts to cxiend our clients special interests throughout the United States. And, J appreciate the opportunity to tell you about an exciting project we developed for the National Licensed Beverage Association (NLBA). When we spoke, I mentioned that our firm has taken the lead, on behalf of the NLBA, to establish new NLBA state affiliates and to build their  membership. The name of this project is Campaign 2000. Because of our contacts within the hospitality industry, we have been very successful in our efforts to establish new state affiliates. At the beginning of Campaign 2000 (July 1, 1995), the NLBA represented 18 states. As of the first of January ‘97, they represent 29 states. And, we have 8 other states in various stages of the NLBA affiliation process. I'll give you a mo- down for cach state, later in this memo.  While we have added approximately 2,000 new members to the NLBA rolls, the pace of our membership recruitment has been less than meteoric. As you can imagine, the membership recruitment portion of Campaign 2000 is pick-and-shovel work that requires people and funds. Typically, our new state affiliates have a small cadre of people, but, understandably, no start-up funds. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation. Despite iny limited. budget, I try to help where I can with brochures, literature and press releases. However, mailing lists, labels, postage, design work for state affiliate logo’s and application forms, are often beyond the new slate affiliates financial capabilily. Accordingly, they are only able to do a limited amount of membership recruitment. While I expect the pace to speed-up over the next several months, J Temain concerned that the organizing groups may not be in a position to fully exploit a recent development that will make NLBA membership especially attractive to retailers who offer music (live and mechanical), and/or television broadcasts.

ATTACHMENT IV  MARKET: Totedo MANAGER: Curtis Clingman  VAN SAMPLING PROGRAM VAN PERSONNEL  You are to screen and hire one female distributor to work with the Van Manager. One distributor will work with the Van Manager for each day he is in the market. Your distributor will be responsible for traveling with the Van Manager to each site and giving samples to pedestrians (1 per person). The Distributor must not give samples to anyone in cars, to anyone who appears to be under the age of 21, and must always ask if the consumer is a smoker before offering a sample. The Van Manager will have with him uniforms (sizes 8 - 10) and sampling baskets.  VAN SITES  You must identify and schedule three distribution sites per day for the van. These sites should include parks, shopping malls with parking lots, picnic areas, concerts or other recreational facilities. Please be certain that the van will not need a permit to sample or play music at these sites. In essence, the Van Manager will be under your direction for the days he's in your market. The Van will proceed to each site, play music, and distribute samples. Written permission must be obtained to sample on private property such as shopping malls.  In some markets, the client's local representatives have pre-planned special events for the van to sample. In this case, there is no need for you to schedule any additional sites for the van to sample on special event day. (See attached Execution Calendar). For these events, you'll need to provide the Van Manager with 2 or 3 distributors, depending on estimated attendance at the events, which allows the van to distribute a 2 day (if using distributors) allocation. This eliminates 2 or 3 days of sampling activity. However, the van will still make site visits on the remaining days to play music.  PRODUCT & PREMIUMS  In all markets, the product for the Van Manager will be with the local client representative, The Van Manager will have all the information needed to retrieve the product on his first day in the market, and be responsible for it throughout the four days of executions. The Van Manager will distribute premiums along with cigarettes in each market, The premiums will be forwarded to you via UPS.  EL, FEO __label__Report

Data: 23 August 1989  From: .Karen Sanders Subject: .Examination of Centrifuged Boehmite  Two samples of Boehmite, precipitated sol-gel, batch 001, were received. One of the samples, labelled product, had been centrifuged, dried and ground. The other sample was the feed sol-gel prior to centrifugation.  Both samples were mounted on carbon stubbs with carbon paint and  examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backscatter electron microscopy.  The purpose of this examination was to determine if any metal flakes from the stainless steel centrifuge vessel were present within the product. Backscatter SEM was used to locate these since it affords the ability to selectively view differences in atomic number elements within a sample.  This is demonstrated by Figure 1 where a small piece of a stainless steel razor blade was examined to serve as a control.  The feed sol-gel sample examined showed no metal (Figures 2-3). Energy dispersive x-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was then used on the product te determine if there was a high concentration of metals present. Al, the  constituent of the sol-gel, was the only element detected (Figure 4).  The product was then subjected to backscatter SEM. No metal flakes were noted within the sample examined (Figures 5-8).  Katin S an hipea  co: Routing copy to: S$. Baldwin B. Ferguson B. Rogers J. Charles V. Baliga B. Geiszler T. Sanders P. Gauvin G.

Surely we look for more than 600-800 cards from the survey of California's “industry personnel", which are discussed in item I entitled "Industry Inventory." I should think the Industry would be defined broadly enough to garner several hundred thousand names. Perhaps there needs to be a hard core of 600-800 and, on top of that, a contact group on which we have names and addresses number- ing in the hundreds of thousands. But all of this should be in the statewide tobacco action network.  My best regards.

RJR DIRECT MARKETING POLICIES/PROCEDURES  List Management  The following outlines the steps taken by RJR to reduce, to the point of elimination, the likelihood that someone under 18 (the legal age to smoke in virtually all states) will receive product or promotional items from us through the mail.  ¢ -Minimum Age - It is important to remember.that we only mail.to smokers who are 21 years of age or older. We do not mail to smokers of legal age who are younger than 21, ie., smokers who are 18-20 years of age. We think this builds in a margin of safety.  In addition, we attempt to verify the age of 21-24 year old smokers on our list using _ two independent third-party sources. We do this quarterly. The third party vendors have established strict matching criteria which ensures the quality of the matches. - When a name is matched by an outside source, the smoker's record is flagged as verified. Those names sent but not matched are flagged as sent. Any smokers determined by the third party sources to be less than 21 years of age are immediately removed from our list. Those names confirmed to be over 21 and those who are not found at all in the independent databases are retained in our database.  ¢ Smoker Certification - We believe that our mailing list only contains smokers who are 21 years of age or older. We mail these smokers coupons and our own brand  preference screeners. However, we only mail sample product.and promotional items .  to people who have signed a form that certifies: - They are a smoker, - They are 21 years of age or older; and,  - They want to receive offers from us.  Our certification regimen is the most strict in the tobacco industry. We require a smoker to actively insert his or her birth date on the certification form. We feel this added involvement is another way of making the smoker sensitive to what he or she is doing. :  Further, our form paints out that giving false information in order to take advantage of an offer may constitute a crime (mail fraud). We think that most people are honest, but this reminder provides an additional safeguard.  All screeners, comment cards, MGM's, order forms, and other communication that ask a smoker to respond include the standard smoker certification — certification copy, signature line, and birth date line.  Our system is designed to allow us to quickly retrieve a smoker's signed certification. We have a seven year retention policy for smoker certifications. Typically, we can retrieve certifications signed within the past 12 months in 48 hours — no more than 10 working days upon request. Older certifications may take longer to retrieve -- about three weeks. Routine audits are conducted to test our certification storage/retrieval procedures.

RJR Interoffice Memorandum Scientific Affairs Division  TO: Cc. D. McGee  FROM: Ms. Barbara Collie Dr. J. H. Reynolds  DATE: September 18, 1991  SUBJECT: Prototype with Natural Chocolate Flavor #601442  Scientific Affairs understands you wish to conduct panel testing on a full-flavor prototype (966C) using Natural Chocolate Flavor #601442 from the Hagelin Company. The chocolate will be used in the burley casing at a level of 0.29% of the total blend. Approximately 30 panelists will be testing one prototype each which has a WINSTON KS configuration with a '‘'tar' level of 16 mg/cigarette.  Scientific Affairs approves the use of this flavor for the panel evaluation as described above. Since all ingredients are currently in use by RJRT, you do not need to go to the HRRC prior to going to panel. However, should this flavor be further tested  in any other type of sensory evaluation or test market, Scientific Affairs should be consulted. Additional review may be necessary, based upon your proposed conditions of use.  Barbone: b Coble  xc: Dr. A. W. Hayes Dr. R. L. Suber Dr. D. C. Rees Ms. D. L.

September 9, 1980  Mr. D. H. Murphy  RE: M2 CREATIVE FOCUS GROUPS     The following summarizes the findings from the M2 Creative Focus Groups conducted in Dallas on August 25-28. A more comprehensive report of findings is expected from the group moderator the week of September 15th.  BACKGROUND  Research efforts to date have indicated that Virginia Slims smokers are perceived to be most like the desired perceptions  of the M2 target (independent, self-confident, action-oriented). The major deficit associated with Virginia Slims smokers is  the perception of not being warm/friendly. This deficiency results in a number of M2 target women perceiving Virginia Slims smokers. to be "pushy, plastic, uncaring".  Initial creative efforts for M2 included a range of alternative  executions from "product-as-hero" to total imagery approaches. However, it was not known whether these executions projected the independence, self-confidence, active orientation desired by the target, while retaining the elements of warmth/friendli-  ness.  OBJECTIVES  In order to be retained for further consideration as an M2 executional approach, test executions were to project the following:  1. Women shown in the ads must be perceived as independent, self-confident, action-oriented individuals who are also warm and friendly.  2. Executions must maintain some tie to the SALEM "High Country" ads, but be seen as different enough to communi-  cate that M2 is a new brané.  GROUP COMPOSITION  Six group sessions were conducted among female smokers of 100mm menthol brands. Two groups were comprised of Virginia Slims          GETOS  COTE  t __label__Letter

Normally we would not act unless there is widespread damage and victims numbering in the thousands. Were we to respond, we would need to have the particulars (tax 1.D., address, contact, phone, etc.) for the grantee. Also, we would probably check with the Red Cross to see what the needs are so we do not duplicate. Finally, we could consider a shipment of food from Kraft.

TEXAS PRESS CLIPPING BLREAU DALLAS  Pvteiiedag fun  MIDLAND, TX REPORTER- TELEGRAM Circ. D, 23,467 Aba 15 8%     ans ——  Penske stages sweep     By Tim Puet Associated Press Writer  LEXINGTON, Ohio — Ai Unser Jr. led a Team Penske sweep of the first three positions in Sunday's Miller Genu- ine Draft 200, which turned on a stop- and-go penalty against his teammate Paul Tracy.  The third Penske team member, Em- erson Fittipaldi, who won here in 1992  @ Miller 200  and last year, was third. Robby Gordon finished fourth and Michael Andretti ifth,  Tracy, who had led all but one lap, was penalized by CART officials for passing Gordon under a yellow caution flag on lap 53. The penalty forced Tracy to make an extra pit stop, then immedi- ately return to the race course.  The pass occurred on the second turn of the track in a narrow area known as the keyhole. Teo Fabi, driving for the Midiand-based Hall Racing Team had stalled his car and was off the course with a tow truck blocking part of the racing surface.  Tracy’s brakes apparently locked when he tried to slow down. So did the brakes on Gordon’s car, which slid side- ways, allowing Tracy to get past him along the inside of the track. Gordon quickly recovered and got back into the racing line in front of Unser.  “T wasn't planning on passing him, but he locked up his brakes and almost slid off the track, What am I supposed to do? He slipped wide,’' Tracy said of Gordon.  Tracy said that he tried to talk with CART officials, “but they didn’t want to hear anything about it.”  { Tracy held the lead until he made a  se     AP Laserphoto  IndyCar driver Al Unser Jr. «deading Penske Team to sweep  regular pit stop on the 57th lap, when Unser took first place. Unser pitted one lap later, and Tracy made his penalty stop at the same time, allowing Unser to hold a seven-second lead.  Tracy, who qualified second, slipped past Unser on the first lap and, until the penalty, lost the lead only when he pit- ted on the 29th. Fittipaldi took first at that point, but pitted on the next lap to put Tracy back in front.     Tt was Unser’s sixth victory in the 11”  Indy-car races this season and his fourth from the pole position, with the others coming al the Indianapolis 500 and the Portland and Cleveland road races, It also was his first triumph in 42 tries at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car course.  In addition, it was the eighth triumph for the IImor engines of Team Penske. Tracy and Fittipaldi have won once apiece,  Unser averaged 110.387 mph for 83 laps, or 185.8 miles over the 2%-mile, 13- turn road course. The race originally was scheduled for 89 laps, but was shortened to meet ABC-TV require- ments, CART spokesman Dave Etshoff said.  }  98078S¢20z __label__News

Burke Vice President Law & General Counsel  DATE: May 26, 1994  RE: Retain_All Documents  Under an order in litigation, the Company is required to retain literally all documents regarding certain subjects.  Effective immediately, Brown & Williamson employees are required to retain indefinitely all documents relating to (1) the manufacturing, testing and composition of tobacco, tobacco products, paper, filter or any other material contained in, relating to or used in the manufacture, testing and composition of tobacco products or (2) the nicotine content of tobacco, tobacco products (cigarettes, pipe tobacco, smoking  tobacco, smokeless tobacco, filler, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tohacco, etc.) and cigarette smoke.  Please note that this requirement under the court order overrides the provisions of our Records Management Program. One effect of overriding the Program is that the order requires us to retain relevant copies and temporary documents. The other effect concerns electronic documents. we  Under the order, the term “document” means every form of recorded information, whether handwritten or printed, and including electronic information as follows:  videotape . . . phonograph record, tape record, mechanical or electronic sound recording or transcript thereof, retrievable data (whether carded, taped, coded, electrostatically or electromagnetically recorded, or otherwise), or other data compilation from which information can be obtained, including (but not limited to) . . . computer storage tapes, computer storage cards or discs... .  Thus, all such electronic information that is relevant to the subject matter is required to be retained indefinitely. If you have any questions about how to save electronic information, please call MIS.  For your information, the litigation involved is the Castano case in Louisiana. As you may know from media reports, a group of plaintiffs law firms has filed a complaint alleging a class action against the industry on behalf of smckers who claim to be addicted. Plaintiffs obtained an order which froze the companies’ documents at a time when Brown & Williamson was not a party to the case and there are good arguments that the order does not apply to us. After careful consideration, we have decided that the best course for the Company is to comply,  F.A .B.  /sa  566930064 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Memo

You are listed there as being an american Cancer Society Professor of Cellular and Developmental Biology and that is mentioned again. in the introduction (see enclosed). While the Society is very grateful for your using your American Cancer Society title in publications and public appearances and the like, it is not. appropriate, it seems to us, to have it listed with the Council for Tobacco Research. For our staff and volunteers this is a conflict of interest--that at least is the perception. These are the people that bring us products that Kill a half million Americans a year, and for the American Cancer Society to be in any way associated with the Council for Tobacco Research lends it credibility that is  frankly embarrassing.  ~ ~  We certainly recognize that the members of the Scientific Advisory Board are a distinguished group of people who are making sincere efforts on behalf of research. Please don’t take this  . request personally, put I hope you understand the sensitivity that” we have to this issue of tobacco and cancer. They are not very  broad minded when it comes to dealing with some investigators that  are funded by the American Cancer Society who provide information which they don’t like--in fact, the tobacco companies have severely pressured several scientists funded by the Society.

PB ES FOOT  GRANT APPLICATION No. 814A  Subject: Una S. Ryan, Ph.D., Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute, Miami, Florida, Continudtion application “Endocrine Functions of the Lungs"  This is an imaginative proposal, with some preliminary work already accom plished to indicate feasibility, for demons trating cellular localization of “converting enzyme", This enzyme has been shown both to. deactivate bradykinin and, contrarily, to activate angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Both of these activities are part of the nor-respiraetory functions of the lung, which in this instance is shown to be a hormonal control organ capablé of affecting distant, in fact general, function. Dr. Ryan presents evidence to support her claim that the deactivation proceeds in the "caveolae" of endothelium of small pulmonary vessels, and that this is a totally new mechanism of hormonal inacti-  vation; this last can be argued.  The methods to be applied are immunocytochemical localization. For this purpose special procedures of conjugating microperoxidase with antibody to converting enzyme will be applied te specially fixed morsellated lung tissue in vitro.     Critique:  The procedures outlined are eppropriate and represent an interesting confluence of powerful biochemical and immunological methods. Oblique refer- ence is made at several points to smoking, and to other work on localization of nicotine and metabolites to cells, also progressing in this laboratory. It is quite possible that smoking may affect an enzymic deactivation process in the lig of certain important hormones. This proposal in away can be considered as preparatory for such investigations at a basic level. It is, however, unnecessary for actual practical investigation of converting enzymes in the lung.

Reynolds Boulevard  Winston Salem, North Carolina 27105  Dear Dr. O'connor:  I have cut and pasted the most relevant abstracts from what was left of the search on ultrasonic extrusion after ordering several papers which seemed most relevant.  There was much redundancy; I have tried to select descriptive, represen- tative abstracts that represent the whole.  In brief, ultrasound applied appropriately to a forming device (press, extruder, drawing device, etc.) does have a measurable positive effect upon a formikp operation. This effect may be: decreased friction (in- creased die life); increased extrusion speed; better surface appearance, better uniformity; or combinations of these, taken so that the product is better when ultrasound is used then when it is not persent.  |  I'm sure there are trade offs among these several effects, and I'm also  sure that the effect upon the quality and economics of forming the fuel {  source must be evaluated for the project at hand.  The attached four pages of abstracts will give the reader a feeling  for this applied technology, most of which dates from the 1960's and 70's  but originated in the late 50's. ~  ;  {  I hope this abstraction of abstracts is helpful.  ped Vieere  .

SUBJECT: 1983 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT  REPORT ON SMOKING AND HEALTH  You have received earlier reports of Institute activity to  meet the 1983 report. This is a supplement to them.  1.  2  A letter from me, with supporting enclosures (see attached sample) was delivered prior to publication of the report to each member of Congress.  The staff recontacted reporters and news bureau chiefs, who had undergone staff briefings earlier,-to provide them in person with copies of the "executive summary" of our position on smoking and heart disease (copy attached).  Following the Brandt-Koop news conference last Thursday at 11, 22 news organizations sought TI response and were given our brief statement (copy attached). (There were 31 other media inquiries the same day about the "Great American Smokeout" and our staff response to that is also attached).  Major media coverage was thorough but not flamboyant or "front-page." The New York Times used a UPI story, in section D. The Washington Post ran its own story, on page 3. The Wall Street Journal had a modest, inside story. USA Today gave the report three paragraphs at the end of a short story on the "Smokeout." On evening TV news broadcasts Thursday, ABC covered the story in 100 seconds, CBS 135 seconds, and NBC 110. All had TI's comments, and  the Times, UPI, the Journal and CBS used them.  Last Friday, we prepared and distributed (for Sunday release) a further, hard-hitting and specific rebuttal statement (copy attached).  CONFIDENTIAL: MINNESOTA TOBACCO LITIGATION oe ee __label__Memo
By William Safire  WASHINGTON, May 15—Carmine DeSapio, boss of Tammany Hall a gen- eration ago, abolished the smoke- filled room uring his tenure as leader because his eyes were sensitive to smoke.  Im that sense at jeast. Mr. DeSapio ds regarded as a prophet without honor tn his own time by members of 2 mew organization. one fiercer and rrore self-righteous than the old Tiger of Tammany: the Group Against Smok- ers’ Pollution (GASP).  Across the nation, GASP chapters have been formed to help shame the 52 million American smokers into re- fraining from indulging their habit in the “breathing space” of nonsmokers.  “Nonsmokers have rights tco” is the slogan of GASP and in its “libera- tion guide” there are tips to members about methods to discomfit those whe discomfort them. Some ideas are forthright—"Speak out against smok- ing!*"—while others are maddening, such as “Discourage smoking by not providing ashtrays.”  So far, so good: In an enclosed space, people who are annoyed by tobacco smoke should make known their irritation to smokers, who should then have the courtesy to desist. Un- fortunately. that is not the last GASP: Buoyed by their success in getting air- Hines to segregate smokers, the non- smokers are pressing their attack with demands for government regulatior. of “breathing space.”  From Barry Goldwater's Arizona to George McGovern’s South Dakota. states have passed laws prohibiting smoking in museums. concert halls, theaters, libranes and elevators. This morning. New York City’s Board of Health is scheazied to act on a pro-  NOTICE IF THE FILM IMAGE IS LESS CLEAR  THAN THIS NOTICE.  IT IS DUE TO THE  QUALITY OF THE DOCUMENT BEING FILMED.  On Puffery  ESSAY  posal to compel the segregation of smokers from nonsmokers in most public places, including restaurants.  This is a good example of the tyr- anny of the minority. A little group of willful persons, representing no opinion but thtir own, has rendered the great smoking public helpless and contemptible.  “Where a fire or health hazard exists, nobody disputes that smoking should     de prohibited. But despite the fuming”  of former Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld, no evidence exists to sug- gest that the exhaled smoke of other persons poses a health hazard to non- smokers. A tiny minority is acutely allergic to smoke, and its wishes need to be considered, but public policy ought not to be set to accommodate today’s Carmine DeSapios.  The cigarette smoker is already the target of too many Government agen- cies. He cannot be advertised to on television; he must carry around on every pack a dire warning about kill- ing himself; he is taxed regressively and punitively.  Yet the smoker continues to smoke; in the United States last year, 588 billion cigarettes were puffed, dragged upon and choked over, and thanks to the growing interest in smoking by teen-age girls, the market continues te grow,  This perverseness—the refusal of people to do what is gond for them — activates the antismoking brigade, | think, even more than the annovance caused by the exhalation of the coffin- nailers. If smokers do not respond to reason. to wamings, to the silencing of advertising, to tax disincentives, then perhaps the only way is to make it more difficult to find a place to Nght up.  New York Tines $/16/7L  >. ll  “You are not denying the smoker's right to smoke,” GASP assures its members, “only his/her right to smoke in your breathing space.” Not true; any harassment, especially harassment by executive regulations, is part of «  process that infringes our liberties and  poliutes our statute books.  Today the smoker, tomorrow the  onion-eater, and the day after tomor- Tow the person who prefers cheap perfume to the taking of baths: once Government gets its nose under the tent of social intercourse, there will be no privacy for anyone,  The bossism of the do-gooder is intolerable, even when he/she (fight linguistic pollution) clooks paternal- ism in the guise of selfishness. Not every social inequity needs a legal cure: social, not government, pressure is appropriate to curb the smoker. A giare, a sniff, and if necessary the green-gilled appearance of the onset of motion sickness, should be enough to get a smoker to stub out his butt in a hurry.  T gave up smoking two years ago and it is like Josing a friend, I don’t feel any better, and am not inclined to badger others into sacrificing one of life’s little pleasures. What incenses some people is incense to me; blow some my way.  But the abuse of the power of health agencies to put a governmental fist into the glove of social courtesies is worrisome. A new law separating smoking from nonsmoking areas in Testaurants would invite a smoker's Sit-in at a nonsmoking lunch counter, turning the civil-rights clock back by decades.  in their zeal, the people from GASP have gone too far. we can now look forward to the formation of “People United to Fight for Freedom by Figh:- ing Fire With Fire” (PUFFF).

The costs are as follows:  Item Quantity Cost Per Unit Total Cost 10 1/2" Vinyl Decal 6,600 $7.25 $47,850 3 Piece Mobile 6,000 $5.38 $32,280  The cost per unit listed above is based on a quantity of 2,500. Therefore, the actual cost per unit will probably be slightly lower.  As you are aware, mechanicals for the decal, mobile and dummy pack are currently being developed by Bob DeBlasio. Receipt of the decal and mobile mechanicals are expected by July, 24, 1995.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions!  Kp  ce: A, Sadovnick C. Humphrey C. Lucente j. Tatulli K.

SN heme meee  17  Sr     EVANSVILLE, IND:  _ COURIER S. 102,526  D; 63;527 - EVANSVILLE METROPOLITAN AREA  Than  JUN     Operating under what if calls its “fairness” policy, the Federal Communications Commission has ordered TV and radio stations to provide time for rebuttal to cigaret commercials.  The FCC didn’t go so far as to require “equal time” as in political eampaigns: But it sald the broad- casters must give “substantial” al- fowances to people who say cigarets are bad for you.  The stations, the FCC ruled, have a “duty” to inform their audiences of the “other slide of his controversial issue.”  This is the first time the FCC ever has. insisted on rebuttals to commercials, and this ruling is re- stricted to cigaret advertising, But  wwe can imagine a goog many other        en ee  Something Smoking Here  argue about — and the FOC may have let itself into a can of singing worms,  When, for example, are the Indians on all these westerns going to get a fair shake? How about something to offset that dizzy blond who keeps screeching ut us to join a “rebellion?” Shouldn't there be something like “equal time” for the otherwise healthy fellow who gets sick watching what those pills do to that stomach? There are gents who don’t like deodorants, even if the  ‘ girls would come running, as the  commercials say. Any “fairness” for them?  _ if we are going to be 60 all- fired fair, why not be “fair” with everybody?  be2ze0SO0Tr         mS STAR  D. 221,489 s SG oehe _ » 34 uot ~ INDIANAPOLIS méropotnen ee o :     JUN 7 19  Big Brother At Work  What will our lives be like when the government regulates them completely? Take a look at the Federal Communications Commission's ruling on answers to cigarette advertising on radio and télevision, and use your imagination.  The commission has ordered that cigarette advertis- ing on the air must be answered with antismoking prop- aganda broadcast by thé same stations.  If the station can find sponsors to pay for the time, they're lucky. If they can’t, the time must be provided free.  The order was issued, the commission said, under its “fairness doctrine.” This is a long-standing require- ment that radio and television stations offer fair cover- age of conflicting points of view on controversial issues.  Hitherto the application of the fairness doctrine has only requiréd comparable tréatment of the two or more sides of an issué. And éxcépt in (he casé of political campaigns, which come under a special law, it has never been applied to paid commercials at all.  So this is the first instance in which stations have been ordered to provide free timé for answers to paid advertisements. This is an audacious ruling, to say the least. ,  The controversy in this case is about the effects of smoking on health. The FCC took note of the fact that govérnméntal and privaté reséarch organizations have asserted that “normal use” of cigarettes may be in- jurious to health. People who see and hear cigarette commercials on the air should also be told about these assertions, said the FCC. So it’s up to the stations to see that it’s done. :  Where do we go from here? There are plenty of other controversies about things which are advertised, involving health, safety and well-being: Now that the FCC has entered the field of judging these matters, the possibilities are endless.  Note well also the FCC fs legislating—it is overrul- ing Congress. Congress enacted a law requiring that a warning of the possible injury to health be printed on cigarette packages: It specifically said in that law that inclusion of thé warning in cigarette advertising shall not be required. The FCC, in requiring thé warning in answer to advertising, is certainly countermanding the intent of Congress.  This order is a horrible example of tha unbridled use of government regulatory power.     ‘ l                    gt __label__News

Lorillard  MEMORANDUM  November 30, 1995 TO: K. Sparrow FROM: K. Fauerbach  SUBJECT: STRATEGY LETTER: 1996 - NEWPORT LIGHTS HEAVY-UP TEST     The fallowing outlines the details for the planned Newport Lights heavy-up test beginning April 8, 1996.  BACKGROUND  In evaluating the Full-Price, Lotar Menthol segment of the marketplace, it appears that there is potential for growth for Newport Lights. Compared to competitive Lights brands, Newport Lights has the third highest volume (Salem and Kool are greater). In addition, the chart below shows that Lights contributes a smaller percentage of business to the overall Newport franchise than our competitors.  % OF FRANCHISE     Marlboro  Newport Kool Salem Menthol Full Flavor 89 717 53 38 Lights 11 23 47 62  Newport is a heavily Urban Center driven brand, while its key competition is either more evenly split between General Market and Urban Center, or is. General Market driven. This creates a disadvantage for Newport Lights, because the Lotar Menthol category is heavily dominated by the General Market. Since Newport Lights is underdeveloped vs. this target audience, we feel that there may be an opportunity to build Newport Light’s business by increasing the brand’s presence in the 3eneral Market.  Therefore, starting April 8, 1996, we will implement a Newport Lights heavy-up test in two test markets. The objective of the program is to determine business building opportunities for Newport Lights in the General Market. The test will strive to increase brand awareness and marketplace presence by utilizing a combination of a distribution drive and increased/specialized marketing support in the form of Advertising and Promotion.

The weaknesses and deficiencies I see could probably be muliti- plied 10-fold by a professional statistician or  epidemiologist.  Data necessary for a true evaluation of the  article are lacking. The journal in which it ap- pears is issued by an organizetion well-known for  its antismoking bias; also, the journal is almost  a “trade organization" publication. You'll note there's no mention of the wine (or other) drink- ing habits of the subjects.  You might want to send a copy to PMI in Laue sanne. I'm not sure whether the French industry group in Paris, Association de Fournisseurs Com- munautaire de Cigarettes, has seen it. I did know its director, Mme.

The “incontrovertible” evidenc fered by this group holds that ciga smokers are far more susceptible to cancer than those who do not smoke srettes. This ‘bit of study from this partic study group follows similarly “incoi vertible” evidence from a previous g that there was no proyable relation tween cigarette smoking and lung ca That report, in turn, followed a previou port that cigarettes did cause lung ca! That's the way it seems to go.  Some cigaretts smokers ‘will arop habit or cut it muteriaily on the basis of Jatest report.

Regarile: the reports, a lot of cigarette smokers go right ahead feeling that when the: go much smoke nobody knows where fire may be.  The situation has been reached w the average layman finds himself spin around amid “incontrovertible” rep each contradicting the other.

Complexes of Ras-GTP with Raf-1 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase  Shonna A. Moodie,* Berthe M. Willumsen, Michael J. Weber, Alan Wolfman  ‘The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)—binding protein Ras functions in regulating growth and differentiation; however, little is known about the protein interactions that bring about its biological activity. Wild-type Ras or mutant forms of Ras were covalently attached to an insoluble matrix and then used to examine the interaction of signaling proteins with Ras. Forms of Ras activated either by mutation (Gly12Val) or by binding of the GTP analog, guanylyl-imidodiptiosphate (GMP-PNP) interacted specifically with Raf-1 whereas an ef- fector domain mutant, lle36Ala, failed to interact with Raf-1. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activity was only associated with activated forms of Ras. The specific interaction of activated Ras with active MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) was confirmed by direct assays. Thus the forming of complexes containing MAPKK activity and Raf-1 protein  are dependent upon the activity of Ras.     The majority of cellular Ras in quiescent cells is in the inactive guanosine diphos- phate (GDP)-bound. conformation. Stimu- lation of cells with mitogens or differentia- tion factors increases the abundance of the active GTP-bound form of Ras (1). The activity of Ras is required for regulatory signaling by plasma membrane tyrosine ki- nase oncogenes and receptors (2). Blocking the action of Ras, either by microinjection of antibodies or through the expression of a dominant negative mutant, prevents the activation of the cytosolic serine-threonine protein kinases Raf-1 and MAP kinase (3, 4). The expression of activated Ras, either in whole cells or in vitro activates thesc cytosolic serine-threanine protein kinases  §. A. Moodie and A. Wolfman, Oepartment of Cell Biology, Cleveland Clinic foundation, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106.  8. M. Willumsen, Institute of Microbiology, University of Copenhagen, @ster Farimagsgade 24, OK 1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.  M. J.-Weber, Department of Microbiology, Health  Sciences Centre, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908.  *To whom correspondence should be addressed  1658  (5-7). These cytosolic enzymes can func- tion as part of a kinase cascade, in which MAP kinases are activated by a MAPKK (8), which in turn can be phosphorylated and activated by the Raf-1 protein kinase (9). The components of this pathway may not always be coupled to each other, how- ever, because neither Ras or Raf-1 activates MAP kinases in Ratla cells (10).  Though it is clear that Ras participates in signaling between the cell membrane and the cytosol, the biochemical interac- tions that mediate the action of Ras are poorly understood. To determine if Ras might physically interact with cytosolic signaling components in a GTP-depen- dent manner, we covalently bound recom- binant c-Ha-Ras (referred to as Ras) to silica beads activated by an N-hydroxyl succinimide group (11, 12). The coupled Ras was active in binding guanine nucle- otides and has been used to examine interactions between Ras and neurofbro- min, a regulator of Ras function (12). The immobilized Ras was used to probe rat brain cytosol for signaling proteins that  SCIENCE * VOL. 260 * 11 JUNE 1993  50648850  specifically interacted with Ras-GTP. Immobilized Ras bound to GMP-PNP. (a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) formed a sta- ble complex with Raf-1 (Fig. 1A). Approx- imately 15% of the total cytosolic Raf-1 associated with immobilized Ras-GMP- PNP. The transforming Ras mutant,” Ras¥#!!2 bound to GMP-PNP, was about 10% as effective as wild-type Ras in forming stable complexes with Raf-1 (Fig. LA). An  even. smaller amount of Raf-1 associated with the GDP-bound form of Ras¥#4?, A form, of Ras with a mutation in the effector domain, Ras*'36, bound to either GDP or GMP-PNP failed to bind detectable amounts of Raf-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the stable association of Raf-1 with immobilized Ras correlated well with the formation of the active GTP-bound form of Ras.  We investigated the GTP-dependent as- sociation of Ras with MAPKK and MAP kinase, which have been reported to func- tion downstream of Raf-1. Immunoprecipi- tates of MAP kinase from the rat brain lysate did not catalyze the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the pres- ence of {y-**Pladenosine triphosphate (ATP) (13). This enabled us to use the activation of endogenous MAP kinase ac- tivity as an assay for MAPKK. Incubation of cytosolic proteins bound to immobilized Ras:GMP-PNP with ATP produced soluble kinase activity with a high substrate speci- ficity for MBP as compared with cither histone or casein (Fig. 2A) (14). The sol- uble kinase activity was also detected with  Fig. 1. Association of Raf-1 with immobilized Ras. (A) Lysate was in- cubated with immabi- lized Ras-GDP {lane 1}, Ras-GMP-PNP (jane 2}, Ras’*"?-GDP (lane. 3), or Ras¥#!?-GMP-PNP (lane 4) for 60 min at 4°C (15); 2x Laemmli sample buffer was add- ed to the sedimented material and the eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS-PAGE}, transferred, and immunoblotted with a rabbit polycional antibody to Raf-1. The position of Raf-1 is denoted by the arrow. (B) As in (A) except that lysate was incu- bated with immobilized Ras-~GMP-PNP (lane 1), Ras“'935-GDP (lane 2), or Ras*'#26-GMP-PNP (lane 3). Control immunoprecipitation of lysate with the antibody revealed a single band of 68 kD whereas the rabbit non-immune serum did not react with this protein. Quantitation of Raf-1 bound to immobilized Ras was done on a phos- phorimager and expressed as the percentage of Raf-1 protein immunoprecipitated from identical amounts of crude lysate. Comparable amounts of antibody and lysate were used to those in the experiment described in Table 1.  A __label__Scientific

Only someone awakening ‘Feom 40 years of suspended animation could possibly be unaware that tobacco can kill you er that nicotine can be addictive.  Aa evidence of alleged racketeering, the governntent cites a 1988 tobacco trade- group prese release questioning nicotine's addictive qualities. But the evidence shows that most Americans have ignored such doc- uments. The fact ia that the anti-smoking effort has been one of the moat successful public-education campaigny in years. The number of Americans who amoke has fallen 50 percent in the past 26 years.  ere’s also something profoundly disin-  uoua in Washington, following the early lead uf the individual states, suing to re- cover health costs. Ax Robert Bork noted in an enlightening Wall Street Journal article, the states —- thanks to increased taxes —- make more money off the sale of tigurettes than they've spent and are likely to spend on medical costs.  The fact is that anti-tobacco zealots would dearly love to outlaw the sale of the prod- uct, but lack the political clout to do so. Which means that, instead, they'll try to re- caver money made from the sale of a prad- uct that remaina perfectly legal.  Earlier this year, Attorney General Janet Rano wold Congress that the Justice Depart- ment “does not have an independent cause of action” against the tobacce companies.

In the first place, the lawauit ia just the latest prosecutorial abuse of the Racketeer- Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law. This atatute, enacted in 1970, was deggned for a specific purpose: to mve prosecutors a powerful weapon to use against mob kingpins who could not other- wise be connected to specific violent crimes.  RICO has served a useful and highly eifec- tive purpose in the war agsinst organized crime — particularly. when the mob has taken over legitimate businesses. But the statute's broad powera have been misused and abused for overtly political purposes, allowing the government to confiscate alle gedly i. egal profits from unpopular busi- Nesses and organizations.  Thia suit marks the first tire, however, that Washington has targeted an entire in- dustry ay a racheteernng enterprize. It ac- cusas the nation’s tobacco companies of cun- spiring to misiead the public about tobacco's health hazards and nicotine’s addictive  ualities — of undertaking, the government charges, “an intentional, coordinated cam- paign of fraud and deceit.”  But if the tobacco companies have heen Jess than honest about admitting that their        FROM: TO:28@2 659 237 PAGE: 84  i i 1 Hl  9997078202 __label__News

COMMUNICATING ON THE ISSUES  IN 1975, THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE DECIDED TO TRY A LITTLE EXPERIMENT. OVER THE PREVIOUS DECADE, WE HAD BEEN BATTERED BY THE MEDIA. THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT OF 1964 HAD BEEN BIG NEWS. OUTISDE OF THE MAJOR MEDIA IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND NEW YORK CITY, OUR RESPONSE HAD BEEN MUTED. BUT THAT CHANGED WHEN A GROUP OF INSTITUTE EXECUTIVES HIT THE ROAD AND CONDUCTED  MEDIA BREIFINGS IN A SERIES OF CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY.  WHAT WE FOUND WAS GRATIFYING. WE LEARNED THAT THE MEDIA WERE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE HAD TO SAY. THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR NEWS FROM "THE OTHER SIDE." WHAT THEY HAD GOTTEN BEFORE WAS GENERALLY EITHER FROM THE NETWORKS OR WIRE SERVICES. FEW HAD HAD ANY PERSONAL CONTACT WITH A TOBACCO INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE. THEIR REPORTING ON OUR BRIEFINGS WAS GENERALLY FAIR. THAT LEAD US TO CONCLUDE THAT WE NEEDED SOME FULLTIME, PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATORS ON THE STAFF TO CONTINUE CARRYING THE  MESSAGE AROUND THE COUNTRY.  LATER IN 1975, TWO SUCH PEOPLE WERE HIRED. THE NEXT YEAR, OUR COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE ENDORSED AN EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM AND TWO MORE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONALS CAME ON BOARD. THAT IS WHEN I JOINED TI.

UPHOLSTERED  FURNITURE ACTION COUNCIL : Box 2436 cM  High Point, NC 27261 (819) 835-5065  FABRIC CLASSIFICATION TEST METHOD--1990  I. BACKGROUND  To participate in the UFAC Voluntary Action Progran, upholstered furniture manufacturers must agree to produce their furniture in accordance with the basic UFAC construction criteria. In order to identify component materials which meet the UFAC requirements, a test method is needed to define acceptable performance in each criterion.  II. SCOPE  This test method is intended as the means of establishing the performance level of upholstery cover fabrics in contact with polyurethane foam with respect toe cigarette ignition resistance. Fabrics which meet the requirements of this test method may be labelled as UFPAC Class I, and may be used directly over conventional polyurethane in the horizontal seating surfaces of upholstered furniture bearing the UFAC hangtag. All other fabrics are UFAC Class II and require an approved barrier between the cover fabric and conventional polyurethane foam in the horizontal Seating surfaces.  III. GENERAL PROCEDURE  Vertical and horizontal panels of two inch UFAC Standard Polyurethane  Foam substrate are covered, using the fabric to be tested. The panels are placed in three specimen holders and a lighted cigarette is placed in each crevice formed by the abutment of vertical and horizontal panels of each assembly. Each cigarette is covered with a piece of sheeting fabric. The cigarettes are allowed to burn their entire length, unless an obvious ignition occurs. Test measurements and observations are recorded. A minimum of three test specimens are required for each cover  fabric sample to be classified.  TV. DEFINITIONS     1. IGNITION: Continuous, self-sustaining smoldering combustion of upholstered furniture substrates after exposure to burning cigarettes. 2. OBVIOUS IGNITION: Pronounced continuous and self-sustaining  combustion of the test system. Determination is a matter of operator judgement based upon experience in this type of testing. ~  3. SAMPLE: Upholstery cover fabric material being classified.  4. SPECIMEN: Individual piece of sample used in one test assembly.  5. CHAR: Area of fabric which is destroyed or degraded from face to. back, not including the area which is only discolored by smoke.  April 1, 1990  PTP9 ES8OS __label__Report

These substrates; alumina, bauxite, carbon, etc.; allow the aerosol generating and flavor materials to be released slowly. This is evidenced by the fact of discovery of black (carbonized centers) in alumina pellets which have been subjected to smoking conditions and by Ames test activity with these substrates when subjected to high temperature conductive heat. These conditions allow for formation of decomposition products and increased generation of carbon monoxide. In order to provide a larger pore size, substrate materials were formed from aluminum metal mesh and sheet. Larger substrate pore sizes should result in decreased carbon monoxide and decomposition products.  Example 1 - Aluminum wire 200 x 200 mesh, containing .0021" diameter  wire was rolled into a spiral. The beginning size was 5/8" wide x 60 mm long.  GO        o. 0. 07s — 08S  Two of these substrate rods were made and dipped into liquid glycerine at a temperature near the boiling point. One of the rods weighed .1003 g  before dipping and .1820 g after dipping. Thus, .0817 g of glycerine was deposited on the aluminum spiral rod. The other spiral rod weighed .1251  g& before dipping and .2542 g after, thus, .1291 g of glycerine was deposited  on the rod. \ Ak gf /h  SBS 5/1/86  Sie [he Cf ES     OnEL SOS0S __label__Letter

The legislators decided to re-refer the bill to committee because they said it was toa broad the way it was written. They won't bring it back until after Labor Day at the very earliest. Over in Chautauqua County, the legislators will consider exempting cigars and making a "3-foot from the register" exception for smokeless when an amendment is heard in the next month.  This could give cigarette retailers an opportunity to go back in an maybe at least get some space on the the counter--not just behind it. The local Rite-Aid drug chain, with five stores in the county, is mainly pushing for the cigar, smokeless exception.  | RJROO00000507107257  | 70017 8131  O06r Loses __label__Email
February 3, 1960  Mr. W. R. Lybrook:  With reference to the attached letter from Mr. Croce, you can tell him that we do not add any oxidizing agents to our tobaccos and insofar as we know, neither do any of our competitors. Therefore, nothing is added to tobacco to increase the rate of  burning.  Some cigarette papers do contain a very small amount of additive to increase the burning rate of the paper only so that it will burn evenly with the tobacco and prevent cigarettes from "going out".  I am attaching also a photocopy of an article that appeared in TOBACCO concerning "measure-  ment of the combustion-zone temperature of cigarettes". It is to be noted that the combustion-zone temperature  is held within a narrow range regardless of the many variables. Our own work confirms the results which are reported,  I am returning Mr. Croce's letter herewith.     Kenneth H. Hoover  KHH: has  Attachments  OLNL LBLOS __label__Letter
MEMORANDUM January 19, 1976     TO: Mr. J. R. Ave FROM: A. B.. Hudson  SUBJECT: Kent Golden Light Menthol  Based on the information I have obtained’, the extra- polated sales off KGL on an annualized, national basis will be approximately five (5) billion units. It would appear that an unusually good. opportunity to increase the sales impact of this brand will be missed if we do not introduce a KGL Menthol..  The supportive data for this opinion is shown in Tables land 2. These tables list the availllable sales data for brands. that have been introduced since 1966 with a companion menthol. Table 1. shows the sales of competitive products. as reported by Maxwell and Table 2 lists the sales of Lorillard products as reported by Maxwell, except where noted.  As can be seen, the average percent of sales of the menthol products: relative to the non-menthol for the com- petitive brands is 54%, andi for the Lorillard brands 57.6%. Assuming this data would translate if a KGL Menthol was introduced, the anticipated sales of the menthol brand would be approximately two to three billiion units during the first year of introduction.  In evaluating the data shown in the Tables, it should be remembered that one of the most accepted methods: of fore- casting sales trends isi a technique called "exponential smoothing". This simply means: that the most recent data is given the most weight in the forecast. Because off this, any data for brands: introduced before 1966 would be superfluous for this type of forecasting. It can also be seen that if only the brands: which have been introduced recently are considered, then the percent of menthol sales relative to the non-menthol would be greater than 603.

Dr. Murray Senkus April 8, 1970  TOBACCO PROJECTS  I. PUFFED TOBACCO A. Tobacco Studies (Project 185: Fredrickson, Harper, Hickman)  Study of the effect of sucker control agents on ‘the response of tobacco to puffing processes is in progress. Composites of flue-cured tobacco from Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were used. The samples were composites of the leaves from the upper two-thirds of the plant. Compo- sites of burley from Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are also being studied. The sucker control agents are two systemic agents, MH-30 and the potassium salt of maleic hydrazide, and four contact agents, l-octanol, j-decanol, cocodimethylamine caprate, dimethyldodecylamine acetate (Penar). Hand-suckered tobaccos were used as controls. All samples were puffed with pentane/wet steam. All flue-cured samples treated with sucker control agents were more responsive to puffing than the hand-suckered tobacco. However, the increases in the filling value for the treated flue-cured samples were similar. The increases in the intracellular volume measured with an air pycnometer were  more variable. No data are available for the burley sample at present.  The expansion of stalk composites of 15 commercial flue-cured varieties grown at Oxford, North Carolina is in progress.  An exploratory study of the constituents involved in the thermo-plastic deformation of tobacco during expansion has been initiated.  B. Smoke Studies (Project 180: Schumacher, Green)  Study of the particulate phase components of a control and wholly puffed tobacco blend continues. Four of the 10 major chromatographic fractions from the ether extract of each condensate have been investigated; study of a fifth is well underway.

Lewis  Department of Biochemistry, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyo.. USA  Key Words. Adrenal medulla - Peptide, bioactive « Precursor  Abstract. A 24 amino acid polypeptide that does not originate from (pre)proenkephalin has been isolated from ovine adrenal chromaffin granules. ls sequence is: Arg-Leu-Pro-Gly-Glu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Glu-Val-  Gly-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly-Val. This peptide is generate partially sequenced. The proteolytic cleavage occurs at a tri  banks shows very little homology to any known protein.  In the course of our attempts to elucidate the steps in- volved in (pre)proenkephalin processing in both bovine and ovine adrenal medullary cells [for review see ref. 5], we have isolated a number of opioid and nonopiaid peptides derived from proenkephalin [6, 12, 13]. We have also ob- served a number of other peptides whose sequences were not contained in the prohormone sequence [1, 7]. These peptides were present in amounts equal to or greater than the proenkephalin fragments and exhibited no cross-reac- tivity with antisera against Met- and Leu-enkephalin. We present here the purification and sequence of a peptide and its precursor from ovine adrenal chromaffin granules that are not derived from proenkephalin and which may be phy- siologically active peptides secreted by the adrenal me- dulla.  Materials and Methods  Fresh ovine adrenal glands were obtained from the slaughter- house and kept on ice until dissection. Upon removal of the cortex, chromaffin granules were prepared from the medulla by differen- tial centrifugation as described elsewhere [2] and stored at -80°C until further processing. The granules were lysed in | Afacetic acid and 20 mM HCI containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanal (1:5 w/v). Phenylmethane sulfonylfluoride in acetone and pepstatin A in eth- anol (1 g/ml of each) were added as protease inhibitors just prior to lysis. The final supernatant from 40,000 g centrifugation (1 h) of the lysate was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 column a     Received: July 27, 1984 Accepted after revision: November 2, 1984  d from a precursor molecule that has also been purified and ple Arg site.

The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with the Muorescamine postcolumn detection as described by Lewis [9] was used with acetic acid/pyridine buffer (0.5/0.2 Af, pH 4) and I-propanol us the organic modifier at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The conditions for each chromatographic step are provided in the figure legends.  Radioimmuncassays [10] were performed with antiserum ob- tained from [mmunonuclear (Stillwater, Minn., USA) using ['251]- Met- and Leu-enkephalin (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA). Prior to assay, the samples were treated with trypsin (Milli- pore Corp., Freehold, N.J., USA) and carboxypeptidase B (Boch- ringer Mannheim, FRG) [1 I  Amino acid analyses were carried out with the o phthalalde- hyde precolumn labeling method [4] using a Rainin Cig column. A Spectra Physics 8700 HPLC system and a Schoeffel/Kratos 950 fluorometer were employed with an Alltech 3 Cig column (4.6 x 150 mm). The gradient used was 50 mAfsodium acetate (pH 5.9) to 80% methanol in the same buffer, with 1% tetrahydrofuran in the initial buffer.  Amino acid sequences were determined on approximately $00 pmol of peptide with the Applied Biosystem model 470A gas phase protein sequencer according to the procedure of Hewick et al. {3}. Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified by HPLC (Beck- man 344 HPLC system) using a Bukerbond $ # diphenyt column (4.6 x 250 mm).

All samples were conditioned for 48 hours in the Smoking Lab conditioning room and weight selected by the Smoking Lab prior to analysis.  Four cigarettes from each group were then selected and analyzed using a Borgwaldt smoking machine coupled directly to a Varian 3600 GC. A Cambridge pad on the smoking machine removes the particulate matter from the whole smoke passing only the gas phase to the gas chromatograph. Puffs prior to the sample puff are vented. The sample puff selected is taken on the next puff after the burn line had passed a point 35mm from the tipping paper.  { 1 :  The gas phase column effluent is split into two detectors. The NPD detector is most selective to organic compounds containing nitrogen and the total area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds detected in the gas phase. The other detector is a FID which detects most organic compounds and the total FID  area relates to the total concentration of all these compounds. Experimental conditions are presented in Table I.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  To: Tom Badertscher Date: 28 June, 1994 From: Barbro Goodman Subject: Low Sidestream Cigarette Papers  Enclosed are seventeen bobbins of low sidestream paper for your model development. There are three different grades represented in the two boxes we are shipping to you due to limited availablity of one of the grades. We supplemented the same two Kimberly-Clark grades you have used before (044 and 049) with a new grade that was made in May, 94 with a modified fiber refining process (grade 085). Descriptions of all three grades are listed below. The bobbins that have been perforated by ESP have a -P written inside the core, while the non-perforated bobbins have a -N after the code.  Grade 044 is the commercial paper used on our Superslims cigarettes. There may be another mill trial to reproduce grade 049 towards the end of July, but until then there is no more paper available of that grade. We also have a very limited supply of a paper with a basis weight of 47 g/m’ . If you think you might need an intermediate weight paper for faster burn rate or a lower Coresta paper for additional sidestream reduction, we can ship  more samples at a later date.

draft S . September 30, 1987 - x  MENORANDUM To: The Members of the Executive Committee  From: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr.     This morning, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) proposed in the transportation subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee an amendment to the 1988 Transportation Appropriations bill that would ban smoking on domestic airline flights of two hours or less, for a three-year test period. Because the subcommittee had not had an opportunity to hear arguments on this legislation, it agreed, at the request of Sen. Thad Cochran (R-HS)}, to defer consideration until the full committee meets on the bill tomorrow.  Institute staff and legislative counsel continue their intensive efforts to persuade committee members that such legislation is unnecessary and unjustified.  AS legislation is under consideration -- without benefit of hearings -~ in the Senate, Rep. Norm Mineta (D-CA) next Wednesday (October 7) will keep the pledge he made  in July to hold hearings on legislation to ban smoking on airlines.  The Wednesday hearings, before the Aviation Subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, will include testimony from the Administration, the tobacco and aviation industries, as well as the usual litany of anti-smoking groups.  Philip W. Hazeltine, deputy assistant secretary for policy and international affairs, will testify on behalf of the Department of Transportation. We understand that DoT will offer strong support for the current  regulation, and repeat its earlier recommendations for additional study.  Former Rep. Charles Whitley will testify for The Institute, focusing on public satifaction with the current rules, lack of scientific evidence on which to base claims of adverse health effects from ETS, and the need for additional study. He will be accompanied by scientific expert Larry Holcomb, who will note problems  T11203-0045 __label__Report

Misty Slims Flash Report (12/03/89)  American Tobacco began retail distribution of Misty Slims in Bakersfield, California and Shreveport, Louisiana in August. The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and  at generic prices in Shreveport.  According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989.

Similar to when last reported, the share difference between the two markets appears to be due to the higher levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion versus 20% in Shreveport.  Bakersfield’s incentives include B1G1F’s, $3 off carton purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase. The pantyhose with carton purchase and B1G1F’s continue to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition, only one store offered the free magazine with carton promotion in the generic priced market.  For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has remained relatively constant at 64%. However, distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.

Lead (Pb**) Promotes Apoptosis in Newborn Rat Cerebellar Neurons: Pathological Implications  ALESSANDRA OBERTO, NEVILLE MARKS, HUGH L. EVANS AND ALESSANDRO GUIDOTTI  Center for Neuropharmacology and Neurochemistry (A.O., A.G., N.M.}, N.S, Kline Institute for Psychiatric Hesearch, Orangeburg, New York and Department of Environmental Medicine (H.L.E., A-G.), NYU Medical Center, New York and The Psychiatric institute (A.J.), The University of  iinais at Chicago, Chicago, Ilinois Accepted for publication June 3, 1996     ABSTRACT  Despite mandated reduction in environmental lead (Pb~~), such exposure still poses a public health hazard for children, with devastating effects on CNS development. To replicate aspects of this neurotoxicity, we used cultured granule cells fram newborn rat cerebella to study whether apoptotic or ne- crotic death is the major consequence of exposure to low micromolar concentrations of Pb*~. At a low dose, 1 nM (ECgo = 10 uM), Pb*~ does not affect glutamate-induced neuranal necrosis but promotes neuronal apoptosis, as characterized morphologically by cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation, biochemically by the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmenta- tian and functionally by dependence on new synthesis of mac-  4 %  romolecules (cycloheximide- and actinomycin D-sensitive). The low micromolar doses of Pp** that promote apoptosis are well within the blood level range reported to impair CNS function in children and to alter synaptogenesis in the neonatal rat brain. Thus these in-vitro results suggest that the highly neurotoxic action of Pb" ~ in the developing CNS of children might depend on a facilitation of apoptosis. The Pb* *-elicited potentiation of neuronal apoptasis is attenuated by treatment with the voltage- sensitive Ca** channel agonist Bay K8644, which suggests the possible use of this agonist for treatment of the neurotoxic effects of PhT*.     Subchronic or chronic exposure to Pb** is highly neuro- toxic, affecting particularly the developing CNS (Hammond and Dietrich, 1990). In children, Pb~ ' blood levels as low as 1.3 to 13 uM, may affect CNS development, leading to mental retardation, impaired visual motor coordination and perma- nent cognitive deficits (Goldstein, 1992). Rodents exposed to Pb** just before or after birth exhibit abnormal cytoarchi- tectonic changes in development of the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex, reduction in the number and diameter of axons in the optic nerve and demyelinization of peripheral nerves (Rodier, 1995). Recent data on the interaction of low doses of Pb* * with neonatal brain synaptogenesis have led to the hypothesis that this metal may interfere with the process of synapse trimming by reducing the ratio between active and inactive synapses (Goldstein, 1990). There appear to be in vitro counterparts of the in vive neurotoxicity, because embryonic hippocampal and neonatal rat cerebellar neuronal cultures exposed to low concentrations of Pb** (1-100 »M) fail to differentiate fully or grow (Holtzman et al., 1987; Kern et al., 1993).  A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain why Pb** impairs neuronal function, including inhibition of  aerobic energy metabolism (Haltzman et a/., 1980), substitu- tion of Pb'' for Cat* (Markovac and Goldstein, 1988), inhi- bition of Na*/K*-ATPase activity (Chanez et al., 1988), blockade of VSCCs (Audesirk G., 1993) and blockade of NMDA-selective glutamate receptors (Ujihara and Albuquer- que, 1992). {t has also been suggested that the influence of Pb'* on neuronal growth, survival and differentiation is indirectly mediated via a toxic action on glial cells (Tiffani- Castiglioni e¢ al., 1989).  Several lines of evidence support the notion that neuro- toxic agents may cause neuronal death in the developing brain by two mechanisms: 1) apoptosis (Martin et al., 1988; Oppenheim, 1991; Martin e¢ al., 1992; Franklin and Johnson, 1992; Raff et al., 1993) or 2) necrosis (Choi, 1988; Manev ef al,, 1989, 1990; Koh et ad., 1995). Necrosis is a form of Ca**- dependent neuronal death that may be prompted by an ex- cessive and protracted stimulation of specific glutamate re- ceptors. Apoptosis, on the other hand, is a form of neuronal death that occurs during development and can be triggered experimentally by drugs or toxins that decrease the avail- ability of neurotrop::ie factors. Apoptosis is accompanied by DNA laddering and is blocked in vitro by a number of protein synthesis inhibitors.  Received for publication February 12, 1996.

Role Title of Original Grant: Modulation of nicotine-receptor channels  Abstract of the Specific Aims as stated in the original application:  Aim 1: Modulation of post synaptic nicotine-activated channels subtypes.  Aim 1 of the original application propased to asess the differences amongst native neuronal nAChR subtypes with respect to which subtypes are subject to modulation and which nAChR @ subunits are required for modulation. We proposed to examine the single channel properties and modulation of nAChRs on primary neurons and then compare the behaviour of native nAChRs with those expressed by "subunit deleted" neurons (i.e. neurons treated with subunit-specific antisense oligonucleotides). This analysis was to be complemented by studies of the modulation of nicotine activated channels made up of particular « and B nAChR subunit cDNAs, expressed in Xenopus oocytes.  i : Role of presynaptic nicotine receptors in th: tion of synaptic  Experiments in Aim 2 were to examine the role of presynaptic nicotine receptor channels in the modulation of synaptic function. Our preliminary experiments suggested that nicotine might augment the release of fast excitiatory transmitters. We proposed that different subtypes of nAChRs might mediate nicotine-induced synaptic facilitation, perhaps dependent on the targetting of specific subtypes to terminal fields receiving co-incident cholinergic input. Aim 2 experiments proposed to extend our preliminary findings by examination of both the molecular mechanism(s) and nicotine receptor subtypes responsible for synaptic modulation in the CNS.

IL O88  THe EAS SAETTE  CHONPAIGR. JL  (E)46 GR (S252. 348 aM EERE: <E  a it (Ht     Emerson Fittipaldi, right, showers Michaef Andretti with champagne. Andretti put a stop to a seven-race winning streak by Fittipaldi’s Penske team Sunday.  Andretti puts an end to Penske win streak  By The Associated Preas  Michael Andretti hopes a turnaround for his season came along with a domi- nating victory Sunday in-the Toronto Molson-Indy.  If it did, though, Andretti says the reason is probably off the track, where Chip Ganassl Racing recently signed veteran IndyCar engineer Mo Nunn to help get things sorted out.  Whatever made the difference, though, the 31-year-old Andretti was able to outrace a variety of troubles Sunday to end Team Penske’s seven- race winning streak and earn his fourth Toronto victory.  Andretti, whose best finish since an opening-day victory in Australia was fourth place last month at Milwaukee, took control after bumping and passing Nigel Mansell for the lead on lap 26 as the defending series champion’s right- rear tire deflated.  “I was staying right on Nigel,” Andret- ti explained, “I tried to get past him once and almost wound up in a tire barrier, Then I tapped him a little and just got by him a few turns later. I didn’t know he was having any problem with his tlre. 1 didn’t see that.”  Andretti was virtually unchallenged the rest of the 98-lap, 174.44-mile race, beating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8 seconds in earning his 29th career Indy- Car victory.  “This is a big win for us,” Andretti said. “We started out on a real high with the win in Australia, then every- thing went downhill. It seemed the harder we worked, the slower the car would go.  “We needed a change and we were     Auto racing roundup  fortunate that Mo Nunn left Simon Rac- ing (last month), We went out and got Mo to work with Julian Robertson, my engineer all year long. They make a super team. Hopefully, we're on the way.”  Nunn was the chief engineer for Em- erson Fittipadli in his championship season of 1989,  Miller 500  Geoff Bodine kept insisting that Hoo- Stier tires would withstand the rigors of & long race, and proved it with what amounted to a Sunday drive in the Mill- er Genuine Draft 500 at Long Pond, Pa.  The victory at Pocono International Raceway was the first this year for the Indiana-based race tire manufacturer, Cars running on the Goodyear brand had won the first 16 races on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.  “You're going to see a lot more Hao- sler cars in Victory Lane this year,” Bodine said. “We're proud of what (Hoo- sier president) Bob Newton and his peo- ple have done.”  Bodine, who won the pole in a Ford Thunderbird with a speed of 163.689 mph, led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward Burton by 1.26 seconds for his first vic- tory this season. It was the 14th win of Bodine's career.  Indy Lights Steve Robertson of England extended his point lead in the Firestone Indy Lights racing series with a victory at the Toronto Molson-Indy. te  6P908Zes0z __label__News

Keritsis  Subject: -Desiyned Filler - 1504, Third Quarter, 1975  I. LOW TAR FILLER (LTF) A. Chemical Evaluation  1. The LTF-ILIDF formulation whose whole smoke conden- sate compared favorably to that of LIA has been modified further at the request of the Chemical Research Group (6908). One of  these modifications was that of IIJF which is a similar material to IIDF but without humectant.  The whole smoke condensate of IIJF was then compared to that of IIDF; and based on the correlation of Grimmer fractions II, III and IV with activity, the order of relative predicted activity is LTF-IIJF > LTF-IIDF. The absolute activity, however, is predicted to be low for both types since the yield of fraction II is greater than 90%. in both cases.  2. It was decided to test LTF-IIJF further and the production of 15,000 pounds of this material is scheduled to begin at the BL Pilot Plant on September 22.  B. Smoking Evaluations  Ll. A range of low tar fillers (LTF-IIDF, IIEF, IIJF and IIICF) possessiny similar subjective characteristics, varying tar deliveries, and significantly lower CO values (7-9 myg/cigt) were developed and screened.  2. The blend and flavor development studies were continued with 50 and 75% LTF-1IDF in the blend,  3. The use of a mixture of alkaline earth metal salts of the low molecular weight organic acids (C,-C,») with LTF-IIDF formilation produced an acceptable mainstream/sidestream smoke at tlie 50 and 75% levels.  4. The tole of sheet foaming on tar and CO deliverics is now being investigated with foamed/unfoamed LYF-I1D and I11B.  2000766495  C75-83529 __label__Memo
Fortified Smoke Studies  A. Cigarette Fortificetion Equipment Capacity  1. One Machine:  10 cigarettes/run x 7 runs/day x 7 day/wk = 490 cig. Four Machines:  490 cig/machine/7 day wk x 4 machines = 1960 maxium Anticipated usable cigarettes = 1800/wk  i)  B. Toxicity studies Scheduled for January  In the Toxicity studies mice will be smoked with for- tified smoke for a period of 4 weeks, 10 cig/day, 10 mg/cig. At the end of the 4 week period we proposed to stop smoking and hold the mice for tumor occurrence at the time of mor- bidity. We propose to use the mice now adapted to smoke which have had Sendai infections. After they have been smoked with MCA or BaP or Benzene treated cigarettes, they will be moved from 4807 Laboratory to 4809 Laboratory for observation. This will allow 4807 to be decontaminated and new mice to be brought into the facility.  1. MCA, 10 mg/cig, four - 7 day weeks. 60 mice/(12 mice/machine run) = 5 machine runs/day. 5 machine runs x 10 cig = 50 cig/day. 50 cig/day x 28 days = 1400 cig. . 1400 cig x 10 mg MCA/cig = 14 gm MCA. 1400 cig/(450 cig/one loading machine) = 3.1-wks. 1400 cig/(1800 cig/4 machines) = 0.77 wks.  2. BaP ~- same as MCA 1400 cig, T4 gm BaP, 0.77 wks to load on 4& Machines.  3. Benzene treated cig. 1400 cig, O.77 wks to load on 4 machines or 3.1 wks  on one machine.  C. MCA Series of Fortified Smoke Studies Two Studies are proposed with MCA:  1. We will combine [O01A and B to determine if short term MCA exposure followed by long term Standard Smoke will induce tumors. This would aliow more fortified smoke studies to be undertaken by first exposing to fortified smoke on the Walton and then transfering to the SEM for long term smoking which may act as a promoter. The fol- lowing studies have not included a very important group of controls. We have not included mice which will re- ceive the MCA in smoke and then allowed to live without smoking. The inclusion of these mice required the re- thinking of the entire schedule, equipment capacity, personnel, etc. in most studies. We could include one such group with {001A and B, but not both the 3.25 and 7.0 week exposure period. I! want to suggest that we run one more group for 7 weeks on fortified smoke and no futher smoking.  CTR CONTRACTS 019294 __label__Report

L.A. Approves Strict On-Job Smoking Law  By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer.  Ending nearly a month of public and behind-the- scenes debate, the Los Angeles City Council voted.12 to 3 Tuesday to adopt a strict ordinance: requiring employers throughout: the city to set' aside no-smoking areas for their work- ers.  The final vote, in doubt until the last minute due to heavy. lobbying by. tobacco: industry representa- tives, signaled a. major victory for  nonsmokers’ groups;. who cheered!  and spplauded loudly as ithe result was announced.

Last year, the industry spent:about $2 million in.ass unsuccessful effort to set aside San Francisco's work- place no-smoking ordinance. Braude predicted last week that the tobaceo industry would not rol! ever and accept such a law in the nation's second largest city.

Tobacco industry officials, who also had expressed their views on the subject, were vague after Tues- day's vote about any. future effort: to kill the ordinance.

Unactivated (preincubated at 0°C) (*H} dexamethasone-receptor complex pretreated with N- ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide at 0°C and then treated at 25°C was unable to bind to rat liver nuclei. On the other hand, [*H]dexamethasone-receptor com- plex first incubated at 25°C and then treated with N- etbylmaleimide or iodoacetamide showed marked bind- ing to nuclei, comparable to that obtained with acti- vated cytosol. The results suggest that sulfhydryl mad- ifying reagents act at the level of unactivated glucocor- ticoid-receptor complex, blocking its activation and binding ta nuctei.  It was previously shown that pyridoxal phosphate inhibits the binding of “activated” dexamethasone-re- ceptor complexes to DNA-cellulose in vitro (Cake, M. H., DiSorbo, D, M., and Litwack, G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4886-4891). We have characterized both the N- ethylmaleimide-treated and the pyridoxal phosphate- treated [*Hjdexamethasone-receptor complexes by agarose gel filtration and sucrose-gradient centrifuga- tion; we found that whereas pyridoxal phosphate- treated cytosol at 0°C showed a considerable amount of a smaller fragment of the receptor that was unable to bind to nuclei, N-ethylmaleimide-treated cytosol was totally devoid of this smaller fragment, and resembled untreated, unactivated cytosol. The sulfhydryl modify- ing reagents would appear to tock the receptor into an intact unactivated form as opposed to pyridoxal phos- phate that degrades the molecule into smaller units. Thus, N-ethylmaleimide treatment may be valuable in  the purification of the unactivated form of the receptor to homogeneity.     The formation of the ghucocorticoid-receptor complex in the cytoplasm of the target cells for the hormone, and its activation and translocation to the nuclear acceptor sites, are believed to be of primary importance in the induction of certain enzymes in hepatoma and liver cells (1-3}. We have shown previously that the binding of glucocorticaids to the receptor proteins is markedly inhibited by treatment of the rat liver cytosol with various sulfhydryl modifying reagents (4). Subsequently, Young e¢ a.

It was not clear, however, whether sulfhydryl reagents block the activation of glucocorticoid recepter-complex or its subse- quent binding to nuclear receptor sites. Although some un- derstanding has been achieved concerning the phenomenon of temperature-dependent activation of rat liver glucocorti- coid-receptor complex, the precise mechanism of in vitro activation is not yet known (6-10). The present paper reports evidence suggesting that sulfhydryl reagents block the acti- vation of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex ( per se) and not its subsequent binding to nuclear acceptor sites.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  Methods  Materials—[1,2,4-"H]Dexamethasone (31 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear, with radiochemical purity periodically checked by thin layer chromatography as described previously {11}. Nonradioactive dexamethasone, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, &-mercap- toethanol, and iodvacetamide were purchased from Sigma. N-ethyl- maleimide was obtained from Fluka AG Chemische Fabrik, Switzer- land.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats (from Charles River Breeding Labora- tories}, 150 ta 200 g, were adrenalectomized bilaterally 7 to 9 days before use and were maintained on standard Purina Chow, 0.9% NaCl solution, and water ad libitum.  Preparation of Cytosol—Animals were killed by cervical disloca- tion, and the livers were perfused in situ with ice-cold TS buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.5) and homogenized in a solution (1:2, w/v) of the same buffer, The homogenates were filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 2,000 x g in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor at 2°C for 10 min to sediment a crude nuclear pellet, The cytosol fraction was prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 240,000 x g for 60 min at 0-4°C. The upper fatty layer was discarded and the cytosol was carefully removed and used for steroid binding studies. The cytosol was diluted to yield a protein concentration of approximately 2 mg/ml. The cytosol was then incubated with 5 107 m ("H]- dexamethasone in the presence or absence of a 1000-fold excess of nonradioactive dexamethasone. After incubation for 2 h at 0°C to allow maximal binding, the specific macromolecular-bound fraction of steroid was determined using the charcoal-dextran technique (12).  Treatment of Cytosol with Chemical Reagents—Pyridoxal 5’-phos- phate, iodoacetamide, and N-cthylmaleimide were prepared in con- centrated stock solutions (100 mm, pH 7.5) prior to use in the experiments. Cytosol containing pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, iodoaceta- mide, or N-ethytmaleimide was incubated for 30 min at 0°C in the dark.  Nuclear Binding Assay—Nuclei were purified fram the 2,000 x g pellet using 1.8 »1 sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.025 w KCl and 3 mm MgCl: as previously described (13). The washed nuclei were suspended in homogenization buffer. Aliquots of the nuclear suspension containing 50 yg of DNA were centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 5 min at O°C and the supernatant fractions were discarded. (H]Dexamethasone-treated cytosal (0.2 ml) was added and a final volume of 1 mi of reaction mixture was made by addition of humog- enization buffer. The nuclei were resuspended by gently stirring with @ Vortex mixer, and the suspension was incubated fur 30 min at 0°C. Following incubation, the nuclei were removed by centrifugation at  4687        40033964 __label__Scientific

Mr. Johnston has received a letter, which was forwarded to me, and I subsequently received a phone call from.... a Sally Wilson. Sally is an employee of the New York Metropolitan Authority.  Where she works, they have separately ventilated smoking rooms. They have used them with success for several years now. Recently, however, management said they were still  getting complaints, and they could no longer smoke there at all. Have to step outside.  To be candid, up front, I have to tell you that Sally sounds to me like one of those "what have you done for me in the last five minutes?" types. Rather pushy, fairly humorless, cic.  But, it sounds like they are really, really getting the short cnd of the stick if, as she says, they truly have separately ventilated rooms and can't even use them anymore.  She wants our help. Ultimately, this one looks like it is an organizational/activist challenge. Maybe someone should go to New York and meet with her. See what they can do to help from an activist/organizational standpoint. Who do we have that works N. Y. C. these days? If we were able to help them out, it might be a nice success story for New York.  Frankly, if they already have separately ventilated rooms, and have now been kicked-out of those, there is nothing - nada, zippo - we can do from a technical or ventilation standpoint.  We can and will share our "workplace policy” information with her, Beyond that, if we need to send someone there to satisfy her, I think we should.

4/8/86 CC; DRS. JACOBSON, SOMMERS  GRANT APPLICATION NO. 1959. , REVIEWER: DR. D. H. BOWDEN  APPLICANT: Kenneth B. ADLER, Ph.D. University of Vermont Burlington, VT  TITLE: "Mechanisms of Platelet-Activating Factor Stimulation of Respiratory Mucin Secretion"     BROAD GOALS OF THE PROJECT:  Dr. Adler who works in the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont has used a rodent tracheal explant system for a number of years. He is interested in mediators of the asthmatic response and the mediators of mucin secretion.  HYPOTHESIS:  Platelet-activating-factor (PAF) increases the secretion of mucin by binding to specific cell surface receptors activating hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides and therefore stimulating metabolism of arachidonic acid within respiratory secretory cells.  1. He wishes to characterize the stimulation of mucin secretion induced by exposure to PAF.  2. To determine whether or not specific cell surface receptors for PAF are involved.  3. To determine the contribution of arachidonic acid and its metabolites to PAF-induced mucin secretion.  4, To determine whether or not metabolism of phosphoinositides is involved in the secretory response to PAF.  EXPERIMENTAL METHODS:  In conjunction with colleagues at the W. Alton Jones Cell Laboratory he has developed an in vitro system in which dissociated cells from guinea pig:trachea are found to differentiate into a pseudostratified columnar epithelium virtually identical to that in intact tissue with ciliated, goblet and basal cells maintained in the same orientation. This is the model he proposes to'use for his PAF studies.  1. The first experiments will determine the concentration-response relationship between PAF and mucin secretion in the cell culture system.  2. Specific receptor antagonists of PAI will be added to cell cultures at equimolar concentrations and the effects on mucin secretion monitored.  3. Media will be assayed for specific metabolites of arachidonic acid after exposure to stimulatory concentrations of PAF. Expected products     50258031 __label__Report

There will be one generic badge for entering and exiting the room and my badge will also be recognized by the reader. Security has my name and numbers as the contact. There is one potential problem with August 20 - 23 (Norma Machich wants the room for "kids day”) - she and I have already spoken on this issue and I have it on my tickler to follow up with her at the end of July as to whether or not she will need to move the "kids day activities” to another conference room.  We have a retiree (Ed Stultz) who is interested in covering the production and he is available for weekends and after hours. Jim McNasby and I are coordinating on having Ed Stultz brought in through the arrangement we have with HGW. (If there are any glitches in Ed's availability, I plan to fill in on  coverage.)

One pellet is inserted into the tip end of a plastic filter holder resembling a hollow cigarette rod and is puffed upon.  The product was assembled and "puffed" for forty consecutive 35 ml puffs to determine the presence of any released components in the vapor state. Nicotine, PG, glycerin and menthol vapors released through puffing on a 5-port smoking machine were trapped and analyzed following a previously established procedure? The components released by dry puffing were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results generated from the menthol version are compared to results from the non-menthol version reported previously are shown below:  Menthol = = —s_ Non-Menthol  Nicotine ND Glycerin ND PG ND Menthol <0.2 mg  5866  The pellets were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Analysis for glycerin, PG, menthol, and TA showed no within and between carton differences. Comparisons of these components to Twenty-Two (Regular) showed greatest difference in menthol levels.

C., November 19, 1969, Industry scientists replied to Dr. Perry Hudson's criticisms of the Chemosol protocols,  At the end of the day, the American Chemosol Corporation representatives, Mr. Roche and Mr. Beck, agreed to proceed with the program as detailed in the two protocols. It is presumed that Mr. Austern obtained the agreement in  writing. Mr. Austern requested me to notify the Industry scientific representatives of the agreement,  Possibly the greatest area of disagreement between American Chemosol Corporation and the Industry related to benzo(a)pyrene analyses Mr. Gargus stated that such analyses would be performed routinely on Control and Chemosol-treated cigarette condensates, Mr. Beck pressed strongly for taking such data available immediately to the American Chewosol Corpuration. Mr. Austern made it clear that such data would not be released before Hazleton's final report was issued.  This is a good opportunity for me to express my appreciation for the excellent cooperation, hard work, and scientific competence of Dr. Burke and Mr. Carpenter, my subcommittee colleagues. It's a shame that so much quality  work has had to be expended on something like Chemosol.  I am also grateful to the Research Directors for their cooperation and understanding.

-- Talking Points --  Research Arm of Congress Releases Study Critical of Proposal To Raise Cigarette Taxes  The Congressional Research Service, the independent research arm of Congress,  has issue a report casting doubt on the wisdom of raising the federal cigarette tax  to pay for President Clinton's plan for government-run health care.  1. Smokers Already Pay Their Fair Share in Social Costs -- Increased health —  costs, sick leave and other expenses smoking imposes on society do not justify the Clinton Administration's proposed 75 cents per pack cigarette excise tax hike, CRS says.  — CRS found that existing state and federal cigarette excise taxes, which average about 50 cents a pack, already cover average estimates of smoking's so-called “costs imposed by smokers on non-smokers."  — One estimate suggests smoking does not impose any extra costs on non- smokers. Rather, it provides net savings to the non-smoking population due to reduced drain on social security and pension payouts.  — The report cited a 1991 study by Willard G. Manning that found the net external cost per pack of cigarettes was about 16 cents for smokers. It also looked at a 1989 RAND.Corporation study, which found that, in 1986, each smokers ends up costing society about 15 cents per pack of cigarettes -- which translates into 21 cents today because of inflation -- but still below the current 24-cents a pack federal tax, and considerably lower than the overall average of 50 cents a pack for all federal and state taxes.  — CRS also found the Manning Study made a “much stronger case" for taxing alcoholic beverages at a higher rate. “An alcohol tax would appear to be more efficient and more equitable: the best estimate of alcohol's net external cost exceeds current tax levels; alcohol taxes are also regressive, but less so than cigarette taxes," the CRS study found.  97OL 9BSTS __label__Report
DEVELOIHENTAL BIOLOGY 129, 169-178 (1988)  Molecular Consequences of awa®*, A Cell-Autonomous Lethal Mutation  of Drosophila Induced by Hybrid Dysgenesis  CHARLES R. DEAROLF,! NICK TRIPOULAS, JOE BIGGS, AND ALLEN SHEARN Department of Biology, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218  Accepted May 2, 1988  The abnormal wing disc locus, which is at salivary gland chromosome position 100C-D of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, has been identified by a recessive lethal mutation, awd™, induced by hybrid dysgenesis. When homozygous, this mutation eauses abnormal development of the brain, the ovaries, and the larger imaginal discs as described in the preceding paper (C. R. Dearolf, E. Hersperger, and A. Shearn, 1988, Dev. Biol. 129, 159-168). The DNA corre- sponding to this locus was isolated from a genomic library prepared from awd” heterozygotes by screening with a P-element probe. The awd” aliele resulted from the insertion of a P-element fragment into a gene that encodes an 0.8-kb poly(A)* RNA. In mutant larvae, that 0.8-kb transcript is replaced by two chimeric transcripts that are 0.7 and 1.3kbin length, both of which contain P-element and awd sequences. The wild-type azwd* gene transcript is most abundant during the second and third larval instars but is found at a lower level during every developmental stage as well as in continuous cell lines. Thus the azwd* gene transcript can be detected in normal larvae at a developmental stage long before defects are expressed in mutant larvae. Moreover, some tissues, for example the salivary gland of nonmutant, third-instar larvae, contain high levels of this transcript, even though these tissues appear to develop normally in  mutant larvae. ©1988 Academic Press, Inc.  INTRODUCTION  The abnormal wing discs (awd) gene of Drosophila was identified in a screen for hybrid-dysgenic late larval/ early pupal lethal mutations (Dearolf et al, 1988). The most obvious defect caused by mutations at this locus is the abnormal morphology of wing dises dissected from homozygous mutant, third-instar larvae. Such dises are smaller than normal discs of a comparable age, they are misshapen, and they are incapabie of differentiating a normal inventory of wing structures. Further studies revealed that the eye-antenna and leg discs are also affected by the mutation. Although those discs appear morphologically normal, they are also incapable of dif- ferentiating a normal inventory of imaginal structures. In addition to these imaginal disc defects, which were shown to be cell autonomous, it was observed that transplanted mutant ovaries were sterile and that the mutant central nervous system was histologically ab- normal (Dearolf, 1986; Dearolf et ai, 1988).  The developmental consequences caused by the awd’® lethal mutation provided some inferences about the normal requirements for the product of the gene (Dearolf et ai, 1988). It was inferred that during em- bryogenesis and early larval development the awd* gene is not required, that during the second half of normal larval development the awd* gene is required in  * Present address: Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineer- ing, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125.  169     50603971  the wing disc as well as in the brain, and that somewhat later in development it is required in the eye-antenna and leg dises and the ovary.  However, the normal pattern of gene transcription cannot necessarily be determined from the analysis of the developmental consequences of mutations (McKeown ef al., 1987; Hartley et al, 1987). In order to determine the pattern of gene transcription for awd, we have isolated both genomic DNAs and cDNAs which correspond to the awd gene, analyzed the pattern of accumulation of the awd* transcript during normal de- velopment, and analyzed the effect of the awd muta- tion on that pattern. These results considerably extend what was inferred about the expression of the awd gene from studying the developmental consequences of mu- tations in the gene and have provided the foundation for identifying the awd protein.

I have followed your advice and have outlined the research projects being in- vestigated in my laboratory. I trust this information will be considered by the Scientific Advisory Board, and I look forward to their decision.  Research Problem  I. Background - We are investigating the biological and biochemical aspects of herpesvirus oncogenesis by employing three related equine herpesviruses (EHV) which have proven to be ideal model systems as the three viruses share DNA sequences but differ markedly in biological activities (see review provided, O'Callaghan et al., 1978). In the last year we have shown that UV-irradiated virus or standard virus preparations enriched for defective interfering (DI) particles will transform primary hamster (inbred LSH) embryo cells, and several cell lines transformed by each of these herpesviruses have been established. We have demonstrated that the EHV-1 and EHV~2 (cytomegalovirus) cell lines are oncogenically transformed and have established numerous tumor cell lines from the  tumor tissues (malignant fibrous sarcomas that metastasize to lung, heart, bone, and CNS); the EHV-3 transformed cells have been inoculated into hamsters within the last two weeks.  In the case of the EHV-1 system, DNA hybridization analyses have shown that cells of transformed cell lines, tumor tissues, and tumor cell lines harbor viral DNA sequences (3-20% of the genome; 0.3-4.0 copies/ceil).  Some of these viral genes are retained even after prolonged (+100 passages) passage in either cell culture or in the animal (transplantable tumors),  and the expression of these viral DNA sequences has been shown by 1) demon- stration of antibody to EHV-1 proteins in the sera of tumor bearing hamsters and 2) detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins in the cell membranes and perinuclear space by immunofluorescence.

I'd like to share my own  views, since I've had some experience with the issue.  A small but vocal group of employees have pressured me to either ban smoking or to segregate smokers and nonsmokers. When they first approached me I considered the situation but,  for several reasons, decided against any restrictions.  First, implementing smoking policies would have required ; that I take action against good employees who have worked  for me for quite some time. Second, to implement a smoking policy would have disrupted my company's work process, since, as in many offices, employees with similar skills and responsi-  bilities work together.  Furthermore, once I took a hard look at the situation, I dis- covered that the vast majority of my employees were neither  aware of nor particularly interested in the problem.  I have not read any of Weis' articles to which Solmon referred nor have I considered the economic aspect of the argument on which Solmon's article was based. But common sense suggcsts that rearranging people, changing policies, implementing re-  strictions, and disrupting my workforce won't save me moncy.  Sincerely,  TIOK 0027645 __label__Letter

Miller  The attached is the final report for the Cambridge Advertising Development Mini-Groups that were conducted in Phoenix, Arizona on January 11th, 12th and 13th. Fifteen mini- groups were conducted among men and women, ages 25-49 who regularly smoke: Cambridge/C-Store Private Labels/Distributor Brands or National Deep Discount Brands. The objectives of this research were to examine opportunities for Cambridge advertising that would attract interest from the C-Store/Wholesale Competitive Discount Brands' smokers and also would provide reinforcement to current Cambridge smokers.  It is important to note that research was conducted on the advertising prior to Phoenix: 33 in-depth interviews were conducted on December 14th and 15th in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota among men and women, ages 25-54 who regularly smoke: Cambridge/Private Label/Deep Discount. The objectives of this research were to determine the relevance of two proposed campaigns ("Side by Side Comparison" & "Testimonial") to Cambridge and B&W/PL smokers, and determine any negatives associated with either of the campaigns or their specific executions.  Key Findings  The findings of both rounds of research were consistent. The overall finding being that the comparison of Cambridge to Store Brands does not appear to be a relevant nor compelling message to these smokers.  moker      For the most part, these smokers appear to be content with what they are smoking. Asa result, the ads and concepts shown didn't provide a motive to switch. The Cambridge name did not provide an added advantage, warranting a higher price.  The term "Store Brand" does not appear to be relevant to consumers. The propositions/benefits conveyed in the concept statements/advertising were determined to be insignificant/not pertinent to these smokers.  For those not negatively predisposed to Cambridge's taste, some of the claims about Cambridge would convert them to a purchase only if it was comparably priced to their current low-priced brand.  Cambridge Smokers  Cambridge smokers do not appreciate the frame of reference to low-priced brands, they see their brand as being comparable to FM brands in terms of quality but they just pay less for theirs.

Blynn Vice President and Deputy General Counsel A ChE R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Post Office Box 2959 Oe _ -0O Winston-Salem, NC 27102 0 ? RE: Use of Brand Names on Matchbooks L.  Dear Mr. Blynn:  T now chair the NAAG Tobacco Enforcement Committee. The Committee has your letter dated May 10, 2000, which responds to our letter of April 13, 2000, wherein we expressed our view that Brand Name advertising on matchbooks violates section III(f) of the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). We also have a June 16, 2000 letter from Paul G. Gaston,  attorney for D.D. Bean & Sons, Co, We have considered both letters and remain unpersuaded by your position.  The distinctions cited in your letter are irrelevant to whether matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of the MSA, As we previously explained, matchbooks are “merchandise” within the meaning of section Ti1(f) of the MSA because they may be bought and sold as commercial products and have uses other than advertising. Matchbooks do not fit within any of the exceptions specified in section ll(f). Matchbooks are not Tobacco Products, their sole function is not advertising of Tobacce Products, and they are net written or electronic publications. Consequently, they fall squarely within the ban on Tobacco Brand Name Merchandise imposed by section III(f).  Moreover, as we stated in our letter of April 13th, it is of no consequence that matchbooks may be owned, made, and distributed by third parties because, under section HIG) of the MSA, a Participating Manufacturer may not authorize a third party to “use. . .any Brand Name in a manner prohibited by [the MSA] if done by the Participating Manufacturer itself.”  Ol9S r6Pes __label__Letter

The major part of this oonsumption (about 3,000 tonnes) was located in the USA. The process, called "Liquid Freon Freezant )”, was used  primarily to freeze seafood and cern-on-the-cob (with a CFC consumption of aboyt1,500 .  tonnes for each product) and raspberries. Most of the equipment was installed before 1974 but has a long expected life. nn , a, oe Sa  This CFC consumption can be totally eliminated using currenily available alternative freezing  methods - primarily the cryogenic techniques (LIN), which use'liquid nitrogen, and air blast  : freezing.

SUMMARY : -  The possibility was recognized that syrups of enzyme-hydrolyzed hydroxypropylated starch might be of commercial value. However, prior to obtaining FDA approval for the sale of such material, a survey of the low molecular weight fragments to DP4 would have been desired. Penick & Ford requested an estimate of the effort that might be required to obtain and develop the methods and information. Preliminary analyses of typical syrups from Penick & Ford were made using .gas chromatography (1) and thin-layer chromatography (2). The results of this investigation, along with recommendations for possible paths of approach, were furnished Penick & Ford. Since then, the decision has been reached by them to  terminate this program.  MEMORANDUM:  Three samples of enzyme degraded hydroxypropyl] starch syrups were prepared by Mr. R. B. Nelson of Penick & Ford from propylene oxide-substituted corn starch (3). These ranged in D.E. from 14.6 to 16.7%. The base starches used in the production of these syrups ranged from 1.30 to 4.42% propylene oxide substitution based on dry substance. The syrups were carbon treated, ion-exchanged and concentrated to about 80% total solids prior to being  received by us. __label__Scientific

Box 223  13 Lincoln Road  Great Neck, NY 11022  Dear Len:  Thank you so much for enclosing that exceedingly interesting paper by Martensson, Larsson and Zettergren dealing with malignant mesothelioma in siblings. It is of interest that cases one and two are both epithelial types of malignant mesothelioma. Finally, and most extraordinary, in cases three and four, both were biphasic types and had the dominating fibrous component. The latter were identical twins. This, of course, fosters our hypothesis of high genetic specificity relevant to the histologic form of mesothelioma. This is very timely indeed in that we have a paper (enclosed) in press in Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics. This project of mine was supported by CTR. T will let you know when it is published which should be very shortly since I returned the galleys.  Things are moving slowyy, but hopefully, steadily with respect to HCI.

Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA . Vol. 91, pp. 772-776, January 1994 . Medical Sciences  An integral membrane protein (LMP2) blocks reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus from latency following surface  immunoglobulin crosslinking  Cyerye L. MILER, JENNIFER H. Lee, ELLiott Kierr*, AND RICHARD LONGNECKERT  Departments of Medicine and Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 75 Francis S$:reet, Boston, MA 02115  Communicated by Peter M. Howley, October 8, 1993 (received for review August 30, 1993)  ABSTRACT The role of latent membrane protein 2 (LMP?) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBY) infection was evaluated by using latently infected primary B lymphocytes that had been growth transformed by wild-type or specifically mutated EBV recombinants. LMP2 null mutant recombinant EBV-infected cells were similar to normal B lymphocytes in their rapid increase in intracellular free calcium after surface immuno- globulin crosslinking. These cells also became more permissive for lytic EBV replication. In sharp contrast, wild-type control infected cells had little or no increase in intracellular free calcium or in permissivity for EBV replication. The bleck to surface immunoglobulin crosslinking-induced permissivity in cells expressing wild-type LMP2 could be bypassed by raising intracellular free catcium levels with an ionophore and by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13- acetate. LMP2A, not LMP2B, mediates this effect on calcium mobilization. Genetic and biochemical data are consistent with these effects being due to the interaction of the LMP2A N-terminal cytoplasmic domain with B lymphocyte sre family tyrosine kinases.     Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that establishes latency in B lymphocytes during primary infection. Latent infection of B lymphocytes is likely to be essential for perpetuation of this virus in human populations, since virus reactivation from latency is the major reservoir of virus for infection of susceptible hosts. In latent infection, the virus can express six nuclear proteins [EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs)], two integral membrane proteins [latent mem- brane proteins (LMPs)}, and two small RNAs, thereby caus- ing proliferation of the infected lymphocyte (1-3). Latently infected lymphocytes can cause a lymphoproliferative dis- ease in immunodeficient individuals (4-6). The EBNAs and LMPs are being intensively studied since they are likely to be involved in the maintenance or regulation of latency or of the concomitant effects on cell proliferation. This report focuses on LMP2, the protein(s) most recently discovered to be expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes (7-9).  Two forms of LMP2 (designated LMP2A and -2B) are expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes. Both forms are encoded by highly related mRNAs composed of eight exons with a single long open reading frame, differing only in their first exons (10-12). The first exon of LMP2A encodes a 119-amino acid hydrophilic N terminus that is unique to LMP2A. The promoter for LMP2B is in the first LMP2A intron, and the first LMP2B exon is noncoding. The first codon of the second exon in LMP2A and -2B is a methionine codon, at which translation of LMP2B initiates. That methi- onine is followed by 12 predicted hydrophobic transmem- brane domains separated by short reverse turns and a 27-  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

LMP2A and -2B posttranslationally insert into membranes (12).  Although initial biochemical evidence pointed to an im- portant role for LMP2 in cell growth transformation, EBV recombinants with mutations affecting any part of LMP2 are fully competent for inducing B-lymphocyte transformation and the transformed cells are indistinguishable from wild type (WT) in growth in vizro or in severe combined immunodefi- ciency (scid) mice (13), (C.L.M., R.L., and E.K., unpub- lished data). Nevertheless, LMP2A does associate with LMP1 in latently infected cell plasma membranes (14), and LMP1 is a key effector of EBV-induced cell growth trans- formation (15-20). Furthermore, LMP2A patches in the plasma membrane are major sites of tyrosine phosphoryla- tion, and LMP?2A is associated with, and tyrosine phosphor- ylated by, B-lymphocyte sre family tyrosine kinases (14, 21).  The experiments described in this report were designed to test the hypothesis that a key role of LMP? in interacting with src-related tyrosine kinases is to block transmembrane signal transduction in latently EBV-infected lymphocytes and thereby prevent fortuitous activation of lytic infection. Three previous lines of evidence are consistent with this hypothe- sis. First, crosslinking of surface immunoglobulin (slg) can activate a switch to lytic replication in a few latently EBV- infected cell lines (22, 23). The cell line in which crosslinking of sIg can most efficiently induce such effects is a Burkitt lymphoma cell tine in which LMP2 is not expressed (24). Second, expression of LMP2A in Burkitt tumor lymphoblasts at the level normally seen in latently infected ceils blocks the calcium mobilization response to crosslinking of slg, CD19, or major histocompatibility complex class II (25). Finally, LMP2aA interacts with src family tyrosine kinases, which are key effectors of sig-mediated B-lymphocyte activation (26). We now present evidence that LMP2A blocks the effects of slg crosslinking on calcium mobilization and reactivation of EBV from latent infection in growth-transformed normal human B lymphocytes.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell Lines and Cell Culture. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established by infecting normal human B tym- phocytes with either WT or LMP2 mutant recombinant EBV (13, 27, 28). LCLs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (2 u2/ml). Akata is a membrane IgG-positive Burkitt lymphorna cell line.

Pasheluk E: Tobacco Advertising  The attached article which appeared in the "New York Times" on Thursday, June 30 is cause for concern on many different. levels..  One of the more serious aspects of the legislation. is that affecting the (banned) use of cigarette brand! names in the type of promotional activities normally used to build and reinforce brand imagery i.e. Newport Ski Spree, associations with local sporting events such as a recent Kent putting contest in Phoenix, etc.  The legislation does, however, permit use of a corporate name; a decided: edge for the more well known Philip: Morris and RJR.  Now is the time for Lorillard to build greater awareness. of. the corporate name so that. should it become necessary (i.e. similar legislation as that passed in Canada being enacted here) we could stay competitve in promotional. events.  Several vehicles for such a program could be considered: An advertising "Quality" campaign not unlike Ford Motor. Company's "Quality is: Job 1" campaign; simply greater association. of the Lorillard name with branded products. via a logo or slogan i.e. recall Nabisco's famous red triangle logo appearing at the end of all broadcast ads for any of their products or, perhaps, the investigation of the Lorillard name itself on a new brand. such as a potential. breakthrough product. (as in our Reduced. Side Stream project) or, a branded generic product.  If any of this sounds reasonable to you we: could begin by evaluating awareness and imagery of the Lorillard name and then formulate objectives and strategies to build on and exploit that equity.  Can we discuss further, at your convenience?     /kw Attachment  cc: T.H. Mau  SZETSOLS __label__Memo

Keritsis  PM CASE 641 DIVISION III  Craig in U.S. Patent 2,583,548 teaches the treatment of cellulosic pulp containing 1% to 6% of fibers with an excessive amount (10%) of a calcium chloride solution which gives a salt to fiber dry weight ratio from 1.6/7 to 10; causing the pulp containing the calcium chloride to a prolonged mechanical treatment, and then adding a soluble salt such as sodium carbonate to react with the calcium chloride to form a precipitated calcium compound pigment.  Our case (Serial No. 519,619) differs from that of Craig in that the  cellulosic pulp is caused to swell and hydrate by chemical means by react-  ing the cellulosic pulp with the ammonium and/or alkali metal hydroxides which in addition force the polyvalent metal ions to be fixed in the  cellulosic matrix either as a water insoluble precipitate or as a "salt" of the cellulosic matrix. Both of these mechanisms of precipitating or fixing metalic ions uniformly in the cellulosic matrix are probably  responsible for altering the combustion of the cellulosic substrate and  for improving the subjective character of smoke. The required amounts  of precipitated or fixed metal ions needed to achieve this effect is significantly lower than that practiced by Craig for a different purpose (in our case the ratio of salt to cellulosic material is less than 0.4).  Briskin, et. al., (U.S. Patent 3,640,285) deals with the treatment of cigarette paper containing calcium or magnesium or strontium or barium oxalate, pivalate, tannate. This paper could be produced by treating an existing cigarette paper containing calcium carbonate with oxalic acid or pivalis or tannic, or by adding the desired salt to the cellulosic pulp used in the original formation of the paper web (see column 2 lines 65-69).  In this case, Briskin teaches the selection of one salt over another for  a cigarette paper and his method of treatment in no way teaches or makes obvious the treatment of cellulosic material with hydroxides of ammonium and/or alkalies to uniformly fix a polyvalent metal cation to the celluto- sic matrix. In column 2 lines 37-38 “The oxalic acid solution operates to convert calcium carbonate to insoluble calcium oxalate." We do not see any  relation in this statement to those of ours since Briskin converts one insoluble salt, CaC03, to another insoluble salt, calcium oxalate, and  according to his earlier statement, column 2 lines 65-69 it does not make a difference whether the oxalate is added to the paper at the pulping section in place of calcium carbonate or is formed by treating the paper containing  the carbonate with oxalic acid. As a result our invention is in'no way  similar or obvious from the Briskin teachings. Also, it is claimed in Claim  1 that one of the anions that could be used to form the calcium salt is "“Yactic acid" which forms calcium lactate with a very good solubility in water! ,     £SSU8SS8202 __label__Memo

Nearly two years ago in this paper I reported on the advertizing blitzes and media campaigns of American cigaretle companies here (“Welcome to Marlboro Country: the new Transylvania”, Jan. 25, 1996.)

I suppose I naively hoped some congressional action would result, cutting back government support for the tobacco industry overseas. After all, wasn't President Clinton encouraging initiatives to decrease smoking, especially among youth?  Whatever Congress or the White House may or may not have done, our tobacco companies’ efforts in Eastern Europe and Romania have reached phenomenal proportions, and more and more people -- especially the young --  are smoking more than ever before.  We have here a public health epidemic. There is virtually no education about the dangers of smoking: Even the doctors smoke.

ISSUE BRIEF INDOOR AIR QUALITY (IAQ)  ISSUE  Since the energy crisis in the 1970’s, there has been a trend toward constructing buildings with totally controlled indoor environments. These "tight" buildings, designed to reduce energy costs, often expose occupants to poor indoor air quality, resulting in what is known as “sick building syndrome.” Occupants’ complaints of eye irritation, headaches, fatigue, sore throats and nausea may suggest problems in the design, operation, or maintenance of a building’s ventilation or air handling system. Tobacco smoke, because it is the only visible pollutant, has often been targeted as the major or sole source of the problem.  While tobacco smoke is often blamed as the cause of indoor air quality problems, in almost all cases, it is a symptom, not a cause. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and private investigators have concluded that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a cause of discomfort by building occupants in only 2 to 4 percent of cases investigated. And even those cases, experts say, can be solved with improved ventilation.  Serious health threats may exist from pollution sources such as office machine and furnishing contaminants, chemicals from photocopiers, and sulfur dioxide from buildings’ heating systems. Furthermore, the lack of maintenance of ventilation systems allows microbes, insects, fungi and bacteria to accumulate within the systems and circulate throughout the building.  BACKGROUND  Indoor air quality legislation has three components. Simplified, they are ventilation standards, indoor air quality studies and indoor air quality standards. The first indoor air quality legislation to be considered required buildings to provide proper ventilation, often by meeting generally accepted industry standards for ventilation as set by the American Society of Health, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). In November of 1989, ASHRAE revised its standard, increasing its ventilation standard for office buildings -- a three-to-four fold increase in fresh air requirements from the 1981 standard of 5 cubic feet per minute (cfm) per person. The old standard set two separate ventilation rates, one for smoking areas (20 cfm) and one for nonsmoking areas (5 cfm); the revised standard has one ventilation rate for both smoking and nonsmoking  areas (a minimum of 15 cfm).  Today, legislation has moved beyond merely removing the only visible indoor pollutant. Many legislatures are interested in the wide range of serious indoor pollutants and several have established Task Forces to study the sources of pollution as well as promulgating rules to improve indoor environments.  11291-1987 __label__Report

COCONINO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH     GEORGE J. GRAHAM Owector  Youth Access to Cigarettes in Flagstaff, AZ  SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION  A recent round of unannounced compliance buys at 83 Flagstaff tobacco retailers and vending machines has shown that minors could @asily buy cigarettes. Compliance buy surveys completed nationwice have documented that about 50-100% of the attempts were successful.  In Flagstaff, fifteen to sixteen year old youths bought cigarettes 61.4% of the time. The percentage jumps to 92% from. vending machines. Over half of the vending machines were in clear sight of employees, nonetheless, minors still bought cigarettes.  Warning signs stating the 18 year old age limit to purchase tobacco products were posted at only 25.9% of locations. Identification was asked of the minors only 33.7% of the time. On two occasions, even after presenting the clerk with underage identification, the clerk still sold the cigarettes to the minor.  Businesses most likely to sell to a minor were, gas/convenience (46.8%), restaurant/bar (100%), and Other which included hotels/motels, and bowling alleys (88.8%). Almost ail in the restaurant/bvar and Other catagory were vending machines.  METHOD  In February, 1994, unannounced inspections (compliance buys) were conducted at almost all Flagstaff tobacco retailers and vending machines. This included 56 lecations where cigarettes can be bought over-the-counter, and 27 vending machines. Although the sample used was not random, nearly all of the tobacco retailers were covered.  Minors ages 15-16 attempted to buy cigarettes at a total of &83 locations. Two minors, or a minor and adult escort (who would walk in after minor to avoid association) entered the tobacco retail outlet or vending machine location. The minor located the Cigarettes, picked a name brand (Marlboro, Camel), brought them to the cashier and attempted purchase. For vending machines they would put the money in and buy the cigarettes. If.the minor was asked their age or for I.D., they were instructed not to lie, and to show their I.D.  After the purchase attempt, the minor filled out a questionnaire that collected objective information based upon their observations  oz the location, situation and experience.

Up-regulation of Brain PGE, and PGF,, Receptor-coupled Second Messengers  Inhibition in Newborn Pigs?  DING-YOU LI,? DAYA R. VARMA? and SYLVAIN CHEMTOB? , Research Center of Heépital Sainte-Justine (S.C), Department of Pharmacology and  Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacalogy, Therapeutics, McGill University (D.Y.L, D.FLV.), Montreal, Canada  Accepted for publication September 1, 1994  Receptors and by Cyclooxygenase  eee  ABSTRACT  We recently reported that brain synaptosomes of newborn pigs contained fewer PGE, (EP) and PGF, (FP) receptors than adut tissues. In the present study we investigated whether this was the result of down-regulation of these receptors by high levels of PGE, and. PGF,,, in the brain of newbom animals. Newbom pigs (1-3 days oid) were treated with ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) or indomethacin (5 mg/kg) iv. every 4 hr for 24 hr to reduce prostaglandins to adutt levels. At the end of the treatment, EP and FP receptor density and receptor-linked second messen- ger formation in brain synaptesomes were measured. it was found that ibuprofen and indomethacin treatment increased EP and FP receptor densities in brain Synaptosomes of newbom animals to levels found in the adult: this up-regulation of EP receptors was prevented by EP receptor agonist, 16,16-di-  methyi-PGE., and the up-regulation of FP receptors was pre- vented by the FP agonist, fenprostalene. PGE,, butaprost fan agonist for EP, receptor subtype mediating cAMP Stimulation) and 11-deoxy-PGE, (an agonist for EP. and EP, receptors) caused a comparable increase of cAMP in brain syMaptesomes of ibuprofen-treated and adutt animals, which was signifi  greater than in those of vehicle-treated animais. Also, PGF, and its analog, fenprostalene, caused a Much greater increase in IP, production in brain Synaptosomes of ibuprofer-treated than in vehicle-treated pigs. These findings suggest that the relatively low EP and FP receptor densities in newborn pigs are Caused by the high levels of prostaglandins and that these  receptors can be up-regulated by inhibiting prostaglandin syn- thesis.  eee  PGE; and PGF,, are major prostaglandins in the brain (Gaudet et al., 1980; White and Hagen, 1982; Chemtob et ai, 1990b) which may affect cerebral metabolism (Chemtob et al,, 1990b; Pickard ef al., 1977), PGE, and PGF, exert their effects via specific receptors defined, respectively, as EP re- ceptors and FP receptors (Kennedy et al., 1982; Coleman, 1987). EP receptors are further classified into EP,, EP, and EP, subtypes (Coleman e¢ al., 1987; Halushka et al,, 1989; Eglen and Whiting, 1989), Activation of FP and EP, recep- tors increases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production (Suba and Roth, 1987; Halushka e¢ al., 1989; Watabe et ai, 1993). Stimulation of EP, receptors causes an increase and stimulation of EP, receptors mostly leads to a decrease in adenosine 3°,5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) formation (Jumblatt and Paterson, 1993; Sugimoto et ai., 1992: Honda —  Received for publication June 16, 1994. * Supported by grants from the Medical Research Council of Canada, Amer- ican Heart Association, United Cerebral Palsy Foundation and Biopedia. ?

However, the mecha- nisms underlying these age-dependent differences in brain EP and FP receptors are not known,  Various receptors, especially beta adrenoceptor, are down- regulated by agonists (Lefkowitz et al, 1990; Vincent et al, 1992). Down-regulation of EP receptors (Robertson et al.,  - 1980; Limas and Limas, 1987: Hashimoto et af, 1991; Vin-  cent ef al, 1992), FP receptors (Lamsa ez al, 1992) and thromboxane A, receptors (Okwu et al., 1992) by prostanoids as well as up-regulation of EP receptors by inhibiting pros- taglandin synthesis (Rice et al., 1981) has been reported on adult tissues. Because the plasma and brain concentrations of prostagiandins, Specifically of PGE, and PGF,,, are much higher in the perinatal Period than in adult life (Mitchell ez al., 1978; Jones et al., 1993), we hypothesized rhat the higher levels of PGE, and PGF,, in the newborn tight down-regu- late brain EP and FP receptors and their signal transduction systems.

fre  cha hymob  tnarl 2 r Ud hh,  PROMOTED VOLUME FLOW IN/OUT ISSUES  The issue of flow in/flow out has created a long term measurement issue with regards to retail promoted volume.  Simplistically, this issue is driven by the inability to more accurately evaluate Regions’/Divisions' PV based on retail or wholesale volume. Compounding this issue is: the dynamic nature of volume as it is affected by the key measurement of time; and the geographic location of direct accounts versus  that of their customers.  ideally, available volume measurement systems should be demographically specific, dynamic with regard to variance, and inclusive of the total universe. Any shortfall in these characteristics reduces evaluation to a poll versus accurate  and/or predictable data.  Current volume measurements issues are as follows:  e SIS - demographically specific, inclusive of the universe, but not very dynamic. _e AIM - demographically specific, relatively dynamic, but not totally inclusive of the universe. e MSA - dynamic, but not inclusive, and often not demographically specific.  Current PV measurements are directly affected by the above issues, and rendered inconsistent by them on a Region by Region basis. Further complicating this problem is the selected methodologies available.  Specific issues: -  EvcS Bbbes __label__Report

September 15, 1983 Grant Application No. 1630; Henry Sershen, New York.  Dr. Sershen is a relatively young investigator who did most of his training  and work at New York University.  This is an application similar to the one we had already in the same bdook which deals with the mechanism of Parkinson's disease. The previous application mentioned the fact that smokers seem to have a lesser incidence of Parkinson's disease. No mention is made of this in the present application. However, he introduces a new approach, namely that of using a new compound which can give rise to severe Parkinson's disease in humans. This compound MPTP seems to be quite effective in this respect and is useful in producing a model in rodents.  His approach is both by chemical and electron microscopy. He is also interested in determining catecholamine levels in brain tissue, GABA levels and more interesting, receptor binding properties. So far his results have not turned up anything, but the potential certainly is there.  The application is a little on the thin side, but in some ways it is refreshing. I get the impression that this man is young and relatively untried, having worked primarily with his sponsors at New York University.

USA  “To whom correspondence should be addressed  Methylation of catecholestrogens catalyzed by catechol- O-methyltransferase provides a major route for the rapid metabotic clearance of these steroids. However, the metabolic clearance rate of 4-hydroxyestradio! (4-OH-E,) is consider- ably lower than that of 2-hydroxyestradiol, although 2- and <@-hydroxycatechotestrogens (2- and 4-OH-CE) have similar apparent affinities for the enzyme. To determine the reason for this apparent paradox we have examined whether the efficiency of O-methylation of 4-OH-E, could be affected by other catecholestrogens or their G-methyi ethers. The ratio of 4-methoxyestradio!:4-hydroxyestradiol 3-methy) ether was 2.6 at pH 8.5, the pH optimum for the reaction. ‘The O-methyiation of 4-0H-E, (apparent X,, 210.41) was inhibited by 2-hydroxyestradio! (2-OH-E;) but not by 2- or <@-methoxyestrogens, The values for K,,, Vm, a5 well as the slope for the methylation of 4-OH-E, were altered by 2-OH-E, indicating a mixed inhibition. The inhibition constant for the intercept 1/V nay versus 2~OH-E, concen- trations and the inhibition constant for the slope versus 2~OH-E; concentrations were 3S and 5.7 2M, respectively. ‘The inhibition of O-methytation of 4-OH-E, by 2-OH-E, increased with the pH. In target tissues of the carcinogenic a@ction of estrogens such as the rat pituitary, hamster kidney, Or mouse uterus in which 2- and 4-OH-CE are both generated in almost equal amounts, the Inactivation of 4-<OQH-CE by O-methylation may be impeded. Consequently, 4-QH-E, would remain available as substrate for redox cycling, generation of active radicals and DNA damage.     fatsoduction  2-Hydroxycatecholeswrogens {2-OH-CE"), major oxidative Metabolites of primary estrogens in several mammalian species. have an extremely high metabolic clearance rate (MCR).

The MCR of 4-OH-CE ts much flower than that of 2-OH-CE (3.4) although 2- and 4-OH-CE have similar apparent affinities for COMT and the O-methylation of 2-OH-E; and 4-OH-E, in vitro, whether by purified COMT or cytosol. proceeds equally well (7.8). To deiermiine the reason for this apparent paradox we have examined whether the efficiency of O-methylation of 4-OH-CE could be affected by either 2-OH-CE or by the O-methylated products of 2- or 4-OH-CE. This question is of interest because of recent findings of equimolar 4-OH-CE and 2-OH-CE formation in several extrahepatic tissues (9— 13). In these organs, rat pituitary, Mouse uterus and hamster kidney. catecholestragens (CE) have been postulated to play 2 sole in estrogen-induced tumor formation (14.15). Elevated 4-hydroxylation of estrogen in these three targets of estrogen-induced cancer compared to hepatic 4-OH-CE synthesis suggests a carcinogenic role of these metabolites. since 4-GH-E, but not 2-OH-E, have been shown to induce renal turnors in hamsters (16). Protection of 4-OH-CE from inactivation by 2-OH-CE would either enhance or permit the ability of 4-OH-CE to exert endocrine and carcinogenic effects.  COMT generates two isomeric monomethyl ethers from each CE, i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-McO-E,) and 2-hydroxy- estradiot 3-methyl ether (2-OH-E,-3Me) from 2-OH-E, and 4-methoxyestradiol (4-MeO-E), and 4-hydroxyestradiol 3-methy! ether (4-OH-E;-3Mc} from 4-OH-E, (17) (Figure 11. In the case of 2-OH-~CE, large differences in ratios of 2-MeO-E;:2-OH-E,-3Me have been repored when they were assayed in vitro (t:1). in broken cell preparations or intact cells (30:1) [reviewed by Knuppen (17)]. There are no corresponding data on the influence of assay conditions on the ratios of the two monomethyl ethers of 4-OH-CE. Therefore, before examining any inhibitory effects on the COMT-catalyzed O-methylation of 4-OH-CE we established the characteristics of the formation of the two monomethy! ethers of 4-OH-E..

DATE: September 25, 1975 MEDIA: — i CLIENT; VANTAGE | SIZE:  JOB NO.: Al101-532 ISSUE:     THE SWITCHER'S GUIDE TO LOW 'TAR' AND NICOTINE CIGARETTES.  With all the controversy about smoking going on, lots of smokers would like nothing better than to switch to low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes, After all, when you like smoking too much to quit, switching to a low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette is a realistic alternative.  But which low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette should a switcher switch to? ,  Well, for every smoker who has ever considered switching, here's an easy guide to low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes.  First, there are super low, low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes. They're fine if low numbers are all you want. Because their scientific filters work so well, they just about filter out all the taste.  Next. The low 'tar' and nicotine cigarettes that claim to deliver flavor, If you've ever tasted one of them, you've probably been disappointed. Empty promises and empty taste, That's what these cigarettes are made of,  Finally, there's Vantage. The low 'tar’ and nicotine cigarette that's different from all the others.  Vantage isn't a watered down version of a cigarette. Because from the very beginning, Vantage was specially engineered to deliver flavor like a full-flavor cigarette, Without anywhere near the 'tar' and nicotine.  So if you'd like to switch to a low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette, try Vantage first. You might save yourself a lot of searching. Because Vantage will probably turn out to be the only low 'tar' and nicotine cigarette you'll enjoy smoking. __label__Advertisement

REVIEW & OUTLOOK Rethinking Risk     When the new Republican Con- gress convenes in January, one of the top priorities ought to be relling back what Lamar Alexander calls the “Waxman State’’—the torrent of rues and reguiations enacted into law by the likes of Congressman Henry Wax- man (D., Hollywood}. This is an espe- cially pressing priority in the environ- mental arena, where Congress and various executive branch agencies have spent years passing onerous rules to deal with negligible or nonex- istent risks.  Environmental regulation is the source of much public outrage nowa- days. Often the rules are a tangled meéss because Congress's underlying  legisiation vas complex in its goals °  and impossibly vague in how to meet those goals. The real rule-making was left to the bureaucracies, which in (urn produced their own Rube Gold- bergian complexity. Now comes evi- dence from a most unlikely source— the government itself~to support the contention that environmental spend- ing bears little if any relation to the real risks faced dy the public.  —» The Department of Energy has  just released a report titled ‘“‘Choices in Risk Assessment,’ prepared by a Nonprofit Teseareh group. The agency has good reason to study the subject: It could spend $300 billion to S1 trillion over the next 36 years cleaning up waste sites. Does the sci- entific policy behind those cleanups— and other federal actions—stand up to scrutiny?  The report delivers some clear an- swers: ‘Most environmental risks are so smail or indistinguishable that their existence cannot be proven,” Scientific policy is “inherently biased and can be designed to achieve prede- términed regulatory outcomes.'’ “‘Pol- i¢ymakers, the media and the public are unaware of the role of science pol- iey because of a lack of full and fair @sclosure.”"  * Consider just one example: the Oc- cupational Safety and Eealth Admin- istration is now proposing sweeping indoor air-quality regulations that would inciude a ban on all workplace smoking. But according to “Choices,"* a-major part of this policy—estimated to.cost the private sector $8 billion an- oally—is based on a one-page, hand- written chart that has never been pub- lished or peer-reviewed.  The “Chaices'' report praises the government for not banning the fluo-  ridation of water, unleaded gasoline ! and used oil. for which some evidence | of risk exists, but which on balance do far more good than harm, The report asks why similar decisions haven’t been reached about other alleged dan- gers. For example, when the EPA tried to ban asbestos, it took into ac- count only the product’s hypothetical! cancer risk—not the many lives that would be lost if nonasbestos brakes are substituted on cars,  There's simply no rhyme or reason behind federal environmental policy. £ven the ‘one chance in a million” standard used by many agencies to define a minimum level of cancer risk turns out to have mo scientific basis. Kathryn Kelly, a Seattle environmen- tal consultant, reports in the newslet- ter EPA Watch that this standard was basically plucked out of a hat by the FDA in the 1970s to regulate animal drug residues. Now it's employed for everything from hazardous waste sites to pesticides—even though scien- tists have generaily concluded that risks of Iess than one in a thousand can’t even be quantified. i  ‘It’s insane that we're spending hundreds of billions of dollars chasing imagined risks,"* Steve Milloy, author of.“Choices,” tells us.  The road to sanity starts with more rational risk/cost-benefit analysis. Bills to accomplish that goal were in- troduced in the last Congress but got nowhere because of opposition from Democratic barons. Now that there are new Kings of the Hill, swift action is expected on this front.  But the new Republican majority     should be careful about the language ‘be  of cost-benefit bills. As “Choices” points out, many risk-analysis ideas have already been implemented via executive order—to no effect. What's needed ts legislation with teeth—set out clearly what standards bureau- crats should follow, and give compa- : nies and focal governments the right to sue if regulators get out of line. GOP Sen. Trent Lott. the new Majority Whip. has introduced a draft proposal along these lines, and Rep. Dan Mica (R., Fla.) will probably follow suit.  Passage of their plans would be a first step toward dismantling the | crushing cost burden of the Waxman State, which surely played aroleinthe ! voters’ recent decision to part ways with the Democratic Party.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: . Mr. A. I. Palmer Date: January 25, 1989 From: . R. W. Dwyer Subject: . Concentric Filter Design - Clarification of D455  Recently, FTR has shown an interest in concentric CA filters. They believe that a filter which delivers peripheral smoke preferentially will have an enhanced subjective impact. This belief is based on the concept that more flavorful smoke is generated at the periphery of the combustion zone, and this smoke travels the length of the cigarette without appreciable  mixing with the core smoke.  In an attempt to exploit this behavior, Chris Campbell and I have developed an idea for a filter design which should increase the preferential delivery of peripheral smoke. The problem with a conventional concentric filter, in which both sections contain the same material, is that each section will have a characteristic resistance to flow. This means that the flowing smoke will partition itself between the two sections in proportion to their resistances. Therefore, the core and peripheral smokes will mix at the rod/filter interface as the esistance.             Our idea is to construct concentric filters with two different  materials, one Bm pressure drop. A concentric filter could be constructed such that both the core and peripheral sections ‘have the same resistances to flow. This  insures that there would be no mixing of the peripheral and core smokes at  the filter entrance. Once the smoke enters the filter sections, the one  with the higher efficiency will remove more of its fraction of the smoke, thereby leading to a preferential delivery from the lower efficiency section. Thus, if the lower efficiency section is at the periphery, the smoke emerging from the filter would have a higher concentration of  peripheral smoke.                 We have several materials at hand for constructing such filters. The lower-efficiency section can be made from CA filter tow, while the more efficient section can be constructed from paper, CA web, or ultra-low denier  polypropylene fibers. ———e—       /y1 i ec: Campbell. .

A  oo personal sampling pump was calibrated with an in-line Millipore  AA 0.8 micron filter at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. An eight-hour sample was taken on October 28, 1986 as per NIOSH --- asbestos method R&CAM239. The absolute sensitivity of the method was 0.1 fiber/cm” of gir. The present permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 0.2 fiber/cm” of air. Upon completion of the survey,  the filter cassette was sealed, labelled and transferred to the Analytical Development section for qualitative microscopic  - analysis.  A portion of the membrane filter was mounted and analyzed by an ISI Super III Scanning Electron Microscope for the physical appearance of the trapped particulates (1). No asbestiform fibrous materials were found. Cellulosic paper particles, as noted in Figures 1 and 2, and paper filler particles noted in Figures 3 and 4 were the predominant species.

Smith, Ph.D.  It is with great pleasure that we announce Dr. Carr Smith’s promotion to Senior Staff Scientist in Research & Development. Carr has been with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company since 1986, performing a variety of critical functions for the Company. He has been in the Product Evaluation Group since November 1992. Over the past eighteen months, his work in meeting the objectives  of the Product Evaluation Group, formerly the Biological Research Group, has been exemplary. We are pleased to recognize Carr’s efforts with this promotion.  One of the major things that Carr has been able to accomplish in the brief time he has worked with us is to initiate a program in the area of human cardiovascular disease. Carr has accepted the challenge to build this program and has made significant progress to reach his goal. He has carefully reviewed the literature and written several review articles on the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease. One major conclusion is that the cardiovascular risks of smoking and nicotine use have been grossly exaggerated by individuals outside the Company. These articles are being submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. Additionally, Carr has been actively involved in studies with smokers to support product development efforts. Carr’s depth of knowledge in human clinical studies is invaluable to all of us. He has been a critical participant in our continuing efforts to bring scientific rigor to the question of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke. Carr was actively involved in responding to the EPA and he has a key role in our current attempts to educate OSHA on the scientific facts.  In summary, Carr Smith has been and is performing at a level consistent with the duties and responsibilities of a Senior Staff Scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. We are delighted to have him as part of our team. We look forward to his continuing efforts to provide balance in scientific discussions of the biological activity of tobacco smoke, particularly in the area of cardiovascular disease. Please join us as we congratulate Carr on his achievements.  J. Don deBethizy “We work for smokers avid J. Doolittle  Bowman Gray Technical Center     OSPE C9OTS __label__Letter

The previous competitive test (August, 1981) showed WINSTON Ultra Lights 85 to be at parity with Merit Ultra Lights 85 among the current action standard smokers. This previous test was fielded when WINSTON Ultra Lights had white tipping versus Merit's cork tipping. The WINSTON Ultra Lights tested for this report is the new product with cork tipping and a new blend which began pro- duction in late February, 1982.  Action Standard  Superiority versus Merit Ultra Lights 85 among male 25-34 LT NM 80-85mm competitive smokers (excluding WINSTON Lights 85).  Conclusions  e® WINSTON Ultra Lights 85 was rated superior (meeting its action standard) versus Merit Ultra Lights 85:  %$ 7O+ WINSTON Ultra Merit Ultra Smokers Lights 85 Lights 85 LT NM Target Competitive 38  @ WINSTON Ultra Lights 85 was given favorable ratings for its greater strength and ideal mildness (Merit Ultra Lights was rated too mild). The WINSTON product was also judged to be more satisfying, more natural tasting, and having more rich taste. WINSTON Ultra Lights 85 was not judged to have any product weaknesses ‘versus Merit Ultra Lights 85.  © Relative to consumer wants, WINSTON Ultra Lights 85 could be improved by increasing strength, smoothness, and tobacco taste.

MICRO MARKETING PLAN  Background sf log In today’s environment, traditional mass marketing approaches with nationally oriented programs are becoming less and less effective. This could be explained in part by the fact that today’s smokers are far more fragmented in terms of lifestyle and product wants. Smokers have become > increasingly sophisticated and discriminating in their product choices. In addition, the retail environment is increasingly fragmented both in terms of types/number of outlets and the goods/services they provide their shoppers.  The result has been an explosion in the number of brands ; offered to smaller and smaller targets creating tremendous  clutter within traditional mass vehicles. Another result is _  wasted resources. As traditional mass spending approaches. are used, significant marketing resources are wasted against non-prospects in order to reach target smokers with a substantial level of impact. _  The traditional mass marketing approach may become even less important to the Company in the future for several reasons. The potential for advertising restrictions has increased. Restrictions may vary in form and severity by geography. This indicates the importance of local advertising/media __ flexibility. Retail marketing restrictions are less likely, therefore making the point-of-purchase an even more important advertising and promotional opportunity in the future. - RJRT has merchandising and overall presence strength to be leveraged in the retail environment. PM’s efforts to compromise this position is récognition of the value placed on the Micro retail marketing potential. The power of retail chains is growing, especially at the local level. This suggests the opportunity to adapt/tailor retail programs to exploit local retail opportunities.  A Micro Marketing approach to our business will provide RJRT the opportunity to tailor national brand strategies to specific smoker sub-segments based on lifestyle interests, geography, and retail opportunities. oe  Retail outlets will be classified on a consumer-driven basis. Segmentation will occur as outlets are classified on individual store purchase patterns.  Along with retail segmentation, smokers will be identified and segmented into homogeneous groups with something important in common such as ethnicity, key lifestyle interests, or geographical location.

Draft submissions from Machinists tobacco locals to FDA  Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305) Food and Drug Administration  Room i-23  12420 Parklawn Drive  Rockville, MD 20857  RE: 95N-0253 (Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products)  On behalf of Machinists Locai (local number), | am wating to express our strong opposition to the proposed reguiation of tobacco products by the FDA.  The proposed regulations, taken in their entirety, will certainly lead to much more severe controls on the use of tobacco products by adults. They go right at the economic viability of the tobacco industry and in tum the livelihood of our members whose jobs depend on the industry  What is most outrageous is that rarely in ail of the cebate over tobacco regulation is there ever a mention of the jobs of thousands of hard working men and women whose livelihoods depend on the tobacco industry. The excellent wages and benetits we eam enable us to provide for our families. send our children to college, care for our parents. grandparents and grandchildren.  Because of these wages and benefits, we bolster the standard of living and quality of life in our community. Tobacco industry workers will not be the only ones hurt by this attack on the tobacco industry. The people who work in the businesses we patronize--ihe restaurants, grocery stores, appliance shops, hairdressers and car dealers to name a tew-- will pay a high price as weil for these misguided and punitive regulation.  Our union agrees that teen smoking is an important issue that should be addressed. But regulating away thousands of jobs is not the answer. States are already required by federal law to pass legisiation restricting access of tobacco products to minors. Our union and the industry support these efforts.  Tobacco is a legal product produced by American workers and should continue to be treated as such. A percentage of American adults will choose to use tobacco products.  TI1686-0527 __label__Letter

Clements, April H, 1988  ABSTRACT _ To facilitate understanding of the mecha- nisms underlying pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer and cystic fibrosis, we have transformed and characterized cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells. Cells were trans- fected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a plasmid containing a replication-defective simian virus 40 (SV40) ge- nome. Colonies of cells with enhanced growth potential were isolated and analyzed for transformation- and epithelial- specific characteristics. Precrisis cells were observed to express the SV40 large tumor antigen, produce cytokeratins, have microvilli, and form tight junctions. After crisis, cells contin- ued to express the SV40 large tumor antigen as well as epithelial-specific cytokeratins and to display the apical mem- brane microvilli. Apical membrane C] channels were opened in postcrisis cells exposed to 50 4M forskolin. These channels showed electrical properties similar to those observed in primary cultures. The postcrisis cells have been in culture for >250 generations and are potentially ‘‘immortal.”’ In addition to providing a useful i# vitro model for the study of ion transport by human airway epithelial cells, the cells can be used to examine stages of neoplastic progression.     Recent studies investigating mechanisms of carcinogenesis have shown that cultured human epithelial cells from various organs can be transformed by exposure to carcinogens, viruses, and/or oncogenes (for reviews, see refs. 1 and 2). Such cells possess altered growth properties that can be correlated with their neoplastic potential. Foreskin and mammary epithelial cells treated with chemicals or radiation show enhanced growth capacity (3, 4), Human keratinocytes (5) have been immortalized with Harvey murine sarcoma virus (v-Ha-ras). Human keratinocytes, immortalized with adenovirus type 12/simian virus 40 (Ad12/SV40) hybrid virus, become tumorigenic after subsequent exposure to the Kirsten ras (KRAS) oncogene or a chemical carcinogen (6, 7).  In contrast to the relatively large number of studies describing cells from other organs (recently reviewed in refs. 1 and 2), only three reports indicate transformation of respiratory tract cells (8-10). Bronchial epithelial cells im- mortalized with v-Ha-ras display anchorage-independent growth and form tumors in nude mice. However, these cells were poorly differentiated and did not contain tight junctions or keratins characteristic of differentiated epithelial cells. The epithelial origin of the cells was verified by the presence of keratin. A somewhat greater level of differentiation was retained by diethylnitrosamine-transformed fetal tracheal cells, which contained mucin. These cells also expressed carcinoembryonic antigen and wool merokeratin and had enhanced, although limited, growth capacity (9). A third study primarily described methods for transfection and     The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment, This article must therefore be hereby marked ‘‘advertisement”’ in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §1734 solely to indicate this fact.     5951  showed expression of the SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen) three to four subcultures posttransfection (10).  A goal of the present study was to develop a transformed human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cell line for detailed studies of the mechanisms regulating Cl ion transport. This aspect of epithelial function is essential for rehydration of airway mucus. Abnormalities in the Cl conductance pathway also appear critical to disease processes such as those occurring in cystic fibrosis (11, 12).  Phenotypic characteristics have been well maintained in S¥40-transformed fibroblasts (13-15). In SV40-transformed epithelial cells (16-19), certain aspects of phenotype are retained better than others (17, 18, 20, 21). A plasmid containing a 5V40 genome defective in the origin of replica- tion (pSVori~) has been shown to enhance the transforma- tion efficiency of human fibroblasts (22). The defective origin of replication precludes background virus replication and eliminates the possibility of cell death or interference with phenotypic expression in the host cell due to uncontrolled viral DNA synthesis or production of viral particles. We have used the pSVori~ plasmid to transform HTE cells. Trans- formed cells pass through a period of ‘‘crisis,”’ after which phenotype may change and loss of certain differentiated functions may occur (21, 23). We have analyzed both pre- and postcrisis cells. Biochemical and morphological analyses reveal that the cells retain some aspects of the original phenotype even after crisis. These include the presence of microvilli, responsiveness to neural agonists, keratin produc- tion, and Cl ion transport.  METHODS  Cells and Culture Conditions. Cells were isolated from trachea, as described, by enzymatic digestion (24) or as outgrowths from tracheal tissue explants. Cells were plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin (Collaborative Research, Waltham, MA), Vitrogen (GIBCO), and bovine serum albu- min. Cultures were grown in LHC-8e medium (25) at 37°C under 5% CO,/95% air.  Pure cultures of epithelial cells were generated by elim- inating contaminating fibroblasts through selective detach- ment (26). Pure cultures of epithelial cells were grown to 70% or 80% confluence before subculturing into 100-mm Petri dishes.  Transformation, The pSVori~ plasmid was amplified in bacteria and then isolated after banding on CsCtI density gradients (27). Since the transfection efficiency is increased in linearized plasmids (22), pSVori~ was linearized with Xho I at a unique restriction enzyme site distal to the transforming genes in the SV40 portion of the plasmid. The plasmid was cut in a region distant to the SV40 genes to minimize endogenous exonuclease damage to genes essential for transformation.

D. deBethizy, M. F. Borgerding, D. J. Doolittle, J. H. Robinson, K. T. McManus, C. A. Rahn, R. A. Davis, G. T. Burger, J. H. Reynolds and A. W. Hayes that we would like you to consider for publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. The manuscript has been approved by all of the authors.  Our manuscript describes a series of studies which evaluated the smoke chemistry and biological activity of a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco which was developed by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The significant findings reported were large reductions in the yields of many chemicals from the new cigarette and that these reductions were associated with a reduction in urine mutagenicity in smokers. A recent editorial by Dr. Neal A. Benowitz that appeared in the June 15, 1989 issue of the Journal called for a "worldwide attempt to reduce the yields of toxic substances and to make the yield of all cigarettes as low as possible." Our studies demonstrate that a cigarette that heats  rather than burns tobacco can achieve substantial reductions in the yields of many compounds.  The manuscript has been reviewed by Dr. Peter Dews from Harvard Medical School, Dr. Robert Neal from Vanderbilt and Dr. Martin Cline from the UCLA School of Medicine. All three reviewers felt that the studies described in this manuscript would be of great interest to the vast majority of medical professionals. They wholeheartedly recommended that we submit the paper to the New England Journal of Medicine.  We suggest the following reviewers based on their experience and  G66e 6L60S __label__Letter

The FTC method is the standard procedure for establishing nicotine and tar delivery for each cigarette smoked,  The use of cotinine plasma level determinations obtained from smokers under established smoking conditions allows for comparison between predicted values for plasma cotinine and observed values. Using the kinetic equations described in Part I and the sequential solution computer model, it is possible to arrive at a predicted plasma Jevel for cotinine based upon cigarette consumption utilizing labeled value for nicotine delivery. With establishment of the mathematical relationship between observed and predicted continine values, it is possible to estimate the average delivery for each cigarette smoked. Figures 7 through 4  provide a histogram of the average delivery for the brands studies. Figures 5  265920T0S  and 6 illustrate the variation in number of cigarettes smoked per day for the     different brands studied. The diary values were used to construct these histograms.     Since smoking patterns varied within days for each smoker, it is possible that  these values may not reflect exact values for use with the computer model.     501026597 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Report

oriliud  MEMORANDUM  July 7, 1994  TO: W. C. Baylies From: E. F. DeLaura  RE: Topline: Current Harley Lights Box 80’s Vs.  Proto Harley Lights Box 80’s In-Home Product Test MPID #5545/294 eyo  This presents the topline results for the In-Home product test conducted for the prototype Harley Lights Box 80’s versus the current Harley Lights Box 80’s.  Background  When producing the Harley Light Box 80’s product, R&D was confronted with significant manufacturing problems.  Specifically, the current box product was not found to be close enougc in taste characteristics to that of tne 85’s sott pack version. Additionally, the box product varied as R&D had trouble maintaining the product’s specifications.  Thus, R&D developed a revised Harley Lights Box product that employed a new filter which enabled the prototype to have taste characteristics that were closer to the king size Harley Lights.  Please note, since the time this study was initiated, R&D has resolved the manufacturing problem and is now producing a  consistent box 80’s product that successfully meets product specifications.  Objective  The Action Standard set for this study was a parity or better  performance for the prototype versus the current Harley Lights Box 80’s product among Marlboro Lights Box 80’s smokers.

<b  improvement.     EXHIBIT II OO May 31, 1979  Market Research Report #77-1290  Promotion Department Perspective SUBJECT: ESTABLISHED BRAND SAMPLING STUDY  This provides the Promotion Department's perspective on the attached Corporate Sampling research report. It positions the study, draws key conclusions on sampling in support of established brands, and focuses on indicated action.  This learning is being applied to established brand sampling Planning.  Background  The primary role of promotion is to gain trial of our brands by competitive brand smokers. The purpose of this trial is to support follow-up purchase and regular usage among the competitive triers.  In 1977 the Company was relying solely on couponing to promote trial on our existing brands. We needed other promotion approaches that could effectively gain trial, especially by younger adults and males who are less likely to redeem coupons. Because of this, the Promotion Department established an objective of learning how to use sampling to improve our existing brand business. Sample 4's were being used to support selected new brands.  This study was our initial effort to determine the effect of sam- pling smokers with our existing brands. In order to gain an indi- cation of the low side and high side potential of sampling, we measured mass sampling, which we felt was inadequate, and a repre- sentative high impact approach. Mass sampling intercepted pedes- trians, reaching any adult accepting the sample (sample 4's and full pack 20's. were used). The high impact approach selectively sampled category smokers with a full carton or more by mail.  In reading this perspective and the attached research report, you Should remember that the study does not measure sampling the way we are conducting it now. Since the study was fielded we have moved to sample 20's based on preliminary results from the study. Also, on judgment, we commenced jointly sampling menthol and non- menthol brands, and targeting styles to category smokers. The study does provide information to confirm the value of the improve-~- ments that were made and to identify further opportunities for  Additional background is provided in the attached exhibits:  Exhibit I ~ Criteria for guiding sampling development.

At least, that’s what a group of farmers, oe economists and burley cooperative leaders thought when they first gathered last spring at a meeting” called by Berea’s Community Farm Alli- ance. Since then. the group has been knitting together pieces of the future.  The group has produced the outline of 2 plan. a 27-page document being quietly cwrcuiated around the South.

New Jersey Cigarette Tax Overview - 25 cent/pack increase  An additional 25 cent/pack cigarette tax would increase the state’s tax to 65 cents/pack and make New Jersey’s cigarette tax the ninth highest in the country and almost twice the national  average (37 cents per pack).  Many studies show excise taxes -- especially “sin” taxes -- are particularly regressive in their effect on modest to low-income people. In fact, a 1997 Peat Marwick study that households that make under $30,000 a year pay 47% of all tobacco taxes. Without doubt, those who can least afford the tax will be hit the hardest.  In 1991, when New Jersey increased cigarette taxes by 13 cents/pack, cigarette sales collapsed by 12 percent. At the same time (1991-1996), Delaware’s sales increased by 15 percent. This is a pattem seen in many states. People don’t quit smoking when taxes are raised, they simply change their buying habits.  After a 25 cent/pack tax hike, New Jersey consumers could save $6.50 per carton on New York Indian reservations, $5.50 per carton in Delaware, and $3.40 per carton in Pennsylvania. In addition, New Jersey’s otherwise law-abiding citizens could save $6.00/carton by buying cigarettes in North Carolina and $6.25/carton in Virginia.  According to the National Association of Convenience Stores, many retailers, especially small “mom and pop” stores, rely on tobacco for as much as 30 percent of their yearly profits.  It is estimated that New Jersey’s 1,700 convenience stores alone stand to lose $74 million in cigarette sales and $56 million in sundry product sales (sales of other products) if cigarette taxes are increased 25 cent/pack.  Gross profits, or the value added, lost to New Jersey convenience stores because of increased cigarette taxes could be about $27 million or $15,800 per store.  The American Economics Group (AEG) estimates that a 25 cent increase will reduce New Jersey’s cigarette volume by 93 million packs.  A 25 cent/ pack cigarette tax hike could lead to a $350 million commercial loss for New Jersey that includes:  - $195 million in lost cigarette sales; - $156 million in lost tie-in or sundry product sales; and  - $73 million in gross profits for retailers and wholesalers.

PARK 500  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  CHESTER, VIRGINIA Phy, Conta January 22 Mong yl To: Distribution “BC From: J.R. nirrey th Subject: Pulper Discharge Pumps - Line 3  Status  A plan to test two alternative types of stators on the Line 3 Netzsch Pulper discharge pumps (memo attached for ref.) was ap- proved and the purchase requisition submitted in mid-December.  As part of the recently implemented Omnibus purchasing process, these items now must be ordered from Netzsch through Ferguson En- terprises rather than from the local Netzsch factory rep., Wood Equipment. I was informed by Wood’s sales rep. Friday 1/14/94 that the order had not been placed. According to Ferguson, as of 1/21/94, the stators are on order and delivery will be expedited. Ordinarily delivery is 6-8 weeks.  Recommendation:  I would like to add an additional evaluation to this testing plan. This would be to install one of the next larger size of the Netzch pump (Model NE90A) on Line 3 for a direct comparison with the existing smaller model (NE80A). This would enable us to determine if the larger pump is worth the additional cost in terms of extending pump life. The existing drive and motor from the smaller pump can be reused so the primary difference between the two models is the stator and rotor size. The additional cost  per pump (with the standard Ethylene Propylene (EP) stator and 316 SS rotor) is $1908.     2030016727 __label__Memo

Such changes have undoubtedly been achieved in some groups under regular surveillance over short pe- nods, but long-term dietary compliance in the mul- uple risk factor intervention trial may have been less than intended and an earher American study also ran into trouble because of poor compliance (11). These difficulties are much better acknow!- edged and grappled with than swept under the car- pet. The possibility, at least, that moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of IHD is one that poses obvious difficulties, but there is no point in pretending that it docs not exist.

In its issue of 3 July 1983, the Sundar Times laid bare a series of events within the Department of Health's advisory machinery which, even if they were only half trae, would be deplorable. In 1979, the Government set up a National Advisory Committee on Nutrition Educa- tion. A subcommittee was appointed to recom- mend nutritional guidelines for health education in Britain many of which are, of course, concerned with IHD. Besides making specific roposals, the report *pparently recognized the difficulties the food industry would face and consequently sug. gested a prolonged time-scale over which changes could be made. By all accounts, the subcommittee’s report was well received by the parent committee.

Kaplan  — Risk factor intervention does work  Professor Oliver uses data from the US multiple risk factor intervention trial as evidence for his argue ment that mass interventions to reduce risk factors have not worked and ought to be given up.  The data from this trial, in fact, show just the opposite (7). The rates of coronary mortality were much reduced in both groups, the half given special interventions and the half returned to their usual sources of medical cate. The desipners of the study assumed that the risk factors among the “usual care"’ group would change very little, preserving the statistical likelihood thar 187 coronary deaths would occur among them. They calculated that a much greater reduction in isk factors among the “special interventions” group would reduce their projected number of coronary deaths to 137, thus providing a 27% difference that would be statisti- cally significant.  What then happened proved that risk factor intervention does work, contrary to Oliver's inter: pretation.

According to Article 64 of National Health Insurance Law, Legislators suggested to impose an “ear-marked tax” for tobacco products as gocial health insurance surcharge.  According to Public Health Institute Professor Yang Min-chin, smoking related diseases occasioned some 4 billion NTS medical expenses annually; its indirect cost could amount to as high as 46 billion NTS every year. Therefore, it would be fair for smokers paying higher price to share this social cost.  Professor Hu The-wei of US Berkeley Health Economics Research Institute analyzed that most advanced countries often imposed very high cigarette tax ranging fram 60% to 80%, Tatwan’s 47%  tte tax was comparatively lower, and as « reauylt, Taiwan's everage Cigarette price was much lower than world average at US$1.3 per pack.  The DOH deemed the suggestion of imposing “oar-matked tax” being nice, however, smokers’ Teaction would have to be taken into consideration. With little price increase on cigarette pack, the move would be acceptable more easily by amokers.  vILelLePooz  However, part of smokers reckoned that SHPL already strictly limited their right of smoking, imposing an “ear-marked tax” would be to cast additional stone on a person already in great difficulry. Smokers proclaimed that their rights end interests should also be respected. Some smokers agreed on “earemarked tax” Proposal but deemed the income should be utilized for developing smoking rehabilitation measures, pharmaceutical products that smokers could benefit from.

March 9, 1984  TO: Mr. J. G. Tobin  FROM: S. Kaufman  RE: NoW 100 FRANCHISE RISK STUDY  This reports topline results of the NOW Franchise Risk Study. The objectives of this research were to:  e Determine NOW's franchise familiarity with the brand's tar level. In addition, among franchise smokers who correctly playback its tar level, measure the relative level of dissatisfaction associated with increasing the product's tar level to 3mg even though it will deliver more taste  and retain its “lowest” positioning.  @ Determine why recent NOW 100 switchers “switched” to other brands, Should the primary reason focus on poor taste delivery (e.g., not enough taste), this would further support the case for increasing the brand's tar level from 2 to 3mg.  A. Pranchise Smokers     Approximately 62% of NOW's franchise were able to playback the brand's current 2mg tar level, However, this number may be slightly inflated as the tar level is written on the pack and respondents may have looked at it  during the interview,  Aware of Tar Level*  img tar 5.0% 3mg tar 1.7% 4-5mg tar 3.7% Under Img tar 9.6% Don't know / 17.9%  *Question What is the tar level, in milligrams, of NOW 100 cigarette?     Although there is high awareness of tar content, increasing the tar level from 2 to 3mg to provide greater taste delivery (while still being the “lowest 100's“jappears to pose minimal risk to the brand. Only 13% of the respondents claimed they would switch to another brand.        ZTEOR LhHEas __label__Report
THE THEATRE  :New Plays in Manhattan  ' The: Male Animal (by James Thurber & Elliott Nugent; produced by Herman Shumlin) provides Broadway—in a season tich only in comedy-—with another comedy hit. A frail, rachitic tyke of a play, with barely enough clothes to cover it, The Male Animal manages to captivate by its impish tongue and winning smile. It re- sembles a dinner party where there isn’t nearly enough food but where the conver- sation is so amusing that nobody minds.  . James Thurber, famous for iustrating The War Between the Sexes with his run-  James THurzer (SELF-PORTRAIT) Good conversation, not enough food,  away pencil, has curried the combat to the stage. The Male Animal tells of a young English professor (Elliott Nugent) .who has all the trouble that Thucher thinks the male animal is born to. The prof gets branded a Red for wanting to read one of Vanzetti’s letters to his class. He gets all tingled up with his wife when an old sweetheart of hers comes to town for a football game. A Milquefoast by nature, the professor’ quaiis too much of the cup that emboldens, and in 2 hilarious drunk scene decides to hold his mate as bull ele- phants, swans, land crabs do—by fighting for her. He does hold her, but not with his fists; it turns out that the old beau's interest is only pigskin deep.  The Male Animal serves up its bit of plot successively as roast turkey, creamed turkey, turkey hash, scraps, soup, and bones for the dog. Fortunately, Play- wright Thurber’s insane, melancholy stant on life fills the play with fresh and free- flowing laughter. Frustration is leavened jnto nonsense, indignation is alkalized by good nature. Admirably cast and directed by Producer Shumlin, The Male Animal js a gay evening in the theatre in spite of being no play at all.  John Henry (by Roark Braslford; music by Jacques Wolfe; produced by Sam Byrd) took Paul Robeson back to Broadway after nearly eight years. The stage seemed set for a great return.

Reynolds Tobacco Company as requested by the Commission on April 13, 1983. We appreciate this Opportunity to comment.  We urge as a first priority that the Commission immediately adopt a modification in methodology to adjust for the new variable introduced into cigarette “tar" and nicotine testing by "Barclay-type" or "bypass" filters. The Commission's inquiry into "bypass" filters has lasted long enough. It is time for. action and results.  R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has not yet finalized its position on Question 7, which raises broad questions concerning "smoker compensation." In passing, however, two points should be made on this subject. First, no two smokers will smoke cigarettes in the same manner. In fact, the same smoker will rarely smoke any two cigarettes in the same manner. Therefore, as the Commission itself has frequently noted, it is impossible to replicate human smoking in all its varieties. For the Commission to allow further delay in adjusting its methodology for "by- pass" filters while it attempts to resolve the myriad questions related to "compensation" and human smoking would be unthinkable.

Each Division Manager (along with your RM if he reports to you), and each Key Account Manager (along with the input from your AM’s) should be prepared to explain to the group your recommended Plan on how to utilize our new contract signing to solve the region’s product availability problem as it relates to promoted product, retailers waiting for the SR’s to place orders and the out-of-stocks that occur.  Can we use this contract resigning as “Leverage” to solve this problem? Food for Thought:  ® Is it time to change the region policy to ..... all promoted product must be placed on temporary displays and only non-promoted  product will be placed in our permanent displays?  Q) Can we as region truly implement 9 weeks of discount promotion  and then turn it off for 4 weeks ..... with non-promoted “Full” displays?  QC) When we resign all accounts to our new contract .... can we require that a certain number of required brands “MUST” be instock at all times .... or deletion of payment will be made?  1 How do we keep our priority brands in stock .... at all times?  ul B o vl e S 9 ~ an __label__Letter

To:  From:  Subject:  I.  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION  Ms. R. D. Kinser Date: 14 February 1990  A. H. Warfield  Summary of 6908 Activities for 1989  Oriental Tobacco Studies  A.  A study of the effect of agronomic variables on preformed TSNA and MS. smoke TSNA from oriental tobacco was concluded. Samsun and bright (McNair 373) tobaccos were grown under bright conditions, and effects of topping, flue-curing and sun-curing were studied. When filler TSNA levels were taken into consideration, the agro- nomic variables had a very substantial influence on the transfer/ pyrosynthesis phenomena leading to the observed levels of TSNA in MS smoke.?® Sun-curing gave much lower levels of preformed TSNA than flue-curing. The lowest levels of MS TSNA relative to TPM were delivered by the sun-cured and not-topped Samsun tobacco.  A pilot study was carried out on the relationship of chemical characteristics of different oriental varieties to the levels of endogenous TSNA found and MS TSNA produced when corresponding  cigarettes were smoked. There were significant variations in both endogenous TSNA and MS TSNA among the three varieties. 27  Based on the results of the pilot study described above, an expanded study of eight oriental varieties was completed except for final data analysis. Wide ranges in the levels of various components were observed depending on the country of origin as well as grade designation in some cases. Only two varieties had levels of endogenous TSNA typical of those found in blended oriental fillers. Very low endogenous TSNA values were observed for the other varieties. The variety found to yield the highest level of MS TSNA was not the one which had the highest levels of endogenous: TSNA. 28  Samples of American Aromatic Tobacco (AAT) that were grown in 1985 under bright conditions with air-curing were obtained from Roger Bass (Project 2525). AAT originated from crosses between a South American tobacco, a bright variety, and a burley. The TSNA levels were lower than those found for a typical burley, but higher than those found normally for oriental. NAT levels were considerably higher than NNN levels in all these samples, while NNK levels were low as is normal for burley. Endogenous TSNA tended to be propor- tional to abienol levels in the five different crosses tested, with some exceptions. ?°®  EFIONOS8 207 __label__Memo

The information comes from the D&B — INTERNATIONAL DUN’S MARKET IDENTIFIERS {DIALOG: File 518} database, and the particular loca- tions were identified by selecting entries whose primary or secondary Standard Industrial Classification Code(s) included 8731 (Commercial physical research), 8732 (Commercial nonphysica! research), or 8733 (Noncommercial research organization), with an ultimate parent company in the United States. The tabular format was chosen since it is a convenient method of answesing the specific question of where else U.S. companies conduct research. It must be pointed out that the methods Dun & Brad- street uses to define and index locations keep certain facilities off the list; for instance, the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory is not found in this particular database.

P.I.: Emilia Oleszak, Ph.D. MOLECULAR MIMICRY BETWEEN Fc GAMMA RECEPTOR AND MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS PEPLOMER PROTEIN  Background. Molecular mimicry is defined as the presence of epitopes, either linear or conformational, shared between viral and host antigens (1) and may play a role in the pathogenesis of viral infections and the induction of autoimmune diseases. Several homolo- gous peptides between human myelin basic protein (MBP) and viral proteins have been idanti- fied including adenovirus, influenza, measles, canine distemper and Epstein-Barr viruses(2). Molecular mimicry of a peptide comprised of 8 amino acids of MBP by Hepatitis B polymerase (HBP) can cause autoimmune disease (3). Rabbits injected with this octapeptide developed experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)(3). We have demonstrated (4,5) molecular mimicry between Fc gamma receptor (FcyR) and the peplomer protein S (formerly E2) of the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV}.  MHV strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a member of the Coronavirus family, experimentally produces several diseases in mice and rats, depending on the dose and route of inoculation and the age and strain of the infected animals (7-10). MHV-JHM is highly neurotropic (6). Infection of susceptible mice causes fatal encephalomyelitis characterized by destruction of CNS neurons with prominent demyelination. Mice surviving encephalitis (5-10% of those infected) subsequently develop a persistent, demyelinating disease. The virus was found to persist in the nervous system and the demyelinating process is associated with primary infection of oligodendrocytes (7}. However, a relapsing-remitting demyelinating disease, reminiscent of multiple sclerosis has been reported (8). Furthermore, infection of rats or mice with MHV-JHM results in lymphocyte sensitization against MBP (9). Adoptive transfer of these lymphocytes after in vitro restimulation with MBP results in EAE. These results suggest that during MHV infection primary demyelination occurs by direct lysis of oligodendrocytes followed by induction of autoimmune response. Thus, this virus provides an excellent system for the study of the molecular basis of virus-induced demyelinating disease.  Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been implicated in protection from MHV infection. Anti-MHV-JHM antibodies prevent death from MHV-JHM infection, but they do not suppress viral replication in CNS (10,11). Furthermore, in the presence of antibodies MHV- JHM replicates mainly in oligodendrocytes but not in neurons (10). Delayed-type hypersensi- tivity ¥ cell clones also protects mice against lethal infection with MHV-JHM although, in agreement with the findings with antibodies, they do not inhibit virus replication in CNS (12). Additionally, cytotoxic T cells (13), cytolytic B cells (14,15) and NK cells (16) exhibit cytotoxic activity against MHV-JHM-infected cells. Recently, it has been reported that clearance of MHV-JHM from CNS requires both CD4* and CD8* cells (17).  The S peplomer protein is encoded by MHV mRNA 3 and is synthesized on ribosomes (18,19) as an 120 kD polypeptide.It is cotranstationally glycosylated to a 150 kD $ precursor which is subsequently further glycosylated to the 180 kD species. Two forms of the S protein are present on the surface of the virion, the 180 kD and its two non-identical cleaved products 90A kD and 908 kD. S is responsible for attachment of the virus to the host cell, MHV- induced cell fusion, and for eliciting neutralizing antibodies (20,21). Therefore, the peplomer S protein plays a central role in the outcome of MHV infections. We have demonstrated molecular mimicry between FcyR and the peplomer protein S of MHV (4,5).  Infection with herpes virus (HSV-1) resulted in the expression on the cell surface of molecules with Fe binding ability (22,23). The IgG Fc-binding receptors induced by HS¥-1] are formed by a complex of viral glycoproteins g& and gl (g70). Recently it has been reported (24) that HSV-1 FcR has a novel function: it participates in antibody bipolar bridging. This has been described as the binding of a single anti-viral IgG molecule by its Fab end to a viral epitope and by its Fc end to an Fe receptor. It was demonstrated (24) that bipolar bridging of immune IgG protects the virus from antibody and complement- dependent neutralization and, therefore, offers a survival advantage to the virus.  40040832 __label__Scientific

PRELIMINARY APPLICATION CHARACTERIZATION AND ROLE OF ECTO-ADP-RIBOSYLTRANSFERASE IN  LYMPHOCYTE.ACTIVATION -  1, Background and Significance. T lymphocytes play a vital role in the defense against viral and bacterial  invaders as well as malignant cells that arise from host tissues. The biochemical mechanisms they use to interact with their immediate environment enable them to respond to a variety of different extracellular stimuli to mount an effective immune response. For example, this can take the form of localizing to a specific area of inflammation via binding of cell adhesion molecules expressed on the T cells and infected or inflamed tissues. Recognition of specific antigen by the T cell receptor as well as ligand binding to other so-called “accessory” receptors can also stimulate lymphocyte activation leading to cell proliferation, lymphokine secretion and amplification of the immune response. Thus, a more thorough understanding of the ways in which lymphocytes communicate with their extracellular milieu is of profound importance to our knowledge of the workings of the cellular immune system. Moreover, such knowledge can potentially lead to the rational design of therapeutic interventions which could either amplify or dampen this response.  Over the past several years, my laboratory has focused on studying a T cell plasma membrane receptor which we discovered as a binding protein for pertussis toxin (PT). The exotoxin of Bordetella pertussis is a member of a group of bacterial toxins that are structurally composed of two functional subunits. The “A” subunit has enzymatic activity as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase which catalyzes the covalent modification of substrate proteins by the addition of an ADP-ribosyl moiety utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as the donor. The substrates for this reaction are GTP-binding “G" proteins which couple intracellular second messenger generating systems to membrane receptor signalling. PT is known to ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunits of a number of G proteins belonging to the Gi  class, including Gj and Gpa, as well as transducin in vertebrate photoreceptors. The “B” subunit of these toxins is thought to facilitate binding to the plasma membrane via specific receptor sites and to allow entry of the toxin into the intracellular compartment. In most cells, the effects of PT require a prolonged pre- incubation period with high doses of the toxin, suggesting that either entry of the toxin into the cell is slow and may be rate-limiting for the observed biological effects, or that higher intracellular concentrations of the toxin are required. In cell-free systems, treatment of the toxin with reducing agents is necessary to produce its enzymatic activity, presumably by reducing intrachain disulfide bonds.  In T lymphocytes PT stimulates cell activation, including the generation of second messengers such as diacylglycerol, increases in intracellular Ca2+, and tyrosine protein phosphorylation, resulting in cell proliferation. These effects of the toxin require only the B subunit, or "PTg" (1). The toxin receptor requires the co- expression of the CD3-T cell antigen receptor complex, suggesting that, like other so- called "accessory" mitogenic signalling receptors on T cells, the PTR stimulates cells by activating the T cell receptor (1). We have shown that the B subunit binds to a 43 kDa T cell plasma membrane protein, suggesting that this is the receptor that mediates the mitogenic effects of the toxin (2). It has been unclear whether the toxin receptor(s) is a novel protein or has been previously identified as something else. One possible, although unlikely, candidate that we considered was the CD38 antigen, a        40042818 __label__Scientific

Biswell  SUBJECT: KOOL MILDS 100: COMPETITIVE PRODUCT TEST RESULTS  The following provides results of Kool Milds 100's performance in the latest  SALEM Lights 100 competitive test. This competitive wave was to be the first test of a nationally manufactured improved SALEM Lights 100 product agaiast its new action standard competitor, Kool Milds 100. However, the SALEM Lights 100 product picked up for this test was rejected due to low tar. Therefore,  only ratings for Kool Milds are available since past competitive waves tested the previous SALEM Lights 100 product.  Results from Wave III, due in early November, will provide the next opportunity to confirm the competitive status of the new SALEM Lights 100 product.  OVERALL ACCEPTANCE  Kool Milds 100's overall acceptance ratings are extremely low among both competitive and franchise smokers.

You will find enclosed a copy of my advice to Pat, I am very interested in knowing what antiserum Chick Turner used for the CF test. We may need to use the anti-hamster leukemia virus serum for all our testing. Positive results would be very provocative.  I am now in the process of arranging my charter flight to California in November, I have obtained a ticket on a plane arriving in San Francisco about November 10,  I had one idea which may make our meeting more convenient fur you and at the same time enable me to visit NIH to get some supplies and finish up some paper writing there. Is it possible for CIR to pay my trip from San Francisco to New York ? I would leave the Monday after the conference (November 15). We could spend one or two days together and? then I'll go down to Washington, I can get a charter flight from New York to Paris very easily but must make a reservation very soon.  If you prefer meeting me in California, I shall reserve the return flight from there, Await your reply.  Looking forward to talking with you.  Have lots to share with you.  Best regards,  J/  Jay A.

B) How does our Best Prospects split with Competitive Emotional Core  We know we should only mail to best prospects, but have no idea how our competitive larget  may split - potentially - a large % could be Bad bets.  I will not be able to begin to project Question B until Inbound targeting is in place sometime in September.  But, the database was loaded with the results of third party Age verification last week, so | pulled a small analysis to see the results against Camel target.  As the attachment shows, overall about 60% are Age Verified in Non-restricted States. Given our smaller target Plan numbers in 1997, we could potentially only target Age verified smokers in Non-restricted states. This would of course be the best possible offer. We know via research and analysis that getting product in hand is key to improved Conversion results.  In addition to potentially consider mailing only where we can send gratis, there are other targeting strategies to consider. Another view would be to look at Camel priority Markets x Gratis Restrictions/Age Verification. Even though Couponing is not as efficient, and yiclds a lower overall % of Conversion, we may opt to concentrate only in strongholds Vs national. Now I've given you food for thought for two Non-national strategics.....  We have not considered either of these strategies, or any other Non-national stratcgics previously because of the mass quantitics of smokers we necded to put through  RJRO00000051 7013690  70048 5132  6Z6E esEecs __label__Email

TO: Bob Bexon Nick Brookes  John Jewell Mick McGraw - Carl Schoenbachler =P  CC: Walt Carpenter Mark Kovatch Baw  Frank Chong Rolf Provan Kay Culliton Rob Stowe John Heironimus Tom Wilson     FROM: Dan Haley  DATE: +; May 12, 1997  f / SUBJECT: _ Direct Mail Update  ae  OBJECTIVE  To communicate the range of activity and progress made through Direct Mail programs.  1997 ACTIVITY  Six programs were executed in the first quarter consisting of 4 single, priority-brand mailings and two multi-brand pieces. The three packages mailed in January and February (Carlton, Kool and Pall Mall/Tareyton/Viceroy) are redeeming at a higher than anticipated pace and produced a noticeable increase in awareness based on the U.S. Market Monitor. It is too early to comment on the March  mailings.  Second quarter mailings include Capri, Kool, Carlton Collection | and Lucky Strike (SF), as well as another non-priority mailing. All will focus on competitive smokers, while Carlton Collection {I will also target its franchise . Two additional offensive pieces have been added as part of the aggressive share growth plan. The first will be sent to past redeemers and will consist of nine brands, while the second targets prime full-revenue prospects and includes coupons for six brands.  Third and fourth quarter programs are strictly to drive volume, while continuing to identify misredeemers and single-brand redeemers. There are three programs aimed at past redeemers and one targeted at prime value-for-money prospects.  DATABASE  Continuous enhancements are being made to the database. B&W programs have added 1.4 million new redeemers since 41/95. Identification of past redeemers is critical to direct mail’s success as  these smokers tend to redeem new offers at significantly higher rates. Additionally, using LOGIT models, all database names have been ranked according to their propensity to redeem B&W brands based on demographics, past usage, income, etc.  Eliminating misredeemers is another key objective. It is anticipated the Kool “poison pill” program will eliminate over 40,000 misredeemers from the database. In the third quarter, a Savannah Lights “poison pill’ coupon will be sent to all past redeemers in order to identify additional misredeemers. As a result of continuous purchases, redemptions, purging and elimination of duplicate names the  database currently contains approximately 43.3 million adult smokers.  432302119 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Note

All smokings were performed under FTC conditions.. Solutions obtained at each sampling point containing a known amount of internal standard (quinoline) were examined via temperature programmed capillary gas chromatography using mass selective detection. Visual comparison of the resulting chromatograms showed the TM-6 sidestream to be considerably less complex than the 1R4F sidestream at every sampling point.  Quantitation of the resulting peaks (relative to the internal standard) showed that the TM-6 sidestream contains fewer components (96% less in the particulate phase and 82% less in the vapor phase) and less total material (97% less in the particulate phase and 84% less in the vapor phase) than the 1R4F sidestream.

GHATS  THE AOMOCATE  NEWARK. OH pe eee, 738  BT | i.  (9922.58  Gordon gladly trades bravery for maturity, more victories  NAZARETH, Pa. (AP) — Robby Gordon says he isn’t quite as brave as he used to be.  But don’t get the wrong idea. The change is simply a measure of the growing maturity of the 25- year-old Indy-car driver.  “| was a braver driver three years ago,” Gordon said Friday between practice sessions for Sunday's Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix at Nazareth Speed- way.  “T feel I’m a better driver today in taking calculated risks instead of just making instant decisions,” he said. “Most of all, though, I want to win races, When it comes to the last 20 laps, we’re going to just suck it up and go for it.”  | With two races remaining, Gor-  : don, in his second full season on  . the Indy-car circuit, is locked in a tight battle with Michael Andretti and Paul Tracy for third place in the season standings. .  Al Unser Jr., winner of eight of 14 races this season, already has locked up the season title and Emerson Fittipaldi is virtually as-  m  INDYCAR  sured of second place with 151 |  points.  _Going into today’s qualifying on the one-mile oval, Andretti, a former series champion, holds third place with 114 points, fol- lowed by Tracy with 169 and Gor- don with 104. Nigel Mansell, the defending serjes champion who will return to Formula One next season, is a longshot for third place with 83 points and a maxi- mum of 44 remaining.  Unser, Fittipaldi and Tracy are  teammates on the powerful Marl-  boro Team Penske, each driving ,  Ilmor-powered Penskes.  “If you can split the Penskes, you've 2 definitely done something with a Lola chassis this year, Gordon said. “And to be ahead of Mansell, who is using the same equipment, well, that tells you what a great job the guys on the Walker Racing team have done this year.’  Gordon feels so good about the way the team has developed this year that he has signed a two-year contract extension with an option year in 1997. y  ZSC182E80Z __label__News
INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  mw  To: ODr. G. R. DiMarco May 8, 1984 From: M. Stowe  Subject: R&D and PT&D Projects on Specially Processed Tobaccos  Drs. Bernasek, Dickerson, and I have discussed the type of R&D work which we feel should. be conducted as an extention of the MaD Project. We recommend that work be undertaken in  R&D to 1) confirm the effect of this type of tobacco processing on smoking characteristics, and 2) determine which process(es) RJR should develop. An outline of the project work and staffing which we recommend for 1984 is attached.  Since further evaluation of blends ‘depends on the availability of adequate quantities of the specially) processed tobaccos, an attempt was made in late April to produce cast reconstituted sheet at TMCI, Inc. The sample arrived in R&D on Monday. If the smoking characteristics of this material are judged to be acceptable (or close enough to lead us to believe acceptable material can be made at TMCTY), then the R&D program outlined on the attached document should be feasible for 1984. If this is not the case, the timetable will be lengthened cansiderably. ,  Recommended staffing for the R&D project is shown on the project outline. The appropriate Managers have been contacted to determine that temporary assignment of the staff indicated to this project is possible if you approve this commitment of R&D manpower. Because his time is heavily committed to work on TGA, Dr. Casey is not included in the project staffing. Dr. Dickerson had indicated that a limited amount of his time would be available for consultation, and I will ask Dr. Lloyd if such an arrangement will still be possible.  A major objective for PT&D in 1984 should be to establish facilities for the production of experimental quantities of cast reconstituted sheet. This along with the planned upgrading of the G7 Pilot Plant will put us in a position to conduct process research on either ‘or both of these types of - reconstituted sheet. Without such facilities, it will not be possible to conduct research of :any quality on the  type of treatments needed. A memorandum is attached which outlines the work which PT&D will conduct in support of this  project.  Please let me know when you would like to discuss this project.  . an UK ye He XC: Dr. E.

HKECO 16039 IV. ‘INITIATING VERSUS DEVELOPMENTAL INFLUENCES     General Comments  It is obviously difficult to separate influences on the initiation of cardiovascular diseases and tnose which affect the development of such diseases once they are established.  This is especially true where recognition and classification of the disease occur only after other symptoms exist, as is usually the case.  As might be expected, there is no hard and fast rule or universally consistent clinical opinion on this matter. It is clear that individuals differ in response to smoking and to their deprivation from the habit.  Further research may conceivably indicate that a sufficiently high percentage of those with established degrees of cardiovascular disorders will react so unfavorably to smoking as to justify medical advice on certain courses  of restrictive action. This, however, is properly a matter of relationship between the individual doctor and his patient. The desired situation is one  which will involve es broad and comprehensive knowledge as can possibly be acquired to guide the profession in the light of its clinical experience.  The references appended will present opinions which are based on such experience. They should be considered as being contributory rather than  conclusive and as being selected for purposes of comparison.  The important point is that more refined and sophisticated longitudinal studies of controlled populations of apparently normal individuals are sorely needed. These should aid in refining our recognition of departures from normalcy which represent the earliest evidence of the diseases under study and which, therefore, may be closely connected with their origin.  Similarly, manipulable populations of patients with established early cardiovascular diseases should provide material for more sophisticated clinical studies of factors which may influence the progress and course of  these diseases.  Until such studies are organized and bear fruit we shall have to be content with a type of evidence which leaves doubt as to whether we are dealing with factors which influence origin alone, progressive development  alone, or both.  Ocular, Cerebral and Other Peripheral Circulation  According to Bettman, Fellows, et al., the effect of cigarette smoking on intraocular blood volume in man is net known. ‘They have, therefore,  used animals for experimentation.  If the cigarette was smoked at the normal rate there was no effect. If it was smoked rapidly there was a significant rise in intraocular volume. Denicotinized cigarettes gave generally similar results. __label__Report
Author: Robert L. Oglesby June 26, 1979  Division: Process Development ‘ TDM, 1979, No.: 31 Number of Pages: 9 S FC R FT  Project No.: 2817 No. 20 By  TEST L-13,257 - WINSTON MENTHOL 100's WITH NWA FILTER.        OBJECTIVE:  Determine parameters necessary to place this brand into production with non-wrapped acetate (NWA) filters.  SUMMARY :  Various porosity tipping papers were used with the NWA filters on WINSTON Menthol 100 cigarettes in order to arrive at an air dilution system which equals the standard. TPM, smoke panel, and physical properties analysis indicate that a 70 second (470. Coresta P): electrostatic perforation achieves the desired results. Heat seal tipping (HST) is the preferred method of sealing the filter, although limited tests with an emulsion adhesive were also successful.  Another test, L-13,408 has been produced (and packed) in order to increase our confidence that 70 seconds ts the proper tipping porosity and to perform  a U. S. Mail Panel test to compare the NWA to our present cigarette. DISCUSSION:  Regular 68 mm. green line cork tipping was gravure coated with a diamond pattern (See Attachment 1) in the perforating area. Bobbins were then elec- trostatically perforated to approximately 50, 70, and 90, seconds (650, 470, and 350 Coresta P.). A chart of porostiy measurements and their percent standard deviations for both Gurley and Coresta P. is presented in attachments.  Test cigarettes were produced on May 24 in Factory #1-3, Mark 9/PA-8 machine #1. Machine start-up and the test run was without problem. No bad-wrap was encountered with the HST/NWA combination. One leg of the test involved using NWA filters and Sampson #EX-267/9 emulsion adhesive with the  skip-gap-gummer. The machine started and made enough sood cigarettes for test purposes, but the run was too short for a judgment of its mechanical performance.  Fe, cn anne ane mmm - .

Pls review carefully and provide feedback, we need to finalize this general outline and then move forward with implementation.  Clearly some of these iterns are long term efforts, but we need to provide tools to the RD's, and more importantly, a broad plan they can utilize in their own states in '99 and beyond.  Scott/Pam/Henry/Dan/Ted -- we need to pull a real plan together for each of the legislative orgs listed in the plan, and perhaps others. BUT, we must coordinate with YSP and follow their lead re: thoughts on how best they can support/complement our efforts. And there is the issue of over committing YSP and being streched too thin that we must always consider.  1 am happy to work with each of you along with KD, in pulling those plans together, with an emphasis on substantive policy results, not PR. As meetings are fast approaching, how does the end on  January sound for a deadline?  Josh/Tom/Chris -- what's the status of the state research, both state and fed dollars? Do we need to meet again re: the studies of states and their various approaches to the issue of youth smoking?  Chris -- you and I need to set a date and meet with the attys for a little legis. drafting, and as we discussed, we need to do that ASAP.

Sea THE SUN MEAS sc  MYRTLE SEACH.  CIRC -\H48. tS)45. 188  HEI NGPORER        25h     OOo  Leslie gets his first Grand National win  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  . CLERMONT, Ind. — Tracy Leslie, taking advantage of spins and wrecks that sidelined the frontrunners, beat David Green to the finish line by .73 seconds Satur- day night in winning the Kroger 200 NASCAR Grand National race at Indianapolis Raceway Park.  The victory was the first in 77  - Grand National starts for Leslie,  “T can’t say enough about the crew. They did it,” Leslie said. “We don’t know how many bumps (the Oldsmobile) has on it and now it's gt one on the roof’ from where  slie stood on it in victory circle.  “But we don’t care.”  Todd Bodine and Robert Pressley were fighting for the lead on lap 172 when they came up on the slower Buick of Troy Beebe. Pressley’s Chevrolet took the low side and Bodine’s Chevy the high, and ‘all three spun into the wail. Tommy Houston’s Ford, running third at the time, also became in- volved, as did the Chevys of Larry Pearson and Steve Grissom. A red flag was shown to stop the field while tracks crews cleaned up the mess.  No drivers were hurt.  Winston Cup veteran Terry Labonte rallied from three laps down to take third with Burton coming home fourth.  Polesitter Ernie Irvan was the fastest car on the track much of the night but his Chevy blew an engine on lap 151.     Mansell wins Marlboro  BROOKLYN, Mich. — Nigel Mansell ignored the bumpy track and shrugged off a raging headache to hold off teammate Mario Andretti_ and win Sunday's Marl-  boro 500 at Michigan International Speedway.  Mansell, running only the second 500-mile race of his career, domi- nated the 250-lap race on the 2- mile, high-banked oval and re- gained the IndyCar PPG Cup point lead from Emerson Fittipaldi, who struggled to a 13th-place finish on the hot, humid afternoon.  The Briton, who was the Formu- la One champion last season, took the lead from pole-winner Andretti on the 28th lap and led 2 of the last 221 Japs, including the final 167.  Mansell, who finished third to Fittipaldi in May in his first India- napolis 500, had more problems with the rough track and the heat on Sunday than he did with any other driver in the 23-car ficid.  “The circuit is just fantastic,” he said. “It stands alone, just like Indi- anapolis. P've never driven anything like it in my life and it’s beaten me. Tm glad there wasn’t another 10 laps Because I was hanging in there  just at the end and I don’t mind  telling the world I'm tired.”  Mensell crossed the finish line 9.434 seconds ahead of Andretti, with Arie Luyendyk of the Nether- lands, who was the Indy runnerup, a lap down in third and Boesel an- other lap back in fourth. __label__News

TOBACCO TECHNOLOGY GROUP INTER-OF FICE CORRESPONDENCE     RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Lee Pollak D November 19, 1987  ate:  John Vaughan;  SAFETY - PHILIPPINES  We have received an inquiry, copy attached, from Philip Morris Asia Region concerning the transmittal of safety information to the  La Suerte Licensee. The information to be furnished is the Material Safety Data Sheet for flammable and combustible materials which relate specifically to the casings and flavors supplied to La Suerte by  Philip Morris. A copy of the data sheets, as furnished by PM USA, is also attached. .  The Material Safety Data Sheets do not fully cover the safety aspect of the materials being handled and I suggest that La Suerte  also be provided PM USA's procedure "Safe Storage, Handling, Mixing, and Application of Ethyl Alcohol Based Flavorings", a copy of which is attached. If we are reluctant to issue a PM USA document to La  Suerte, perhaps the PM USA reference could be removed and the document provided as good safety practices.  aN I would appreciate your review of the attached information and  your advice.

Nucleic Acid Technologies Poundation  July 1, 1996 et nfal #6  George A. Hashim  Associate Research Director  The Council for Tobacco Research - USA, Inc. 900 Third Avenue Sept 4° New York, NY 10022     he  Dear Dr. Hashim:     Albany: New York, This will be the fifteenth i in the ¢ series of race Cente, oad Nt SHE  Nucleic Acid Technologies Foundation, in conjunction with several area academic and scientific institutions.  As you can see from the enclosed flyer for this year's meeting, the topic is a very timely one. There has been a burst of interest in recent years on mitochondrial involvement in normal cell function and in disease. Mitochondrial defects are being implicated in a host of neurological, muscular, and metabolic disorders (including diabetes). In addition, considerable interest is starting to focus on mitochondria as targets for a wide range of drugs, including benzodiazepines, immunosuppressants, channel blockers, and nucleoside analogs. Because of the renewed interest in this "old" organelle, the meeting is attracting a distinguished group of front-line researchers to present their latest work.  The reputation and visibility of the Albany Conference series have grown with each meeting over the past 11 years. However, as with all ventures of this type, we rely heavily on outside sponsors to help underwrite some of the expenses. Each year we have been fortunate to receive significant support from private organizations such as yours, who have a vested interest in promoting biomedical research.  The Albany Conferences are unique in many ways, including their intimate nature and inter- disciplinary focus. The audiences have been savvy and appreciative of the chance to exchange ideas in the environment we provide. We make every effort to let them know which companies have helped to make each meeting possible. ,  This is a request that you consider helping us make the 1996 Albany Conference on Frontiers of Mitochondrial Research a success with your sponsorship. We are seeking contributions in the range of $500 to $5,000. Higher level contributions carry perks such as single-room accommodations for scientific representatives (registration fee waived) and full-page sponsor acknowledgements in the meeting program (design of your choosing but no product advertising). Certainly, we would also be pleased to receive smaller contributions, all of which will be recognized at the meeting and in the final program.  70015348 __label__Letter

August 12, 1987 a.  f *  TO: TT. J. McCabe  RE: Marlboro Media Plan  Attached is an excellent compilation of Marlboro's 1986 media plan and key learning/conclusions relative to this formidable competitor's media strategies/tactics, The information was compiled and analyzed by Gabe Gabriel and is illustrated in a standard RJR plan deck format.  As Gabe concludes, Marlboro's media activity is extraordinarily broad and extensive - a mass media schedule befitting a dominant~share brand with appeal transcending focused demographic parameters.  Importantly, it appears the media schedule is not designed to address Marlboro's FUBYA strength but, rather, to maintain its ubiquitous  presence against total smokers, thereby defending its business against smokers likely to switch out of the franchise,  This strategy is similar to RJR's in that neither Marlboro nor RJR primarily concentrate efforts against franchise smokers. The key difference is the direction in which the brands view their opportunity segments, Marlboro's focus appears to be franchise maintenance as their smokers grow older in age. Conversely, RJR's focus is against younger adult smokers who may be brought into the franchise.  Opportunity = Convert Base Opportunity = Maintain Opportunity = vonvert — YPP y  Marlboro Franchise ———~—------> _ Older Adult Smokers Younger Adult ——-~—~--> RJR Brands Franchise Smokers  With your approval, next steps are to distribute Gabe's analysis to the CAMEL, WINSTON and MAGNA Brand Groups, as well as Media Planning, for their review and an enlightening look at the specific tactical activity behind Marlboro's known high spending levels.

January 10, 1995  SUMMARY  MEASURES OF PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO FDA REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS  Public Opinion Poll .  The majority of Americans favor the current level of regulation of cigarettes or even teducing it --- only a minority believe regulations should be expanded to include the FDA.  Opinions do not differ by gender, age, education or income level and no subgroup favors expanded regulation.  Petitions  More than one million adult Americans have signed petitions opposing FDA regulation of tobacco products.  Signatures from every state -and every Congrerssional district-- illustrate widespread opposition to the FDA regulation.  Letters  Thousands of Americans from all walks of life have written to FDA in recent months  opposing FDA regulation tobacco products,  A sampling of these letters show broad, nationwide opposition to the FDA proposal and a strongly held view that FDA action is unnecessary.  a = m oa eS o a n wo  tie einer nvennananninttiaetmes __label__Report

The scheduling was agreed to by the Brands as the earliest practical date for use of the Warning Statement in these media.  These timing instructions do not supersede the instructions you have received earlier giving you the final date of compliance, but they are intended to coordinate all brands' scheduling so that the Warning Statement will begin to appear about the same time in all our brand advertising.

We have localized the bulk of the S-adenosy methionine synthetase activity to the post-mitochondrial supernatant. We show that in all cell lines @ single kinetic species exists in a dialyzed extract with a X,,, for methionine of about 3-12 uM. In selected  lines we have demonstrated a requirement for Mg?* complex for enzyme activity and have shown that th inhibition.

Introduction  Almost all higher animals require dietary methionine for growth, although this need can generally be met by its metabolic precursor homo- cysieine in the form of homocystine (1). A similar situauion has been found for Primary cultures of normal mammahan cells where either methionine or a mixture including homocysteine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid is required for growth. However, in virally transformed or in cancer cell lines, cells often lose the ability to proliferate in methionine- deficient, homocysteine-containing medium (Met '-Hcy*) and become dependent upon methi- onine for growth (for a review, see Ref. 2).

It has been clearly shown that methionine-de- pendent cells synthesize targe amounts of intracel- lular methionine from homocysteine and 5- methyl-tetrahydrofolate (3,4). Methionine is used not only for protein synthesis but for the ATP-de- pendent synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine. This Product is used as a methyl group donor in a wide variety of transmethylation reactions. as a pro- pylamine donor in polyamine synthesis, and as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine [5,6].

SPECIAL CIGARETTES FOR MARKETING DEPARTMENT  I. Brothers Filter  a. Mold Modifications  The design of the Brothers Filter has been modified on both the exterior and interior of the filter.  The exterior of the filter has been modified in order to improve performance of the filter on the filter making machine and to obtain a design which would be different from the outside of the Parliament mouthpiece. The original structure of the serrated Brothers Filter was such that when cigarettes were made the serrated plug meshed with the roll drum on the making machine and resulted in creasing of the  tipping. Three approaches have been tried to eliminate this:  (1) The section of the roll drum under the filter was filled to give a smooth surface. The creasing effect was eliminated but tipping was wrinkled in spots.  (2) The number of serrations was reduced from 18 to 10 in order to avoid meshing. This eliminated creasing and this type filter will be evaluated more extensively on the making machine.  (3) The outside structure has been designed to give a diamond shaped pattern. A sam- ple of these filters has been shipped and will be tested this: week.     £988 6L7Z0S __label__Report
“  ‘14 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, : Tuesday, Dec. 13, 1977     —-  j Asbestos workers would get $20 million, including $5.7 million in an un- usual payment by the federal govern- ment, in a secret settlement of consoli- dated suits by the Tyler, Texas, work: ers. They had charged negligence that permitted exposure to cancer-causing asbestos.  ’ (Story on Page 14) * 2 *     ‘U.S. Reportedly Agrees in Asbestos Suit.  To Pay Portion of $20 Million Settlement        A WALL STREET JOURNAL News Roundup In an unusual move, the federa! govern-  ment has agreed to chip in $5.7 million as  part of a §20 million secret settlement of consolidated suits by 445 Tyler, Texas, as- bestos workers.  Despite a gag order by U.S. district court an all parties involved, Informed sources say that the workers, who sued the federal poverni.:cut and several private companies in 1974, were secretly offered a cash settle- ment in September. The sults allege public and private negligence that allowed workers to be exposed innocently to cancer-causing asbestos, specifically a type called amosite. The settlement, whicn allows conclusion of the suits without specific blame being placed with anyone, was sealed until at least Thursdav.  The Tyler workers sued the companies that owned the plant since its opening in 1% until it closed in 1972 as well as asbes- tos suppliers. The defendants include Pitts- burgh Corning Corp., a company jointly owned by PPG Industries Inc. and Corning Glass Works that operated the Tyler plant from 1962 until 1972. These three companies will pay workers about $8.1 million, sources said.  Other defendants include Union Asbestos     ’  -~——- —________._,| the plant came from federal stockp     eee & Rubber Co., of Chicago, which will pay $1 million. The British holding company of Cape Industries Ltd. and its subsidiaries were also sued and will pay $.2 million.  owns asbestos mining and marketing con- cerns in Africa, London, and the U.8., sources  said. . The federal government's share of the  settlement totals $5.7 million. The payout was arrived at as the result of charges of withholding bealth information on workplace conditions.  Specifically, federal authorities were charged with entering into a secret agree- ment with the plant's management to with- hold from workers findings of high asbestos levels in the air. Sources said that the agreement was entered into by the Public Health Service, which thought it wouldn’t otherwise be allowed right of entry to in- spect the workplace in 1964 as part of a sur- vey of 38 plants. However, another charge against the government was that eg the Flant was operating under federal contract it fell within the realm of the Walsh-Healy Act, which requires the government to en- sure that workers for @ federal contractor have a safe workplace. The plant made as- bestos insulation to supply Navy veseels.  Sources sald that some asbestos used at Jes in unmarked sacks. Sources said that federal officials made depositions that admit to the Government Services Administration’s sale of unmarked asbestos up to two years ago, and said GSA still sells asbestos, although it is properly labeled.  The suits were brought after Tyler work- ers became concerned about unhealthy work conditions. Sources said that 25 deaths have been directly attributed to the workplace conditions, and that about 70 to 80 asbesto- sis, or lung disease, cases have been docu- mented over the last few years. Also, un-  ‘| usually high numbers of a rare lung cancer  called mesothelioma has continued to show up among former plant workers,  PPG Industries declined comment on the proposed settlement end other defendants weren't available for comment.  Although he declined comment on whether a settlement had been reached, one attorney for numerous plaintiffs said that the case's outcome ‘won't be of preceden- ttal value elsewhere... it doesn’t mean the government will necessarily be held liable anywhere else.”’  85650285 __label__News

RJR MEDIA  Position Paper No. 8 Subject: Translating National Media : Programs of Cigarette Products  Into Test Market Situations. .  ‘  Background - The Corporation is presently committed to test marketing several new cigarette brands. Given the uniqueness of each brand's marketing strategy, it would not be feasible to formulate a media translation procedure encompassing all possible test situations. However, a general course of action is evident which may be applied to most test market translations.  In scope, the following will set down a general media policy for test market concepts, market selection, and the mechanics of media:  Discussion ~ Test Market Concepts  - There are two test market concepts which MRD may use in reading the |  S  results of a market test--"National Simulation" or "Division Simulation."  The following is a discussion of these two concepts and the implications which they have for developing a media translation:  National Simulation ("Little U.S." Translation) - In this situation, each test division serves as a model for the total U.S. marketing  area, Ideally, there are three test divisions, each with a population  of 500M+. In addition, the configuration of each division in terms  of metro, rural, and ethnic population, sales distribution, and media penetration should closely resemble that of the national market as  a whole. Obviously, it is doubtful that any test*division will exactly conform to both the U.S. population profile and the coverage provided by a national media plan; usually, the selected division represents the best compromise under the circumstances.  In addition to MRD's criteria for selecting a division for test  (BDI, category development, etc.), these media and demographic factors should be considered: ,  1) Metro population: % division vs. % total U.S.  2) Rural population (C & D counties): % division vs. % total U.S.  3) Ethnic population (Black and/or Spanish): 8% division vs. % total U.S.  4) National magazine penetration in the division vs. total \ U.S. average. NOTE: The county-by-county circulation of the magazines should be determined to acknowledge geographic circulation variances.  L809 0200S __label__Report

Street  New York, New York 10022  Dear Dr. Lisanti:  { am wttting to you concerning the feasibility study of d=Nicotine and gamma~pyridy1-J-oxobutyric acid CPOBA), Some problems have arisen concerning the aviailability of some chemicals that ‘we need to complete the study and we would Tike to ask to extend the study through July Ist. We have found that racemization occurs at the elevated temperature (250°C) and pressure as indicated in our previous report. [t fs now clear that the yield obtained by this approach is very Jow and would be of the order of &-5% which makes the method impractical for preparing larze amounts of d-Nicotine. We are there- fore evaluating lower temperature (e.g. 170°C). The chemical synthesis of racemic nicotine looks promising and may be the best solutton. How- ever, until the backordered chemicals arrive we will not be able to complete the study. [t appears that we have liquidated the world's supply of cyclopropylbromide!!  We have investigated the McKennis synthesis method of POBA and are not at all happy with the procedure or the yield. As an alternative we are looking at the reaction of 3-pyridylmagnestumbromide with succinic anhydride as a possible one-step synthesis. Results of these studies will be discussed tn our next report.

DiMarco  Weekly Highlights - Biochemical/Biobehavioral For Week of June 17-21, 1985  ITEMS FOR WEEKLY BRIEF:  Biobehavioral Research  Human Smoking Behavior - Tests of the human mimic smoking  machine with data "corrected" mathematically to adjust for mechanical distortions have shown improvement in machine per- formance. Visual examination of puff shapes indicate that good replication can be achieved. Goodness of fit of repli- cated flow rate profiles to actual human profiles has improved by 50% over the data obtained from the previous cor- rection method. Replicated puff volumes and durations are within 3 to 5% of desired values. The major step to be com- pleted prior to beginning smoke regeneration work is the installation of the mathematical correction procedure on the HP-1000 computer system.  A two-liter syringe required for accurate calibration of the Respitrace inhalation monitor was modified by the machine shop to provide a demountable, leak tight seal to the spirometer. Modifications to software used to control the inhalation monitor have been made which enable th syn- chronization of data acquisition from both breaths (by means of the Respitrace) and puffs (by means of the HP-1000 puff- profiling system). Once modification of the puff-profile software to provide for triggering of the Respitrace is com- pleted, data from both breaths and puffs can be acquired Simultaneously.  b97T TOTTS __label__Letter

CAMEL EQUITY STUDY (#350-60) ANALYSIS MEETING (6/20/94)  1. Attitude Segmentation:  The objective is to identify the attitudes that embody the spirit of young adult smokers.  * The segmentation is based on the responses to a battery of 55 attributes on attitudes toward life.  * Initial results indicate two distinct groups that reflect a CAMEL attitude.  * The first group is highly sociable and is characterized by the following attitudes:  Want to live in/near a big city.  Prefer a party to a quiet night at home. Too wild to settle down.  Having fun is extremely important. Prefer an exciting adventurous life. Important to keep up with new styles. Fitting in with friends is important.     oeee #8 @ @  Camel occasional usage is highest among this group.  * The other group is slightly more detached, as the following attributes suggest:  Work is not important.  I don’t always think things through first.  Not important to keep up with new styles.  Not worth paying extras for well-known brands. Fitting in with friends is not important. People should be free to look, act and dress the way they want.  This segment contains a high proportion of white males in their late 20’s and early thirties. It has the highest proportion of Camel UB smokers, and is the second highest on occasional usage.  * The largest segment include the conventional, work- oriented, settled-down smokers who prefer a quiet, secure life.  * The final group is the smallest, and has the most & pessimistic attitude.

or  PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  ‘to: «Dr. W. F. Gannon pate: Februany 22, 1978 From: “K. S. Burns . '  “. Subject: .Nitrate Reduction in BL  A meeting was held at R&D on February. 10 to review the status of various process development programs related to the above subject and to try to firm up: our future plans in this area. Those: in. attendance were:  H. G. Burnley’ C. R. Hayward K. S. Burns D. J. Keliton  W. A. Farone N. R. Rowe  W. F. Gannon W. R. Wilkinson  G. Gellatly  After: extensive discussion on a number of relevant subjects, the following course of action was agreed upon: . 1. Manufacturing Engineering will sample and characterize the various effluent. streams from the BL. Plant containing significant levels  of nitrate: and determine which streams must be treated (by some presently ‘ undefined method) to meet future EPA’ specifications.  : 2. In.one initial trial, Dr. Farone and his. staff have shown that reduction of the nitrate in the BL effluent by a microbiological process is feasible. Under the current. schedule, they. would expect to have a pilot. plant for this process. operating in about 12 months. Optimization studies using the specific effluents to be treated! could! require another 3-6 months after the Pilot plant is operational.  3. After reviewing the burley stem pressing process that R&D has 4 proposed to replace the current washing/drying operation, it. was decided that Yes - a better assessment of the potentiall energy savings from such a process was necessary. Manufacturing Engineering: agreed to carry out sucha study.  They: (Manufacturing Engineering) also agreed to determine if ” adequate space was available at the BL Plant to install the: pressing: system  Wher ‘ parallel to: the present equipment. This was considered desirable: since this  process is difficult to pilot completely.  4. If the findings in #3 are favorable, R&D will conduct a series n of trials using the Reneburg presses in the RL Pilot Plant. to. determine. if . the many different types. of stems processedi at the BL Plant can be dewatened ph to a reasonably constant average OV. (The presses recommended by R&D are made by Bauer Company and are more of a precision made piece of equipment that should give: less moisture variation than the Reneburg. Unfortunately, however, Bauer does not have a pilot unit that we can buy or rent.)  hwore else has perthire?  ta __label__Memo

KNOXVILLE 2, TENNESOEE  November 1, 1967  American Tobacco Company | 245 Park Avenue New York New York 10017  Attention: Mr. Robert B. Walker. Chairman of the Board  Gentlemen:  I doubt if this letter will get to the Chairman of the Board, but anyway, I am a stockholder in the American Tobacco Company and received your communication of October 25th, and I frankly think the tobacco industry is hiding behind a log. As  . long as Kennedys can keep this as a whipping boy, they will: con-  tinue to do so, and of course, it is purely for their personal  . gain and not the public.  I have wondered why the tobacco industry has not asked the Government why not label whiskey as dangerous to your health, paregoric which can be bought at any drug fountain in small quan- tities, and many other household items such as aspirin, etc. I have wondered why the tobacco industry did not get the producers association and different farm organizations busy on this, because  it is not going to end until someone makes it politically unprofit-—  able for the food and drug administration and Kennedys to make an issue of it.  I have practiced law since 1933, have had a lot of deal- ings with the medical profession, and how in the Hell ¢hey can say that tobacco causes cancer, when they do not know what cencer is, is beyond me, but at any rate, it is a popular subject. I remember twenty years ago, when 1f a person had a bellyache he was automatic- ally operated on for appendicitis, and that fad has blown over with the medical profession. Also the tonsillectomy for all children has blown over. I well remember when the nedical profession sa that Blue Cross would destroy the nation, and now they are the - greatest believer in it, and it has enhanced their earnings.

Vol. 14, No. 1, 1964 BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS  . 1 NUCLEAR RIBOSOMES, AN EARLY FACTOR IN TISSUE HKEPARATION  Se Gudbjexnason and C. De Schryver Department of Medicine  Wayne State University College of Medicine and Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan  Receaved October 16, 1963  The role of cytoplasmic ribosomes in protein synthesis has been studied extensively in the past; more recent discoveries suggest (NolLA et al, 1963) that the functional units or protein synthesis are ribosomal aggregates, "ergosomes", consisting of particles held together by m-RNA. The origin of cytoplasmic ribosomes is a matter of some speculation but a current favorite is thet ribosomal RNA is synthesized in the nucleus.  The purpose of our report is to present some data which indicate that nuclear ribosomes are labeled earlier than cytoplasmic microsomes during tissue reparation, suggesting nuclear origin of the cytoplasmic microsomes. The studies were carried out on subcellular fractions of infarcted and normal cardiac muscle.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Myocardial infarction was produced in dogs by ligation of  branches of the anterior descending coronary artery, so that a homo~- geneous infarct was obtained. Glycine-2-cl4 (specific activity 15.1 mc/mMol) was injected  intravenously, 30 gic per kg body weight. The animals were sacrificed     2 this work was supported by Grant No. H-5043 from the U.S. Public Health Service, The American Heart Association, The Michigan Heart Association, Life Insurance Medical Research Fund, Tobacco Industry  Research Committee, The Burroughs-welicome Fund, and The John A.» Hartford Foundation.  12  PUBLICATIONS 004251 __label__Scientific

McKenzic  Definition of Terms     Draft is the resistance to the flow of air. A standard flow rate is used to measure the resistance which is recorded in either inches or milli- “meters (mm) of water. The higher the resistance, the higher the number of the measurement.     Firmness is a measure of the softness of a cigarette tobacco rod. The measurement is made by applying a standard force for a standard period of time to the tobacco rod and measuring the depression in 0.) mm. increments. Therefore, 0.1 mm. of depression is called 1.0 units of firmness. The higher the firmness. number, the softer the cigarette.  Smoke Analyses are obtained by placing the cigarette in a special holder, lighting the tobacco rod and pulling air (35 ml) for two seconds once per minute. This constitutes a "puff". The cigarette is puffed as specified above until the fire cone or burning zone reaches a line 3 mm.  - from the filter tipping.  “Puff Count is the average number of puffs required for all of the cigarettes in the analytical procedure to reach the specified 3 mm. distance from  the tipping paper.  Nicotine is the pharmacologically active alkaloid ingredient in tobacco smoke, and is collected on a special filter during the smoking procedure. The nicotine is reported separately from other smoke components.  Tar is all the solid and liquid materials in smoke except nicotine, which is reported separately, and water, which is subtracted, to obtain weight of tar per cigarette. oo  pH is a measure of the acid to base ratio. A value below 7 is acid and a value above 7 is basic. °  Implications of Measurements Upon Consumer Perception  Draft: Typical cigarette draft is about 2.4 to 4.5 inches. Too low a draft would make it difficult for the smoker to pull air through the fire cone _ and generate smoke. Too high a cigarette draft would make the smoker have difficulty pulling the smoke through the rod, e@.g. the Strickman , filter. __label__Letter

&  : : ang, Washingtor s +, February 6, 1960 tees ee an Lo ot _. - 8 Congress to Be Scene of BatHa . - ’  “* Seripps-Howord Statt weitac  The-law, which will expire on June 3 unless  ., te Lo renewed by Congress, was included in the act »- A proposed government ban on cigaret adver-  tising on television and radio has. drawn the lines:  _ for a major congressional battle between pro- and  " anti-tobacco. forces, but the possibility arose to- day that the controversy will end in a compro- mise that’ will limit — but not end — such smok- ing commercials. uo “t :  ‘- “The battle, which was fought to a draw four “years ago, was kicked off yesterday when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) vot- ed 6 to 1 to propose a rule forbidding eigaret ads ~ on TV and radio. ms  The FCC's action followed a speech Friday by Sen. Frank E. Moss, _ cigaret: advertising, who warned he would filibus- ter if necessary to prevent renewal of a 1985 law which forbids federal agencies or the: states to “ban. cigaret ads. oo We uo:  we ne ee =     at ele.  ae cat  D.,, Utah, an ardent. foe of’     One said:  that required a warning on cigarel packages that smoking may be a hazard to health. Sen. Moss, who backed the legislation. when it was enacted, . Pointed out that it had prevented the FCC:from. placing any. restrictions on cigareticommercials,  "Tf the law-is permitted to die and if court action by the cigaret producers does not overturn the Proposed FCC rule, TV networks stand to lose more than 25 per cent of their national Spot ad- vertising. The marketing structure of the tobacco  " industry also will be threatened with convulsive  changes. In. 1967 — the last year for which figures are available — cigaret' commercials brought $226.7 million in revenue to: TV networks and $17.5 million to radio outlets. :  FCC: Chairman Rosel. H. Hyde said yester- day that smoking posed “a most serious, unique danger to public health.” He cited' Health, Educa- tion and Welfare (Hew) department statistics showing there are 50,000.deaths a year from lung  . cancer, 25,000 deaths from: emphysemia and ~ chronic bronchitis, and claiming that one.in three - of all deaths of men between 35.and 60 is related , fo cigaret smoking.  COMPROMISES EYED One element of'a possible compromise was con-  “- tained in the FCC proposal, which suggested an ~ ’ @xamination of whether: cigarets low in tar and  nicotine should be exempted from the TV-radio “advertising ban. :  “Some congressional sources. said they believed  -&@ Compromise would have to be broader in scope.-  “For the first time the legislative monkey is on  ‘the tobacco industry's back. The ban on.action to  regulate cigaret advertising will be dead June 1) unless Congress extends it, and that means that for the first time the anti-cigaret forces don't have. to do anything.  “The tobacco state Senators and Congressmen will have to infroduce a bill and: try to get. it passed. A compromise is possible, but it is oing: to have to offer a genuine, substantial reduction: in TV and radio cigaret| commercials. A. token: gesture by the cigaret companies simply: isn't going to work.” -  ; ‘Altho TV and radio networks presumably would     be heavy losers if the FCC Proposal is adopted, industry sources Said this would not necessarily be the case. Advertising Age, an-industry journal, said in New, York networks would not be affected to any major extent. A spokesman: noted that tobacco commercials generally. appear in prima “ “ radio-TV time and that other advertisers would be quick to move in if these choice spots were vacated, ee ‘A Tobacco. Institute spokesman said the FCC proposal. “Is an obvious thréat to usurp the con- .8ressional function.” _ , _ At his: press conference, however, FCC Chair. man Hyde said one purpose of the proposed rule was to alert Congress, and that Congress would  nee  _ have to be the “final arbiter” of the dispute.  The Tobacco Institute spokesman saidia scien-~ : tist associated with “more research in tobacco. and heaith than any other person” said that no “causal relationship between smoking and any disease” had been demonstrated,  DISPUTE HEALTH CHARGE. _ a  “T€ anything,” the tobacco industry spokesman quoted the scientist, “the pure biological evidence is pointing away from, not toward, the causal hypothesis.” The scientist. was identified as Dr. Clarence Cook Little, scientific director of tha Council: for Tobacco Research USA.”  Sen. Moss is expected to have strong support in the Senate Commerce Committee for his move ta let the present. law expire and thus clear the way for the FCC ban. Chairman Warren G. Magnuson, D-Wash. is expected to back Sen. Moss. as is Sea. John. O.. Pastore, D-R.L, chairman of the subcom- mittee to which the issue will be referred.  In the House, pro-tobacco forces seem to be ia a somewhat stronger position.  Rep, Tim'Lee Carter, R-KY., a member ofthe House Commerce Committee, said: “I feel'some- thing will be done (to keep the law alive). So many things are hazardous — 26,000 of 50,09) drivers killed each year were driving while drunk. Why not ban TV advertisements for beer and wine? A group of us will introduce a bilt conlinuing the present law. We don't want te destroy. the livelihood of thousands in Kentueky and North Carolina who depend on tobacco for a living,”” . :  eas  + ee ee ah  00625137 __label__News

SMOKING MACHINE CONTROL PROGRAM NOTES  The current version of the 7317 exposure contro! program was written to contro! two Geneva smoking machines which have been modified to allow the computer to disable thelr cigarette loader and unloader functions. The program controls by momentarily enabling one of the load/unioad functions when that function Is required and must “remember” the age and location of each cigarette throughout the exposure to ensure that spent cigarettes are replaced at the proper time. The product smoking machine has two igniters that are controlled by the computer In addition to the loader and unloader, the reference smoking machine has none. The computer also times the duration of each exposure, automatically records CO monitor readings, and controls filter and Impactor samples. A realtime aerosol monitor was recently added to the exposure system and a subroutine may be written to record these readings also.  The control program has been written as a series of subroutines that fall into one of the following three categories - EXPOSURE CONTROL, FUNCTION CONTROL, or SUPPORT. Following Is a brief description of the subroutines.  EXPOSURE CONTROL SUBROUTINES:  SUBROUTINE PARM | Loads required parameters fromthe data tables Into memory. | |  SUBROUTINE LABL Allows the operator to enter Information Into the program belore the inklatlon of an exposure. The  information may inchide which machine will be loaded with product and which with reference, the exposure concentration, or #f ether machine will not be used during an exposure cycle. The computer will record this Information In the exposure summation or will “ignore* a machine that was not used for exposure.  SUBROUTINE LODE | Loads the carousel following a prescribed pattern and maintains the carousel by replacing cigarettes after they have puffed the required number of times. The computer leaves LODE when a “start exposure"  signal is recelved and transfers control to subroutine EXPS. LODE functions through the following “Function Control Subroutines" * EJCA which controls machine #1 elector  * JCA which controls machine #1 Injector  * TCHA which controls machine #1 torch #1 and t's assoclated auxilliary puff port  * TCHB which controls machine #1 torch #2 :  + EJCB which controls machine #2 ejector  « [JCB which contro! machine #2 injector  SUBROUTINE EXPS  Continues to maintain the carousels by using the same subroutines used by LODE but also turns smoke to the animals, takes measurements, and controls various samplers that are required during an exposure. At the end of the prescribed exposure period exposure stops and the carousel unloads. Contro! then transfers to subroutine SUMA. EXPS uses the following contro! subjoutines In addition to those listed under LODE: |  * SPLR which controls the samplers « COMO which records CO monitor readings  * ARAM will record aerosol monitor readings if we decide to add It.  SUBROUTINE SUMA / |  Sums information and data from each exposure and prints a summation table. The program then resets | |  | | i i | ' |  itself and walts for the next exposure cycle to bagin.  w oS uw oo w o oo “I Nw __label__Report

MEMORANDUM March 26, 1984 ees NOs Katie Curren FROM: Scott Benson v PE: TRUE, LASER PORTFOLIO: TEST (NEWS) - TOPLINE REPORT  MRD #5542/484  _BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE  At Lorillard" s request, the agency prepared. three print spreads for True: Laser. These ads differed from previous ones in that more: emphasis was placed on product copy.  The purpose of this: research was to determine each ad's stopping power, persuasive ability and communicative content.  M:;THOD:     This study required four* separate cells of two hundred smokers. Each ad was exposed through the standard 20-ada portfolio. Eiigible respondents were random smokers, 18-64 years of age. Quotas were established so that half were malle and half female. Interviews were conducted in the following ten markets: Akron, Baton Rouge, Detroit, Fresno, Hicksville, Indianapolis, Middletown, Phoenix, Tampa and Washington.  * The sole purpose of the fourth cell was to determine the level of incorrect brand noting (specifically Merit) caused by the “Newsprint" ad. To get a clean read, a Vantage ad was substituted for the Merit control. This was an abbreviated cell in that diagnostic information was not required.           ANALYTICAL NOTE  Unless indicated, information presented in this report originated from the first three cells of data which utilized the standard portfolio and full questionnaire. The fourth cell of data only included the incorrect brand noting levels as this was its primary purpose.  - 04242498 __label__Memo

Lillian,  TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  January 20, 1993 TO: M. S. Ireland FROM: A. Prakash  SUBJECT: Analysis of Phenols in an Experimental Cigarette Sample Made With Brown Wrapping Paper and Compared to the Reference Cigarette, 1725-89 (PROJECT B 451 CMP)  Phenols in the mainstream smoke of 85 mm straight cigarette sample, submitted by J. H. Bell, were quantitated by HPLC (1). The sample cigarettes were made of brown wrapping paper. An earlier memorandum (2) on phenol results for the brown paper cigarettes is invalid since the sample was incorrectly identi-  fied.  Three cigarettes per pad were smoked by a single port smoking machine in J. H. Bell’s laboratory. The Cambridge pad containing the particulates of the mainstream smoke was extracted with 20 mil of isopropanol from the smoking laboratory. The isopropanol extract was diluted with equal volume of 6% aqueous acetic acid and analyzed for phenols. Results of the analyses are presented in Tables I and II.  A review of the results based on wet tar suggested lower hydro- quinone levels in the brown paper cigarettes compared to the reference, 1725-89. The results of the brown paper cigarettes were not consistent as seen from the relative standard deviations being greater than 25%, whereas the control showed a relative standard deviation 4-7%.  t C NA de foo Le  A.

Levy Place  New York, New York 10029  Summary  A system is described that allows use of recombinant DNA technology to modify the genome of Influenza vi- Tus, a negative-strand RNA virus, and to engineer vec- tors for the expression of foreign genes. Recombinant RNA is expressed from plasmid DNA in which the cod- ing sequence of the influenza A virus NS gene is replaced with that of the chloramphenicol acetyltrans- ferase gene. When transfected with purified influenza A virus polymerase protelns—In the presence of helper virus—the recombinant RNA is amplified, expressed, and packaged into virus particles, which can be pas- saged several times. The data indicate that the 22 5’ terminal and the 26 3‘ terminal bases of the influenza A virus RNA are sufficient to provide the signals for RNA transcription, RNA replication, and packaging of RNA into infiuenza virus particles.  Introduction  Influenza A virus is a negative-strand RNA virus that con- tains eight different genome segments (Palese, 1977). These RNAs, together with the PB1, PB2, PA, and NP pro- teins of the virus, make up the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core, which exhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the virus (Krug, 1983). Because earlier attempts to solubilize the polymerase were unsuccessful, it has only recently become possible to study the sequence re- quirements for the influenza virus polymerase. Szewezyk et al. (1988) were able to purify the three P proteins and the NP protein from acrylamide gels and renature the complex along with naked RNA using thioredoxin. In addi- tion, Honda et al. (1988) and Parvin et al. (1989) suc- ceeded in isolating active polymerase complexes from ri- bonucleoprotein cores using CsCl-glycerol gradient centrifugation. In the latter study, the purified PB1, PB2, PA, and NP protein complex (depleted of viral RNA) was then used to study the promoter signals for the polymer- ase activity (Parvin et al., 1989). Short synthetic RNA moi- ecules 30-53 nucleotides (nt) in length were transcribed from appropriate plasmid constructs by T7 RNA polymer- ase. The resulting RNAs contained, at their ends, se-  * On leave of absence from: Department of Meastes Virus, National In- stitute of Health, Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 190-12, Japan. t Present address: Department of Biology and Center for Cancer Re- search, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massa- chusetts 02139.  quences corresponding to the 5’ and 3’ terminal nucleo- tides of influenza virus RNAs. These RNAs were able to be used as templates for the isolated influenza virus poly- merase complex.  This ability to reconstitute RNPs in vitro allowed us to establish that the 3’ terminal nucleotides of an influenza virus RNA contain the polymerase recognition and pro- moter sites for transcription. However, the polymerase, pu- tified from whole virus, was not able to efficiently copy positive-sense template (Parvin et al., 1989). In addition, it had previously been demonstrated that the genomic RNAs in purified influenza virus and in infected cells formed circles via panhandle structures involving the 3’ and 5' terminal nucleotides (Hsu et al., 1987; Honda et al., 1988}. We thus speculated that the untranslated regions of an influenza virus RNA might be required to obtain effi- cient replication in vivo and possibly allow for the packag- ing of the RNAs into virus particles.  In this paper we discuss in vivo experiments using a recombinant RNA molecule containing sequences corre- sponding to the untranslated 3’ and 5‘ terminal sequences of the NS RNA of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 flanking the antisense-oriented open reading frame of the chloram- phenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. This RNA was mixed with purified influenza virus polymerase complex and transfected into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), 293, or Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Follow- ing infection with influenza AAWSN/33 virus, CAT activity was detected in the RNP-transfected cells, indicating am- plification and expression of the gene. In addition, the recombinant influenza virus gene was packaged into virus particles, since CAT activity was demonstrated in cells fol- lowing infection with the recombinant virus preparation. Virus containing the recombinant gene could be pas- saged several times in cells.  Results  Synthesis of IVACAT1 Template RNA  To study the transcription and replication signals of in- fluenza A virus RNAs in vivo, we constructed plasmid pIVACATt (Figure 1), which directs the synthesis of an NS RNA-like transcript. This RNA shares the 22 5’ terminal and the 26 3’ terminal nucleotides with the NS RNA of in- fluenza A/PR/8/34 virus and contains — instead of the cod- ing sequences for the NS1 and NS2 proteins— sequences encoding a full-length CAT protein. For cloning purposes it also contains an additional 8 nt including a Bglll site be- tween the stop codon of the CAT gene and the stretch of U's in the 5’ noncoding region. The T7 promoter adjacent to the 5’ noncoding sequences and the Hgal site down- stream of the 3’ end allow for the exact tailoring of the 5° and 3’ ends. Run-off transcription using T7 polymerase generates a 716 nt long RNA: lanes 2-4 in Figure 2 show that the IVACAT1 RNA is of discrate length and shorter than the 890 nt long marker NS RNA synthesized by T7 polymerase transcription of pHgaNS (lane 1). __label__Scientific

Myracie WA. / pls Subject:  PROJECT BOLD  BOLD 100’s cigarettes were produced with low, target, and high RTD filters to determine the effect of filter RTD on total RTD and subjectives. A +13 mm TRID at equal ventilation resulted in comparable products. Filter acceptance criteria were determined using this information and submitted to Filtrona. Four pallets of BOLD 100’s filter rods were subsequently requested for use in a factory trial to confirm these results and to investigate variability effects on manufacturing performance. These are scheduled to be completed by  June 7.  Results of the product placement test conducted in Northern Virginia/Maryland indicate that BOLD is rated more favorably than Carlton/Now on several liking-related scales. When compared to the 1990 study, the current white- tipped BOLD was rated as smoother, less harsh and less irritating than the previous BOLD model. - -  BOLD 100 POL’s 0594 and remakes of 0592 and 0593 were completed and released for testing.  LOW SIDESTREAM PROGRAM Superslims Single Wrap: Sidestream visibility measurements were made  for single wrap and double wrap POL test models. Compared to Marlboro Lights 100, each model gave approximately 70% reduction on the 8-port instrument. Conversion to the single wrap is expected at the end of May.  Fillers): Plans have been formulated for the preparation of preliminary magnesite cigarette models in different configurations to provide baseline  data for further cigarette development. The models will be made with the 7 magnesite paper (45 g/m, ternary) which gives highest SS visibility  reduction on a typical Lotus-type cigarette and the magnesite paper (55 g/m, binary) which gives preferred subjectives.  Cigarettes were made with magnesite papers from Ecusta at higher citrate levels than previous samples. The two 45 g/m ternary base sheet models gave about 70% reductions in sidestream visibility compared to Marlboro Lights; two 55 g/m binary models with slightly different base porosities and one 45 g/m binary base sheet model gave 50-60% reductions. The ash flaking on the ternary papers was considered excessive.  L9G6GLLG0G __label__Memo

During the week of June 3rd each cigarette manufacturing center will produce "Standard" Marlboro Long Size and King Size cigarettes. The exception to normal production is that each cigarette manufacturing center will use material from the same lots of "Standard Product" as supplied by our Processing Plants. Prior to June 3, 1985, each of our Processing Plants will produce the required amounts of "Standard Product" to be used for Marlboro production.  Analytical evaluation of these cigarette will be conducted by R&D. ;  To support the subjective evaluations, an 0/C Marlboro Panel was organized in February, 1985.

RR, inter-office Memorandum  Date: juty 27, 1972  Subject:  To:     Work Proposal  Dr. A. H. Laurene From: pp, Charles RIx  OBJECT: To study means of flavoring TC devices to further augment the taste of very low tar (less than 10 mg) cigarettes.  New TC devices have many advantages, the most obvious of which  is lessened tar delivery. The alr dilution causes smaller amounts of mainstream smoke to reach the consumer. Present TC cigarettes have deslrable flavor. However, If tar levels were to continue to drop lower, perhaps to less than  10 mg/cigarette, lessened flavor might result. It Is thts possible reduction  in taste which makes the successful addition of flavorants to plastic TC devices  desirable.  INTRODUCTION:  It ts suggested that a study of flavor transfer from TC devices be initiated. The flavorant would of necessity be held In a solid matrix, either on an adsorbent granule or in a permeable solid. The project would ascertain  the delivery properties of mode! compounds such as menthol, nicotine or flavorants to the mainstream smoke. It would require the services of one B.S. chemist for approximately 6 months. No new capital expenditures for equipment  would be required.  PROPOSAL:  Xe: Dr. D. H. Piehl Ny Dr. M. E.

Heflin  RE: WINSTON Packaging Focus Group  This forwards for your review the Brand's perspective on the WINSTON packaging focus groups held in Tampa on May 11 and 12,  Background  The objective of the groups was to evaluate franchise and competitive smokers' perceptions of pack designs developed for Project Eagle. Focus groups had been held previously (March 25, 26) in Atlanta to identify ownable elements of the current packaging that could be leveraged or refined, With this direction, KNT Plusmark developed new packaging designs for WINSTON. It was a selection of these refined designs that were tested in Tampa. The information from these latest groups will be utilized by Brand to provide further developmental direction in the development of a design for quantitative testing and test market introduction in 1/88,  Methodology  Two franchise and three competitive focus groups were held:  @ Male WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old e Female WINSTON smokers, 35 - 49 years old  e Female Marlboro smokers, 21 ~- 34 years old @ Male Marlboro smokers, 21 ~ 27 years old e@ Male Marlboro smokers, 28 ~ 34 years old  Current packs were evaluated against five new concepts. Four of the new designs were very close to current packaging, while one "further out" design was shown to see how large a change was acceptable. One set of packs had identical designs in the Full Flavor, except a black vs. a red logo. Another set of packs had the same design in the Full Flavor, except one was current WINSTON red while the other was a Marlboro red.  Implications e Change is acceptable to the franchise. Overall the franchise  groups reacted very favorably to the new designs. In fact, more radical change than would seem prudent was viewed positively by the franchise groups. The bottom line seems to be that WINSTON's franchise is essentially apathetic to their packaging. As aptly expressed by one participant: "WINSTON would still be WINSTON to me even if they wrapped them in a brown paper bag." The major concern expressed by the franchise was market recognition: they want to be able to quickly recognize and pick up their WINSTONS,  S088 6Izo0s __label__Letter

Authors: Fred W. Best Steve Sink  ~  Notebook Pages: 391933-391950 Dated: August 18,1988  FATE OF 14C-LABELED PHENETHYL ISOVALERATE IN TOTAL SMOKE FROM WINSTON KS CIGARETTES  OBJECTIVES:  An objective of this study was to determine the fate, including transfer efficiencies, of phenethyl] jsovalerate in total smoke from WINSTON KS (WKS) cigarettes. A further objective was to determine the distribution of phenethyl isovalerate  between tobacco rod and filter as a function of time prior to smoking.  SUMMARY:  Radiotracer studies with carbon-14 labeled phenethyl] isovalerate have been performed and show that phenethyl] isovalerate applied to tobacco rods (WKS) migrates to the filters. After 8 weeks the ratio was 35% in the filters and 65% in the rods. After 9 weeks this filter/rod ratio was 36/64 which indicated a leveling off in the migration rate. Therefore, smoking runs were begun. When smoked in the total recovery smoking apparatus ("TRSA"), 14% (88% of which was intact phenethyl isovalerate) of the total phenethyl isovalerate in the cigarette transfered to MSTPM and 25% (95% of which was intact phenethyl isovalerate) to SSTPM. Elution studies showed that only a net 10% of the phenethyl isovalerate in the filters (about 3.5% of the total in the cigarette) was delivered to MSTPM which represents 26% of the total in MSTPM. About 5% was eluted from the tobacco rods to mainstream smoke, 55% of which was removed by the filters. The unsmoked filters from the rod elution study were analysed and indicated a 40/60 phenethy] isovalerate filter/rod distribution at 10 weeks. Therefore, additional sacrifices were performed at 11 and 13 weeks and filter/rod . distributions of 45/55 were found at each time indicating another leveling in the migration rate. Data from the filtration studies indicate a 52/48 filter/rod ratio after 16-17 weeks. Equilibration may not have been reached when this study ended; however, the amount of phenethyl] isovalerate in MSTPM was constant regardless of the distribution prior to smoking. The filtration efficiency of WINSTON KS filters for phenethyl isovalerate was 44% at standard puffing conditions.  STATUS:  This work is complete. Results have been reported to the Flavor Division of Product & Applied Technology. No further work is planned.  S¢72 1OL0S __label__Report

~o RF | we Fe AEN ot CONFIDENTIAL wae  CrAr { woe Gor LL LY January 30, ipo2 CAN oo. CH L St (~ TO: Mr. £. J. Fackelman FROM: W. R. Penick  SUBJECT: MARC INBOUND 800# COST REDUCTION IMPACT  MARC’s toll-free cost reduction will impact two of our operational areas: Smoker Recruitment and Product Research. Savings in the 1991 Product Research projects would have totaled $180,000 with MARC’s new toll-free cost. This represents an 8% reduction in their total fieldwork costs. For the smoker recruitment area, the savings are negligible as MARC’s new rate is slightly lower than what we were paying in 1991; and the use of the toll-free operation  has been increased significantly with changes in our recruitment document design.  Coincidentally, but unrelated to MARC’s inbound cost reduction, Tracker is  reducing the cost we were paying for the diary panel recruitment tag-on. This cost reduction will provide a $235m cost avoidance in 1992 and is explained below.  . $46m was spent with TRACKER in ‘91 for diary panel recruitment. On a cost/complete basis, this cost was more than what we paid  MARC for smoker recruiting through SRMS. When questioned about this discrepancy, MARC attributed this cost difference to the  different markups each group in MARC used. MARC has standardized this markup, and the price was reduced to $23m.  . Instead of reducing the cost of Tracker by $23m, we asked TRACKER to use this money to recruit as many smokers as possible due to the low cost/complete with the new price. This has resulted in doubling the number of smokers recruited.  . We also made a procedural change in how these smokers are used. Instead of putting these smokers directly into the diary panel, the smokers will now be placed in the SRMS and allocated where they can provide the greatest benefit. For example, an 18-24 year old Marlboro smoker to a CAMEL product test. This will allow us  to maximize savings for the company ($235m estimated in 1992) through the most efficient allocation of resources.  If you have any further questions, please call.  “traO  W. R.

PROJECT TITLE: Project Tomorrow CON F{ 0 EN I AL  PROJECT LEADER:  R. W. Dwyer PERIOD COVERED: November, 1991  I. THERMAL PROPERTIES OF CIGARETTE  A.  B.  Objective: Relate the design of cigarettes to their thermal properties.  Results; The heat loss of freely smoldering cigarettes has been measured with acalorimeter. Additionally, the heat loss of cigarettes smoldering on fabric/foam substrates has also been measured. Cigarettes smoldering on substrates lose weight at about 85% of their rate during free burn. The cellulose-based fabric used in these experiments.has a heat of smoldering combustion comparable to the cigarettes themselves. The dimensions of the cigarette coals were unchanged by placing them on the substrate, contrary to NIST’s observation. The power output of the freely smoldering cigarettes appears'to be a linear function of the MBR, while. the heat flux appears to be independent of MBR.  Further, experiments show that substrates affect cigarette MBRs at separation distances of up to 4.5 mm, suggesting that the.disruption of the boundary layer may be an important factor in-extinguishments  We have.also monitored the out flow of gases from cigarettes smoldering in free air and on fabric/foam substrates.. We see the flow rates cycling about a mean flow--this behavior may be related to. temperatures cycling in the cigarettes.  Plans: We plan to measure the heat flux of freely smoldering cigarettes and  cigarettes smoldering on fabric/foam substrates as functions of air flow. This should allow us to determine heat flux as a function of flow rate in order to  explain the role of flow on fabric ignitions.  ezoszz0z02e __label__Scientific

Rubin Barney & Birger  THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  March 13, 1996     In Courtrooms, the Debate  May Never Be the Same  By MiLo Geyeun And Ricuarp B. Scumirr Staff Reporters of Tur Wau. Srancr JOURNAL  Liggeit Group’s tentative settlement of a giant class-action suit against the to- bacco industry could alter the dynamics of tobacco litigation forever.  Plaintiffs would receive only a meager sum for smoking-cessation programs, but some legal experts predict the settlement will set a benchmark for the industry’s legal liability and may help potential ju- rors get used to the idea that tobacco companies should pay damages.  Moreover, lawyers for the plaintiffs anticipate more immediate benefits in the class-action suit, known as Castano and brought on behalf of every U.S. smoker who claims to be addicted. The industry is set to argue next month before a federal appeals court in New Orleans that the case is too big and unmanageable to proceed as a class action. The Liggett settlement, say plaintiffs lawyers, will help them deflect that argument by showing that the issues can be resolved through negotiations.  “The principal objection is that this case is so large and complex that it’s not manageable. This settlement will show that it not only is manageable but that we've managed it,” says Richard Hei- mann of the San Francisco firm Lieff, Cabraser & Heimann.  That argument will become even more compelling if Bennett LeBow, who controls Liggett parent Brooke Group Ltd., suc- ceeds in his bid to merge Liggett with the nation’s second-largest tobacco company, the Reynolds Tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Corp. If that happens, Mr. LeBow’s settie- ment would extend to the combined entity, which would have a 27% market share.  The 44-page settlement, which requires court approval, also includes a number of provisions that could further divide the tobacco companies and give plaintiffs a leg up in the fact-finding phase of the litiga- tion. Chief among them is a provision requiring Liggett to disclose “any fraudu- lent or illegal conduct” by any tobacco company that results in the suppression of evidence or otherwise is “designed to frustrate or. defeat” plaintiffs.  “We're not going tosee any more of this stonewalling and hiding documents,” said Russ M. Herman of Herman, Herman, Katz & Cotiar in New Orleans. “If they've got them, we're going to get them.”  Some people say the pizintiffs lawyers gave up too much to get those concessions. Under the settlement’s terms, Mr. LeBow could cancel the deal and terminate pay- ments at any time if he decides too many smokers have rejected the terms and opted out. Mr. LeBow couid also walk away if his former co-defendants score a court-  room victory.  At the very least, the settlement would enable Mr. LeBow to slash Liggett’s $10- million-a-year bill for defending itself in tobacco lawsuits. At current profit levels, Liggett would pay ne more than $2 million a year for 25 years under the settlement.  it “seems like a sweetheart deal’ for Liggett, says Larry Schonbrun, an Oak- land, Calif., lawyer who is often critical of class actions.  Some other tobacco litigants also criti- cize the deal as a giveaway. ‘‘The settle- ment is just an embarrassment,” says Miami plaintiffs lawyer Stanley Rosenb- latt, who has a statewide class-action suit against the tobacco industry pending in Florida. Liggett’s lawyers believe that the Castano settlement will supersede Mr. Ro- senblatt’s claims against the company.  Still unclear is whether Liggett can persuade enough states to.join a separate settlement to resolve another slew of law- suits seeking compensation for the cost to taxpayers of providing health care to  ECOSSELTO] __label__News

I hope that you still are interested in exploring the possibility of a cooperative effort to reduce underage smoking in Washington State through the application of a  combination of our RIGHT DECISIONS/RIGHT NOW and SUPPORT THE LAW programs,  Further, during our December 5th meeting we discussed the JOE CAMEL advertising for our CAMEL brand. You were not surprised when I indicated that, at that time, we were not prepared to discontinue all use of our present campaign; however I take this opportunity to reaffirm what I did tell you during that meeting. Even though we are confident that CAMEL advertising does not cause anyone to begin smoking, if you believe that there are specific actions which we could take in  order to have a real impact on underage smoking, we are prepared to discuss your suggestions in good faith.  I look forward to hearing from you on either or both of these subjects,     GMB/df  T@69 OBTTS __label__Letter

ponte tat  B626 H176£ P Sas wean JJ AM J TNC MED  American Journal of Industrial Medicine 11:539-561 (1987) ) Ctr Acknowledged W. D. denkins  Changes in Smoking Characteristics by Type of Employment From 1970 to 1979/80 [cre “yor,  James J. Weinkam, osc, and Theodor D. Sterling, PhD     Changes in the distribution of smoking status between and within occupations by sex, race, and age are examined for 1970 and 1979/80, 10 years that saw rapid changes in smoking prevalence. The pattern of occupation within smoking categories remains basically unchanged, and, in fact, becomes more pronounced among males. The proba- bility of young people taking up smoking remains tied to eventual occupational choice. The decline in smoking prevalence is larger among the employed than among those who  are not employed. There has been a substantial increase in refusals to answer questions about smoking.  Key words: occupation, smoking prevalence, smoking decline     INTRODUCTION  There have been a number of reports on prevalence of smoking by occupation, based largely on data collected prior ta 1971 [Sterling and Weinkam, 1976, 1978; Covey and Wynder, 1981; Blair et al, 1985]. However, profound changes have taken place since then that may have affected both the mix of occupations and the prevalence of smoking of the U.S. population. Widespread introduction of new technology may have operated to lessen the importance of certain service jobs and to increase technical, professional, and clerical employment. These same factors may also have contributed to a shift in racial differences in occupation. Housewives have entered or reentered the labor force in increasing numbers. At the same time, there appears to have been an overall decline in the prevalence of smoking.  Changes in smoking prevalence oyer time raise a number of questions of importance to occupational health investigations:  1. Have ‘here been changes in the occupational differences in smoking prevalence?  2. Have there been changes in the distribution of occupations within various smoking categories?  3. Are such changes similar for females and males, for blacks and whites?  School of Computing Science, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.

OSHA  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), of the United States Department of Labor, has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on indoor air qualitiy (IAQ) and tobacco smoke. It would impose broad requirements on employers regarding air quality and the operation and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It would effectively prohibit smoking in indoor public places. ‘  Smoking would be banned in restaurants, bars, private clubs, retail establishments, office buildings, government buildings, bingo parlors, bowling alleys, casinos, hotels and motels, sports arenas, and every other indoor space except residences. It is the most far-reaching proposed smoking restriction in history, and would override every less restrictive state and local restriction currently on the books.  It would apply to EVERY workplace, regardless of size, with the exception of sole proprietorships (one self-employed person, with no employees) .  The only “concession" to the reality that 45 million adult Americans smoke is a provision for smoking areas which is so burdensome they are unlikely to be provided by more than a handful of employers, if any. Smoking could legally take place only in ‘separate, designated pon-work areas, which are maintained (ventilated) at a negative pressure compared to surrounding areas and separately exhausted to the outside. Further, no employees  could enter the area for work purposes.  In other words, they could go into the designated area for a “break," and smoke a cigarette, but not to work. Thus, a restaurant or bar could not have a smoking room in which food or drinks were served, or from which dirty dishes or glasses were removed by workers. Even routine cleaning of the designated area/room would have to be done during hours in which no smoking were taking place.  In other words, if this rule is allowed to take effect, there will no longer be a single bar or restaurant anywhere in America (with the possible exceptions of Indian reservations, the United Nations, and foreign embassies and consulates) in which you can be served food or drink while smoking a cigarette (or pipe, cigar, whatever).  ezeg Loses __label__Report
€     For some time, the Research Department has been concerned that the G &R Data is not an effective tool for improving Lorillard's advertising. There ‘appear to be 2 reasons for this problem: - 1) the data does not have the con- sistency necessary for clear direction, and 2). the data js just not being used.  Accordingly, we are recommending the discontinuance of the G & R service as of September 1. We will be investigating alternative methods of measuring the effectiveness of our advertising during the coming months. Due to the terms of our contract with G & R, their service will ‘continue through the end of the year.  If you feel that we should continue to subscribe to the G&R service,  please let me know before the end of August.  LD/gds |  cc:  . Cotrone  . Flinn  . Giordano . Goyette  . Lancaster . Mau  .

PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  To: To All Philip Morris Employees cate: August 23, 1996 FRM: Geoffrey C. Bible  SUBECT: FDA Regulation of Tobacco Products  Today President Clinton announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued regulations governing tobacco products, with the stated purpose of reducing underage tobacco use. As you know, we firmly believe that kids shouldn't smoke, and we're leading the industry in preventing underage access to cigarettes.  On May 15, we proposed federal legislation that would make it impossible for anyone to legally obtain tobacco products in the U.S. without a face-to-face transaction where age can be verified. We believe a legislative approach, which President Clinton has said he would prefer, would take us a long way toward the goal we all share: a marketplace where kids cannot buy cigarettes. We hope Congress will take up this issue soon.  The FDA's plan is wrong-headed. It's illegal. And we're going to fight it with everything we've got. The agency claims it must seize control over cigarette advertising, promotion and sales to prevent underage smoking. And FDA Commissioner Kessler says that once his agency takes control of the tobacco industry, it could ban cigarettes.  This Pandora's box of regulation flies in the face of the law, the facts, history, common sense and public opinion. In our corner we have the U.S. Constitution, recent decisions by the Supreme Court, Congressional history and past statements by FDA commissioners. What's more, the vast majority of Americans take our side on the central issues, including the right of adults to make their own choices about whether to smoke and our right to market  |  our products to adults.  Our blueprint for legislation contains many of the same elements the FDA has proposed. But under our plan, the FDA will be expressly forbidden  £osZeveloz __label__Memo

INGLEWOOD NEWS Inglewood, California January 18, 1957  % We Believe  WHERE THERE'S SMOKE...  If you watch television with any de- gree of regularity. it may seem evident to you that salesmanship is responsible for the report that at the end of 1956, the filter-tin variety has captured nearly one- third of the American cigaret market.  On the other hand, science, fear or superstition may have had equally as much todo with this change in the Amer- can cigaret smoker's habits.  Thirteen billion more cigarets were smoked during 1956 in spite of increasing reports linking smoking with lung can- cer. From this, it may be deduced that while the catchy jingles and dramatiza- tions that are presentcd over TV may have had a great deal to do with filter-tip cigaret sales’ increase, the compelling de- sire of smokers to put something between themselves and the possible harmful ef- fects of tobacco cannot be discounted.  So the scare lingers on, -while a prob- ably fictitious faith is being placed in the wide variety of filters on cigarets.  Cigaret companies for many years sought a mild tobacco. Growers sought to supply this demand by carefully breed- ing plants that would turn out a tobacco leaf low in nicotine.  Now the rush seems to be toward the filtered variety of cigarets, so jn order to get some flavor through to the smoker, stronger tobaccos are preferred. The practice has been for the best tebaccos to go into standard cigarets, while the harsher blends are put in front of the filters. Therefore. the flight to filter-tips may in reality be a rush to the kind of tobacco that does the most damage to health.  No one has yet proved conclusively that there is any harmful effect from smoking. but the new trend, induced by the possibilty of such dangers, is causing nothing but confusion to tobacco farmers and plant breeders.  The most confused people in the whole situation, however, may be those smokers who, to reduce their fears about the peril, if any, from smoking are putting them- elves behind filters but by no means cut of all possible harm's wav.  pay Kansas crty sur’!

Other Forms of Air Pollution Probably Holp Boost Riso in Lung Casas,     Specific laboratory proof that cigaretre smoking causes cancer of the lungs has not been adduced, but five experts conducting a pulmonary dis- ease clinic at the University of Kansas Medical Center to- day agreed that clinical rec- ords indicate a relationship between heavy smoking and such cancers,  However, added the experts, smoking likely is only one of several air pollutions in city life today ihat may be boost- ing the remarkable rise in lung cancers. The other pol: lutions:  Motor car exhausts, especi- ally from use of high-octane gasolines.  Fumes Pervade Air.  Coal fire fumes, more heavy in European than American cities, from home and factory chimneys.  Fuel oil and oil refinery fumes from homes or fac- tories.  Heavy use of macadams and tars for road surfacing.  The experts polled here are Dr. Jobn McClement of Colum- bia university, Dr. Hurley Motley of the University of Southern California. Dr. How- ard Van. Orstrand of the Cleveland clinic, Dr. Julius Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Martin FitePatrick, head of the lung disease section of the K. U. center.  The five also agreed cancer is not the only lung affliction which may be inc!ted by smok- ing and other pollutants. These aggravants often are factors in bronchitis (inflam- mation of the bronchial tubes). which, when chronic, may bring on emphysema, a dis- erder in the lungs’ ability to oxpel air.

Copyright © 1982 by the American Chemical Society and reprinted by permission of the copyright owner:  Kinetics of Transfer of Pyrene and  rac--Oleyl-2-[4-(3-pyrenyl)butanoyl]glycerol between Human Plasma  Lipoproteinst  Steven C, Charltont and Louis C. Smith*  ABSTRACT: Control of lipid transfer between plasma lipo- proteins has been studied with pyrene and a pyrene-containing diglyceride analogue, rac-1-oleyl-2-[4-(3-pyrenyl)butanoyl]- glycerol. The rate constants for transfer of the fluorescent probes between high-density lipoproteins in dilute solutions containing ions of the Hofmeister series are correlated with the molal surface tension increments produced by this lyotropic series. Moreover, the rates of transfer correlate well with the aqueous solubilities of the hydrophobic compounds, which were increased in dilute solutions containing organic solvents. The rates of transfer are faster with an increase in the distribution coefficients of the probes between the lipoprotein donor and the aqueous phase, suggesting that the rate-determining process can be considered simply as a partitioning between two im- miscible solvents. Rate constants for transfer of pyrene be- tween high-density, low-density, and very low density lipo- proteins depend on the ratio of the donor/acceptor lipoprotein  Pasma lipoproteins function as circulating reservoirs for a  wide variety of hydrophobic substances that have extremely low solubility in aqueous solutions (Smith et al., 1978; Scanu et al., 1979). These compounds include triglyceride, chole- sterol, cholesteryl ester, and phosphatidylcholine as major components and minor amounts of lipid-soluble vitamins and  . environmentally derived contaminants.  The relatively constant compositions of the circulating li- poproteins result from five simultaneous processes: (1) syn- thesis and secretion, (2) passive transfer and exchange of lipid     From the Division of Atherosclerosis and Lipoprotein Research, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine and The Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030.

In addition, the rate of transfer is in- versely related to the lipoprotein radius, with a linear corre- lation observed between the log of the rate constant and 1/ radius, By analogy with the evaporation of liquid droplets described by Kelvin’s law, the transfer of a lipid from a li- poprotein or a membrane surface can be described as kyave"**/" where X is a constant, w is the interfacial surface pressure of a curved surface of a radius 7, and kg is the dissociation constant. These results show that the rate of transfer of lipids can be modified by changes in the solubility of the transferring species in the aqueous phase and imply that other factors, such as solubility of the transferring species in the membrane and the properties of the lipid-protein surface, may have important roles in regulating the kinetics of lipid transfer in biological systems.  and apoprotein components, (3) active transfer involving specific plasma exchange proteins, (4) enzymatic changes in composition involving lecithin—cholesterol acyltransferase and lipoprotein lipase, and (5) removal from circulation by celfular uptake of lipid and apoprotein components. The dynamics and the contribution of each process to overall lipoprotein me- tabolism are poorly defined.  All lipoproteins contain proteins, cholesterol, and phos- pholipids in a surface film that surrounds a neutral lipid core of cholesteryl ester and trigiyceride (Shen et al., 1977). Li- poprotein surfaces have the dynamic properties of a two-di- mensional fluid, in which there are rapid noncovalent inter- actions between individual lipid and protein components, in- volving both rotational motion and transiationai diffusion in the surface (Lee, 1975; Thompson & Huang, 1978). Because the lipid components of lipoproteins are soluble in the aqueous solution to some extent, they also partition between the lipo- protein surface and the aqueous solution (Charlton et al., 1976, 1978}. Since some lipoprotein components transfer on time scales (milliseconds to hours) that are much shorter than the  50244030  i __label__Scientific

Terry Sanford told the annual con- vention of the National Asso- ciation of Tobacco Distrib- Ulers at the Fontainebleau Hotel.  “This report Is by no means astisfactory to doctors and sclentists, either in ite consideration of ques- tions concerning tobacco usé or its contribution to the scientific unierstanding of the diseases to which it ade dresges Itself," Sanford sald.  Sanford, governor of the nation’s chief tubacco-produc- ing and processing state, said, “I don't in any way discredit the report to the Surgeon General.  “But when I am asked if it doesn't pin down the condem- nation to tobacco, once and for all, my answer Is emphat- ically, that it does not”  Sanford suggested “two Constructive courses of ac- tion.”  CONTINUED study of tobacco and smoke to identi- fy or eliminate the suspected health risks.

Terry San- ford made a prediction Monday of “new levels of growth and prosperity” for the tobacco in- dustry “once it is freed from the clouds of health considerations" by research into the cause of cancer and heart disease  Addressing the National As- sociation of Tobacco Distribu- tors, Sanford said the gavera- ment report on smoking “raised & lot of questions but didn’t find the answers."  Sanford, gevernor of a state that produces two-thirds of the nation’s tohucco, challenged the basis on which he said “exces- sively deduated regulators”  were seeking to take tobacco away {rom ils users,  “What.” he asked, “would satisfy the ological needs ef the 70 million Amercans who smoked in 1963, if they were suddenly deprived of tabacco?”  Antismoking campaigns of today, he said. are being waged “prumarily with statistical cor relations of one kind or an- other."  Declaring that the govern: Ment report “doesn't pin down the condemnation of tobacco,” he proposed a continuing study af tobacco “lo identify anil eliminate the suspecled health risks," and a more intensive Bludy of cancer and heart ail ments.  Sanford said that since 1900 the annual death rate from ma- jor luag ailments has fallen by 84 per cent, during a period which cigarette smoking was on the merense.  Sarford hit at what he called fneon-'stencies in the recent re- port af the U.S. surgeon general linkirs cigarette smoking and lune cancer.  “| dn ant in any way discredit the revert fo the surgeon gen- ea." said Sanford. “But when loam asked if it doesnt pin @ovn hs condemnation of to- ba‘co, once and for all, my €ns ver 15, emphatically, that it does not”  Sanford called attention to statistical surveys nut used by  the advisory committee and cit- ed the incadence of tung cancer in non-smokers.

The brand is being tested at full margin in Bakersfield and at generic prices in Shreveport. According to sources in the wholesale trade, Full Priced Misty Slims will expand its test to the state of California and to Atlanta, Georgia in December, 1989. e Misty Slims’ share remained at 0.4 in Shreveport (Generic Priced) and increased one~tenth in Bakersfield (Full Priced) to 1.0, from the previous period. Similar to when last reported, the share difference between the two markets appears to be due to the higher levels of promotional support in Bakersfield, where 81% _ of stores have at least one Misty Slims promotion versus 20% in Shreveport. * Bakersfield’s incentives include B1GIF’s, $3 off carton purchase, free eye make-up with carton purchase and free magazine (up to $3 value) with carton purchase. The pantyhose with carton purchase and B1G1F’s continue to be reported in Shreveport’s outlets. In addition, only one store offered the free magazine with carton promotion in the generic priced market. e For the past two months, Shreveport’s distribution has remained relatively constant at 64%. However, distribution has increased +6% to 73% in Bakersfield.

ON BRONCHIAL CARCINOMA (no by W. Donk  During the last years there have been many papere on lung cancer. It is therefore,  unnecessary to review here consequently this very timely disease, In the following, we shall discuss a few aspects of the total problem and report a few observations .  which we have been able to make with the many patients of our Clinic.  There seems to be no question that the absolute number of bronchial carcinomata bes increased, This can be further proved by a few figures,  Gesell reports from Switzerland that the total mortality from cancer has almost doubled (1.8:1) from 1904 to 1948, while the mortality from lung canser has in- creased in the same period 20.7 times. In the United States in 1920, 1.1% of ail deaths due to cancer were due to a bronchial carcinoma, while in 1948 the figure was already 8.3%,  The figures for the population of the city of Vienna have been put at our dis- posal by the Central Statistical Office of the city, Total deaths due to cancer have increased from 1931 to 1938 (2) city districts) 15.3%, and from 1939 to 1951 (26 city districts), they have increased by 16.7%. The deaths from carcinoma of the respiratory system in men were 15.8% of all cancer deaths in 1991, 20.6% in 1938, and 31.76% in 1952.  For men and women together, the peroentage of deaths from cancer of the respira- tory system as a percentage of the total mortality from cancer was 6.66% in 1931, 11.92% in 1938, and 17.9% in 1951, The total mortality of the population of the City of Vienna due to cancer has increased by one sixth during the last twenty years; the mortality from cancer of the respiratory system has doubled,  In 1934, 440 people died per each 100,000 inhabitants of the City of Vienna due to cancer of the respiratory system; for 1939, the figure was 584, and for 1951, 1,014. These figures likewise prove that there was a mch greater increase in deaths due to lung cancer when referred to the total mortality due t. cancer,  These conclusions, however, are somewhat limited by the fact that the mortality statistics do not give as clear a picture as @ morbidity statistic, which does not exist in Austria. It is certain that presently a greater number of other carcinomata than those of the lung are cured, and those naturally are not in- cluded in a mortality statistic for cancer, This arguement against the mortality etatietios nevertheless, does not alter the fact of the absolute increase, How- ever, wo shall not discuss theses theories in detail, Here we shall disouss only the effects of cigarette smoking on bronchia)] carcinoma, since these relations ay a great timeliness.

The overall aim of this research project is to find a suitable biochemical marker(s), which appropriately reflects the integrity and metabolic function of the epithelial cell lining layer of the respiratory tract, yet is sensitive enough to detect subtle cellular dysfunction before irreversible change or malignant cell transformation occur. Central to this search is the inhalant injury produced by cigarette smoke cn the airway lining cells. The object is to identify a marker substance which will discriminate for young smokers at high risk to develop lung diseases, or will select the person who is likely to develop a primary lung cancer. To this end,, they have been examining levels of free secretory component (FSC) in  “.. lung secretions. FSC is a unique glycoprotein, synthesized and secreted by the     “ epithelial lining cells of the airways and its production reflects their protein metabolic capability. Subjects have included young healtly cigarette smokers and  ‘& nonsmokers and patients with a lung mass, considered to be a primary neoplasm.            Progress. a  (1) FSC in normal volunteers. Pinal analyses of FSC and other protein and cellular components in lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) have =: ' been completed in 56 subjects (32 smokers and 24 nonsmokers). ‘These results are in press (American Review of Respiratory Diseases}. ‘To summarize the results, a subset (20%) of young smokers have very low  levels of FSC in their airways. They may be at high or abnormal . visk for the development of lung disease.     (2) FSC in lung cancer patients. To date, 93 patients | have been studied with BAL fluid analysis. FSC values are very low in patients with |-. squamous cell.carcinama. It appears as if the integrity of secretory IgA is also impaired in the airways of these subjects, possibly a reflecting an inadequate supply of FSC which is essential for coupling to the dimeric IgA molecule. : 5     Future Plans.

Amy -~ here are a few thoughts. If you would like more, I can do it. We are keeping very quiet about the Ewing stuff. That’s why I made only a veiled reference to it.  The General Accounting Office is continuing its investigations of the FDA’s actions that led up to its proposed tobacco regulation. The two investigations focus on the use of appropriated money -- were funds redirected from congressionally mandated functions? -- and the internal process FDA used to come up with the regulations. FDA continues to stonewall legitimate congressional requests for information, and faces the possibility of  additional actions.  ASSIST -- I would not add anything about it.

CHARGE NUMBER : 2306  PROGRAM TITLE : Flavor Transfer PERIOD COVERED: February 3 - 28, 1975 WRITTEN BY : R. M. Ikeda  DATE OF REPORT: March 3, 1975  I. Smoke Flavor Studies?  Six of the important volatile odor constituents of TPM were measured for the diluted 8 mg and the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes. These compounds were added to the diluted 8 mg cigarette to raise their deliveries to the levels of the all-strip non-filtered cigarettes.  Subjective evaluations are being carried out on these fortified 8 mg cigarettes.  II. Flavor Transfer?  Procedures for the analysis of the hydrocarbons in filler and smoke have been established for the study of the transfer of these compounds from filler to smoke. There are losses of the added Ci0-Cis hydrocarbons in this procedure. Investigations are underway to determine  where these losses are occurring.  III. Hydrocarbon Markers?  Saturated hydrocarbons (Ci5-Ci7) were added to aftercut solution and sprayed on fillers of various brands of cigarettes. These hydro- carbons are applied at 20 ppm and can be easily detected and used to identify various aftercut solutions applied to filler.  Iv. Sugar Replacement*  A study has been started to determine if dextrin can be sub- stituted for sucrose in the burley spray. Dextrin has been substituted for sucrose at 25, 50, 75 and 100% levels. Initially all burley  cigarettes will be made and tested subjectively.  V. Alcohol Removal®  Alcohol was removed from the aftercut formulation with no solubility problem. When alcohol was compensated with water again  there was no solubility problem. Cigarettes were prepared with the W modified aftercut solutions. The cigarettes were subjectively indis- © tinquishable from control cigarettes by members of the Flavor Develop-N ment Division. nt _ VI.

Your question about caffeine or nicotene is interesting to me because both seem to stimulate physiological processes at low levels. I did begin one draft of my review with the assertion that most people are familiar with the hormetic effects  of caffeine, nicotene and ethanol, but somehow it seemed a little trite!  I felt that to remain credible I ought to keep the examples I gave close to my own field of interest, so the review and my other papers on hormesis deal only with growth. I have not yet found examples in the literature of growth  hormesis with caffeine or nicotene.  In recent months we have been trying to see whether the explanations for growth hormesis in hydroids (reprint enclosed} applies to other organisms.  I have suggested that hormesis is due to regulatory over-corrections of a rate~sensitive feedback mechanism that controls growth in hydroids. We have been seeking evidence for a similar explanation in a marine input and have shown that it oscillates in the same suggestive way, but in the experiments thus far the extent.cf the growth stimulation is not statistically significant.  Please keep me informed of your own progress with hormesis.  With best wishes,  Yours sincerely,  Werace me  Oke J  ARD Stebbing  Enc.  .. CTR SP-FILES 019341 __label__Letter

Reynolds Tobacco Company Public Affairs Counsc)  P.O. Box 12945  Salem, OR 97309  Dear Mr. Nelson,  Certain industries in the United States, such as the tobacco industry, have been obligated to pay a disproportionate share of publicly funded health care costs.  With ap aging population and an increase in employer mandated health msurance requirements al the state level. costs to the tobacco industry are destined to increase. Only drastic changes in the health care delivery system can prevent this spirating cosi.  Market research indicates 90% of Oregonians want alternative medicine included in their health  plan. That is why the 1995 Oregon Legislature passed an alternative medicine bill, which was limited in scope.  The New England Jounal of Medicine published a national study done by Harvard University, in 1993, which determined that over one-third of Americans use some form of non-traditional health  care and pay for it out of their own pocket. This will not change if managed care and insurance comparucs have their way.  Meanwhile, profit and not for-profit forces have overtly pressured physicians into the anemviable funcuon of commercial agent to increase the profitability of health care organizations. This subjective distortion of the physician’s obligation has put at risk the historical trust that is the central element of the physician-patient relationship. Health care professionals are increasing!y faced with the dilemma of choosing between patient welfare and the profit of the health care dclivery system. We believe this is neither good health care nar beneficial to you and aur society.  That's why Orcgonians have launched the Health Care Freedoms Lmtiative (HCFI }, which will: ° help assure ciuizens* choice of category of health care provides, 6 put the patient back into the consumer's role:  ° lower the overall cost of health care,  e clear away many of the obstacles between pauient and provider and once again allow the free market to work TIOR 0023662 hE TY Vb fone von y __label__Letter

As presented in your August 5, 1997 letter, the Department approves the installation and operation of a FAS unit at Building 601-1, Whitaker Park. RIRT may proceed with the installation and operation of the FAS unit as permitting is not triggered by this modification.  For this modification, the Department accepts the assumption VOC emissions by direct application of natural menthol at a maker will not significantly affect the current emission factor used for this process. However, in the future, should additional FAS units be planned, including menthol application to other brands, we would request certification of VOC emissions by use of appropriate data which may include emissions stack testing. This certification would then be used to validate the assumption of no increase to VOC emissions by addition of natural menthol  (FAS unit) at a maker in lieu of processing Tobaccoville Casing and Cutting mentholated product.  537 North Spruce Street - Winston-Salem, NC 27101-1362 - Phone 910-727-8060 - Fax 910-727-2777  & Recycled Paper     Lye6 99¢2eS __label__Letter

June 15, 1978 No oh BY nn     Mr. J. H. Sherrill, Jr.  RE: IMPROVED WINSTON KING RSM TESTING     Three RSM type tests have been conducted on Full Flavor Non-Menthol products to date:  1. Original RSM Test (1976) - A feasibility test incorporating six key product variables and 27 test products to test the RSM methodology for application to our product testing (5 additional products were used to validate the results).  2. FF Non-Menthol Screening Test (1977) - A test incorporating 16 product variables and 20 test products to determine the relative importance of the product variables in terms of their effects  on consumer product acceptability.  3. Improved WINSTON King RSM Test (1978) - A 45 blend RSM test incor- porating seven key product variables and ranges determined from the previous screening and RSM work designed to test against Marketing action standards for an improved product.  All of the test products were tested on a paired basis through NFO among WINSTON, Marlboro, and Other NIF smokers. WINSTON King was used as the control product throughout in the 1976 and 1977 studies. In the current 1978 study, WINSTON King was the control product among WINSTON smokers and Marlboro was the control among Marlboro and Other  NFF smokers.  The results of these studies have been used to develop RSM models which include the effects of the seven key product variables on consumer product acceptability, tar level, nicotine level, and other laboratory measured variables. Approximately 85% of the variation in consumer preference is explained by the RSM model, indicating a good "fit" to the data.  \  In addition to having actual results of 97 product variations tested over a wide range, the RSM model can be used to "simulate" any number  of products over the entire range of the variables studied fin order  to determine areas of product types which would meet the Marketing action standards. Over a half million products were simulated using  the RSM model. The results indicate that less than 1% of these products would meet the action standards and, of those, about 90% fall into four narrow ranges of the variables tested. Table I, attached, lists the entire range of each variable tested along with the four areas of "potential" products which would meet action standards.     Reon SLLOS __label__Letter

Box 1556  Little Rock, AR 72203  Dear Maurice,  The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which is an arm of the U.S. Congress, is preparing a report on the likely economic effects of a federally mandated ban on smoking in virtually all buildings in the country. The legislation would affect just about everyplace except one’s home.  The OTA may be asking leaders of the hospitality industry for their input on this proposal. They would be particularly interested in possible economic impact. While there may not be any rigorous scientific studies of the economic effect of such a proposal, I am certain you can understand the potential for great harm to your members.  It is not out of the question to assume that many smokers would simply not patronize restaurants and other hospitality venues at all, or at least with substantially less frequency, if they are not permitted to smoke anywhere in the building. As lam certain you agree, the marketplace is well situated to accommodate smokers and nonsmokers without additional mandates from government at any level.  Should you be contacted by someone from OTA about this report they are preparing, I would be grateful if you would let me know.     TI1632-1601 __label__Letter
Hogue, Brenda G.  Human Coronavirus Receptors  Background and Significance  Coronaviruses are one of 14 RNA virus families that infect humans and a broad range of domestic animal species. Some of the viruses appear to be zoonotic. They are a medically important group of viruses exhibiting tropisms for the lung, intestine, liver, brain, kidney, eye, heart, and peritoneum resulting primarily in respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. In humans, they are known to cause acute respiratory infections and gastroenteritis. However, they have been implicated in association with acute lethal necrotizing enterocolites in children (Science 229:978, 1985), chronic enterocolites or Sprue (Dig. Dis.Sci. 27:1039, 1982), pericarditis (J. Med. Virol. 6:259, 1980) and multiple sclerosis (Science 209:933, 1980; Ann. Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol, in press). Two recent studies show that a significant sample of multiple sclerosis brain tissue was positive when either specific probes or PCR were used to detect coronavirus nucleic acid (Ann, Neurol. 31:525, 1992; Talbot et al, Virol., in press). This is particularly significant since coronaviruses infect humans and could possibly serve as a cofactor in such a neurological disease. Recently a primate model was used to show that the primate CNS is susceptible to infection with coronaviruses (Virol 188:274, 1992). It has been clearly shown that coronaviruses can target to the brain of experimentally infected mice (Perlman, et al., 1989, 1990). It seems reasonable to postulate that such may also occur in humans during the course of a "normal respiratory infection" with these viruses. It is well documented that coronaviruses can readily establish persistence in both tissue culture and in the animal. This may apply to humans as well. Our proposed studies are significant in that they will increase our understanding of the initial step in infection of the human respiratory tract by coronaviruses and allow us to begin studies toward understanding how these viruses also infect the CNS.  Three receptors have been identified thus far for coronaviruses. The receptor for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus-A59 (MHV-A59) is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family. Aminopeptidase N, also known as CD13, was recently identified as the receptor for the human coronavirus-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Nature 357:417; 420, 1992). All of these coronaviruses have two major envelope proteins, the spike (S) and matrix (M). In all cases S interacts with the receptor. Some coronaviruses have, in addition to the S and M, a third major envelope protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). BCV, a bovine coronavirus, expresses HE and this protein can use N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac3) as a receptor determinant to initiate an infection (J. Gen. Virol. 73:901, 1992). The data from this study suggests that a second receptor may be involved. The receptor(s) for the human coronavirus OC43 has not been identified. HCV-OC43 does bind Neu5,9Ac> on erythrocytes (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:4526); however, we do not know if :hig is a receptor determinant on cells that are normally infected by this virus. Data from __label__Scientific
The Tobacco Institute . June 16, 1995  1995 STATE UPDATE & OUTLOOK TOBACCO LEGISLATION, REGULATION & BALLOT MEASURES  OVERVIEW  To date, 49 state legislatures have convened their 1995 sessions. Kentucky, the only state not scheduled to have a regular session this year, has already held a special session on taxes. Lawmakers in 33 states have adjourned their regular sessions, and an additional six states are expected to adjoum by the end of June. Ilinois and Michigan lawmakers have completed their regular session business  and have recessed for the summer, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are expected to do the same by the end of this month.  TAXES     Despite opposition efforts, legislators in South Dakota passed the first tobacco tax increase in 1995. The bill, signed by Governor Janklow on March 16, adds 10 cents to the current 23-cent cigarette excise tax, imposes a new 10% tax on other tobacco products, and establishes the state legislature as exclusive regulator of matters relating to the use of tobacco products. A second tax increase was signed into law on April 12 by Vermont Governor Dean. Included in the funding for indigent health care were a 24-cent cigarette tax hike and 21% increase in the OTP tax rate.  An Oregon tax bill awaits Governor Kitzhaber’s approval. The bill would extend the sunset date for 10 cents of the current 38-cent cigarette excise tax until January 1, 1998; the tax was scheduled to be reduced this year. Other attempts to raise the cigarette tax in Oregon failed this year. In Wisconsin, a group of legislators requested a 50-cent hike in the cigarette excise tax; however, the Joint Finance Committee reported its budget without any tobacco taxes. Wisconsin legislators may still introduce a  separate bill to recover the state’s “smoking-related” expenditures or attempt to amend the budget. Eight other states are considering cigarette tax increases.  Thus far this year, cigarette tax increases have been defeated in 14 states, including a 25.1-cent hike in Florida, 40-cent hike in Hawaii and 18-cent increase in Montana. Lawmakers in Minnesota rejected seven bills to increase tobacco taxes and seven more attempts to amend the House omnibus tax bill. Also, attempts in Washington to repeal the 26-cent cigarette tax increase, scheduled to be implemented over the next two years, were unsuccessful.  9209 96ETS __label__Report

PRELIMINARY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING ON ELDERLY POPULATION AT HIGH RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE  The only proven risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) other than age, is a positive family history of AD. However, it was not until work eondueted by Breitner and Folstein that it beeame clear how powerful an effect genetics may play in AD (1). According to these investigators Alzheimer's probands with characteristic symptoms of apraxia or aphasia, have first degree relatives whose cumulative incidence of AD approaches 50% by age 90. These results may suggest that the most common form of Alzheimer's disease is transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene, but the pattern of inheritance is difficult to detect in many studies because most people with the gene do not live long enough to show AD. When the mortality tables for the United States population are superimposed on this genetic model of Alzheimer's disease, it is apparent that approximately one-sixth of all  first degree relatives will develop Alzheimer's disease during their lifetime.  Figure 1 provides additional evidence in favor of genetic causes in Alzheimer's disease. This figure summarizes results from the study of approximately 60 AD cases (probands) and 300 first degree relatives. As was predicted by previous work, these first degree relatives have a cumulative incidence of Alzheimer's disease that approaches 50% by age 90. Although other models of inheritance could fit these data, the data are clearly consistent with the suggestion that Alzheimer's disease is caused by an autosomal dominant gene whose  expression occurs very late in life.  Whatever genetic model is used to explain these data, it is clear that first degree relatives of Alzheimer's patients constitute a group at high risk for the expression of Alzheimer's disease, and that this risk increases dramatically with  age. Hence, this is an ideal population in which to study factors affecting the     50287561 __label__Scientific

THOMAS J. STEICHEN Master Statistician Research & Development  * Winston-Salem, NC 27102 910-741-4084 Fax: 910-741-1430  March 8, 1996  Dr. Geoffrey C. Kabat  Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine Albert Einstein College of Medicine  Belfer Building Rm. 1302  1300 Morris Park Avenue  Bronx, NY 10461-1601  Dear Dr, Kabat:  I recently reviewed your paper, “Relation between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in lifetime nonsmokers” (Kabat GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL. Am. J. Epidemiol. 142(2):141-8, 1995), and noted a logical inconsistency that likely  indicates a minor error.  Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you list the odds ratios for males for exposure in childhood as 0.90 for “yes” (i.e., any exposure), 1.12 for “1 smoker in the household,” and 1.13 for “2+ smokers in the household.” These two later categories merely partition the “yes” category, therefore the OR for “yes” should be some weighted average of the OR’s for the sub-categories and should fall between 1.12 and 1.13. This is, unfortunately, not true in the published table, thus one or more of the OR must, I believe, be incorrect.  I calculated crude OR’s and CI’s from your published case and control counts for each exposure category and was surprised to find that the crude results for “yes/no” identically replicated your published results. This was surprising because you indicated on page 142 that “[u}nconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of exposure with adjustment for covariates, including age, education, and type of hospital.” Does Table 2 contain adjusted or crude results? Your paper does not clearly state if the results in Table 2 are, or are not, adjusted. My calculated crude results for “1 smoker in the household” was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2,06) and for “2+ smokers in the household” was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.31-2.45), These calculated crude sub-category results are logically consistent with the published, dichotomous “yes/no” results.  wrk for smokers.”     C862 LSLTS __label__Letter

I.  II.  4 Lo pd), |fe  MANAGEMENT SUMMARY ‘_- IN REM SECRET  - No._225_ By. Background History  REAL FILTER and MENTHOL were introduced nationally on 6/13/77, 4 months ago. REAL is positioned in the fast-growing Hi-Fi category as the only major brand with "nothing artificial added" -- capitalizing on recent consumer interest in all-natural products  to differentiate the Brand from all other cigarettes. Based on pre~- market concept research, low "tar" and good taste are the consumer benefits which make the Brand important to consumers. The Brand is targeted to young adults, especially males, with emphasis on a rich, masculine tone in advertising--on judgment, distinctly unique versus  the more “clinical" pack/copy approach used by the leading Hi-Fi brands (VANTAGE and Merit). Pre-market research indicated strong  and broad-based appeal for REAL, so it received very heavy intro- ductory spending support to capitalize on this potential.           Business Review     REAL's performance thus far in 1977 has been disappointing. Shipments forecasted for total year 1977 are only 66% of the original goal:  Total Year 1977     Volume SOM  Original Goal 3.64 bil. 6%  ‘Current Forecast 2.40 bil.* 4% (¢ of Goal) ; (66%)  * Inflated by an estimated net pickup from retailers/ jobbers of 200 million units. Given a heavy initial load-in and lower than expected movement, pickup was required to balance inventories and assure fresh product.  Although REAL's spending in 1977 was at a significantly high rate versus previous RJR new brand introductions, its impact was some- what diluted by the national introduction of 19 competitive new brand items (all low "tar") during the year. Importantly, Merit's first year expenditures accounted for a greater share of both low "tar" category and new brand expenditures than did REAL's.  REAL ; Merit July-Dec. 1977.

Ettenburgh EH10-S5BJ Scotland, United Kingdom:  Dear Dr. Chisholm  Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support.. I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants. currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step. process, comprising a | preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal. To accomplish the first step,  potential applicants should submit a brief preliminary outline (3 to 4 pages total) of the study  for which support.is sought. It should contain the f. ollowing. information:  1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.  2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to. be taken.  3. Anticipated duration and. annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years.. Although grants are. made for. one year at a time, up. to: two annual renewals can. be considered. on the basis. of progress. reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.  It would. also be helpful to have:  1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.  2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.  Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for "fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May.31 and November 30; activation is typically seven months later.  Sincerely,  Harmon McAllister  Encl __label__Letter

SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY This method is applicable to the Agrochemical Sciences Department or anyone performing the analysis of maleic hydrazide on tobacco at STRL.  SAFETY AND OPERATING PRECAUTIONS  Personnel must be thoroughly acquainted with the potential hazards of the reagents, products, salvents. equipment, and procedures used in the facility. The current Material Safety Data Sheets for the chemicals used in this method should be consulted.  WASTE GENERATION, HANDLING, AND DISPOSAL Follow all relevant company Standard Operating Procedures, state and local ordinances.  INTERFERENCE  Flasks must be clean, dry and free of zine before analyzing any samples. Any residual zine left in a flask would react with the MH in the pre-digestion phase, thus giving lower results, Any water left in the flask would have to be bytled off prior to reaching the proper temperature. Also, tobacco would have a tendency to cling to the flask if wet, not allowing all of the sample to be pre-digested.  EQUIPMENT Spectrophotometer: Shimadzu UV-160, UV-visible recording spectrophotometer  Automatic temperature controller with thermocouple  Syringe pump with the ability to house at least 50 ml. syringe  Ring stand equipped with clamps and ring supports  Gas burner  Specially designed MH-30 flasks.

Fackelman  SUBJECT: FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: PRICE-CONSCIOUS AND PRESTIGE CATEGORIES     The following white paper by Doug Weber discusses the future development of  the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories. This document is in response to your request for a “think piece" on how these two categories might develop in  the next five years.  In the document three separate scenarios are discussed. Each scenario differs in the amount of growth achieved by the Price-Conscious and Prestige categories by 1988. These variations are supported by hypotheses regarding industry competitive actions and reactions, marketing resource availability, technical capabilities, and economic and social pressures facing cigarette  consumers.  Also included is a description of factors that may impact the likelihood of each scenario and the future development of the market.  Finally, we have included specific recommendations for RJR. These recommendations address the need to:  1. Prevent the occurrence of an RJR competitive disadvantage in the Price-Conscious category. Specifically, we need to be prepared to  introduce new Price-Conscious brands, plot potential competitive moves, and increase our intelligence activities to ensure ourselves  maximum lead-times.  2. Explore all possible opportunities and positions within the Prestige category.  3. Place high priority on the development of products and other elements  of our marketing mix that will provide us superior brand propositions and competitive advantages. This could be done through improved technologies, more efficient distribution systems, and more effective promotional tools.

18789791 12:16 DUMC DEPT OF MICROBIOLOGY’ IMMUN @@5  Deb lie 7  MAX E. GOTTESMAN #3280 Role of DNA binding proteins in gene expression  DNA exists in prokaryotic cells in compacted form, the result of supercoiling and interaction with histone-like proteins. At least six such DNA-binding proteins have been identified one of which, the £, coli integration host factor (IHF), is of considerable interest because it participates in diverse reactions such as site-specific transposition and inversion recombination, phage DNA packaging, plasmid and phage DNA replication, and positive and negative control of gene expression. IIIF consists of two subunits, a and B, that are encoded by the himA and himD gene, respectively. They resemble in sequence the subunits of the HU protein (with similar functions). However, unlike HU, IHF binds to a specific DNA sequence in the DNA minor groove, inducing a sharp, stable bend.  Many genes in &. coli and its bacteriophages are regulated by IHF. In particular, it interacts with the pL promoter of lambda. Although one of the strongest promoters in vivo, pL has rather poor homology to known bacterial promoters and binds RNP with low efficiency in vitro. pl transcription is stimulated three~to~four-fold by IHF, both in vivo and in vitro. IHF bends DNA at tandem sites located upstream of pL; it also enhances formation of RNP-promoter closed complexes. The applicant has now identified a second upstream promoter, pl2, which is repressed by IHF. So the specific aims of this application are, first, to extend our understanding of the role of IHF in the control of promoter activity; second, to identify the functional  domains of IHF; and third, to isolate E. coli genes encoding novel auxilliary DNA-binding proteins and to Study their function, and to uncover additional E. coli genes regulated by IHF. He would also like to extend these studies from E. coli to evolutionarily related bacteria and to eukaryotic systems. Clearly all this is a huge undertaking.  The background information already gathered on this system is fascinating. For example, the pL2 promoter is only one-tenth as active as pLl and is repressed by IHF; but mutations in pL1 that decrease pLi __label__Report

10/9/90 CC: CTR STAFF  Michael J. Brennan, M.D.  Roth, J.A. #2903  This well wriczten proposal from an experienced clinical investigator proposes to do an exhaustive exploration of the hypothesis that TGF-alpha produced by NSCLC cells is bound by the EGF-R present in increased quantity on many such cells to complete an autocrine growth stimulatory loop.  The methods to be employed are advanced immunological, cell-biological, and molecular biological methods. The studies employ cell cultures, nude mouse implantations, molecular genetic techniques and monoclonal antibody production along with DNA transfections utilizing sense and antisense sequences.  Ready access so lung cancer operative specimens is available and specially derived cell-lines and DNA constructs are at hand. Availability of the mutated K-ras oncogene which exhibits a point mutation in about half the tested cases of adenocarcinoma of the lung enabled the author and his associates to clone this K-ras in an antisense orientation in the APr-l-neo expression vector.  Consequently, it will be possible to determine whether the growth-stimulatory effect of TGF-alpha on NSCLC cells is dependent on the presence of an alzered K-ras product as well as to determine whether the TGF-alpha/EGF-R interaction fulfills all the criteria for proving that an autocrine loop exists in NSCLC.  The author's intellectual and scholarly command of his topic is manifest in the proposal. His own laboratory background appears to be in immunology when judged by his listed publications. The only closely related manuscrip: is a preprint of which Dr. Roth is the principal author.  Dr. Fang did ais undergraduate work at National Taiwan University in chemistry and toox his master's in that field at Carnegie Mellon and a doctorate in Bio-organic Chemistry at West Virginia. He came to M.D. Anderson in 1988. His bibliography is very limited.  CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O. INUS v. PM ET AL. 99CV2496 (SCIENTIFIC PEER-REVIEW MATERIAL) __label__Scientific

Geiszler Milprint Tipping flor Marlboro Lights  Six master rolls of Marlboro Lights tipping from Milprint have been run to date on the mechanical perforators at 20th Street. This tipping is printed  on Schweitzer's GSR-110 basesheet.  The master rolls fave run well on the perforators and slitters. The gold  contral line seems to be working satisfactorily on the Fife guide sensors. It has not been necessary to make slitting knife adjustments to keep the print  in registration on the slitter.  There are areas where some improvement can be: made to the Milprint master rolls:  1. Each master roll should have a unique identification number.  2. The rolls should be stacked with cores vertical, rather than cores horizontal, on the pailliets.  3. The trim from each edge of the master roll broke several times during slitting, especially the trim from the edge without the guideline. Increasing that trim width to 20mm should help prevent the breakage and subsequent entanglement.     {/bjw  cc: R. Carnes Jl. Cooper  098492.000T __label__Memo

BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO CORPORATION  feng West Hill Street +P QO. Box J5090+ Louisville, Kentucky M282  June 30, 1978  Mr. Wyatt Williams PKG  Dear Wyatt:  Ted, Gary, and I spent the day in Little Rock yesterday riding the Rich Lights’ showing and we were pleased to find that, with one exception, all the postings were in very food condition.  The one exception was a 30-Sheet board posted at 7th and Park which was flagging and was also obscured by atree. Due to the limited visibility, we recommend that that posting be moved to a different location as opposed to simply correcting the flagging problem.  There were also two locations that we could not find. One is indicated on the map as a new location at U.S. 67 and 167 near the Little Rock Air Force Base, and the other was indicated on the map at the Junction of U.S. 70 and 130. The only 30-sheet locations near the latter point were Bordon and Camel Lights. Could you please advise the status of these two locations.  Finally, we saw a VICEROY parent 30-sheet location located  inbound on Highway 167 one mile west of the Rixie exit which was virtually falling apart (the physical structure and the paper). The structure had Baird on it, not Donrey. The location is very good;  however, we should not be paying for it due to its condition. We  would like to have the board completely stripped since its advertising value is worthless and, in its present condition, is probably detrimental. Could you please check this out for us.  _ Wyatt, our net impression is that, given that the Little Rock plant a "is pretty average, to start with, Rich Lights now looks better, as _ "far as posting conditions go, than any other showing: in the market.

The maximum difference was found being less than 1% that indicates the precise set-up for the two stage  gold amalgamation system.  The trap efficiency of Au-Pt gauze was studied by connecting two Au-Pt traps in serial and the mercury  amount was analyzed independently. The amount of mercury breakthrough, based on the second Au-Pt  trap, was found to be 1% for 5 ng of Hg and 1.5% for 10 ng of Hg.  The instrament LOD, 0.011 ng, was determined based on 10 replicates of purge and trap of reagent blanks.  The method LOD, 0.1 ng, was also determined based on 10 replicates of smoking blanks.  3 ng of Hg was spiked onto the Au trap before smoking the 1R4F cigarette for method accuracy study.  Only 60% recovery of Hg was recovered, which can not justify the performance of gold trap, Two reasons  for this poor recovery, one is that the amount of Au was not enough to trap both mercury and volatile  organic vapor passing through electrostatic precipitation, and the other is the deactivation of the Au trap  caused by some organic vapor. To solve this problem, a catalyst converter is going to be placed before  gold trap to decompose organic vapor before the gas phase of smoke entering the Au trap.  gergoebeso7  DOC CODE: P0622 __label__Memo
_—a 3970 Association of Profilin with Filament-free Regions of  Human Leukocyte and Platelet Membranes and Reversible Membrane Binding during Platelet Activation  John H. Hartwig,** Kristen A. Chambers,* Karen L. Hopcia,* and David J. Kwiatkowski**  ® Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, and * Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology and § Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston,  Massachusetts 02114  Abstract. Profilin is a conserved, widely distributed actin monomer binding protein found in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian profilin reversibly sequesters actin monomers in a high affinity profilactin complex. In vitro, the complex is dissociated in response to treat- ment with the polyphosphoinositides, phosphatidylino- sitol monophosphate, and phosphatidylinosito) 4,5- bisphosphate. Here, we demonstrate the ultrastructural  ROFILIN is a 12-15-kD cytoplasmic actin monomer P binding protein of eukaryotic cells (Carlsson ¢1 al., 1976: Magdolen et al., 1988; Reichstein and Korn, 1979). Mammalian profilin occurs as a single isotype (Ampe et al., 1988; Kwiatkowski and Bruns, 1988) and interacts with actin monomers to sequester them from recruitment into actin filaments. In vitro, the affinity of mammalian spleen profilin for skeletal muscle actin monomer is relatively tow. Ks = 1-50 pM (Markey et al., 1982; Nishida, 19853, is higher for nonmuscle actin, K, = 10-400 nM (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988), whereas profilin and actin can be puri- fied as a high affinity, K, = 1-10 nM, profilactin complex cells (Blikstad et al., 1980; Carlsson et al., 1976; Hanis and Weeds, 1978; Malm, 1984; Markey et al... 1978). The factor(s) responsible for the high affinity profilactin complex have not been identified (Larsson and Lindberg. 1988). The transien) appearance of the high affinity compiles before and/or during platelet activation (Lind ct al., 1987, Markey et al., 1981) suggests that some mechanism exists in- side cells for its rapid formation and dissociation. Lassing and Lindberg (1985) have demonsteated that the high affinity complex can be dissociated by treatment with the polyphos- Phoinositides, phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP).' and phosphatidylinosito! 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) in vitro. More recently, human platelet profilin has been shown to bind PIP and PIP, reconstituted into vesicles in vitro (Lass- ing and Lindberg, 1988; Goldschmidt-Clermont, P.. J. Bal- dassare, and T.

In both cell types, a significant fraction of profilin is found associated with regions of cell membrane devoid of actin filaments and other discern- ible structures. After platelet activation, the membrane association of profilin reversibly increases. This study represents the first direct evidence for an interaction between profilin and phospholipids in vivo.  notan interaction between phosphoinositides and profilin oc- curs in vivo and whether this interaction regulates the transi- tion between the high and tow affinity states of the profilactin complex.  PIP and PIP; consist of an acidic, phosphorylated inositol side group connected to a glycero! backbone to which two long hydrophobic acy! chains are attached. They are. there- fore, likely to reside in cellular membrane compartments, and indeed are widely thought to be localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Garrett and Redman, 1975; Maucoet al., 1987). The presence of rnultip!e distinct meta- bolic pools of PIP and PIP; in erythrocytes and platelets (Billah and Lapetina, 1982; King et al., 1987). suggests. moreover, that some PIP and PIP; are sequestered in the plasma (and perhaps othe intracellular) membrane(s). pos- sibly due to binding to cytoplasmic proteins (Anderson and Marchesi, 1985: Sheetz et al., £982).  In support of an intracellular interaction between profilin and membrane-bound PIP and PIP;, here we provide direct morphologic evidence for a close association of a large por- tion of cellular profilin with membranes in both intact human platelets and 'Wakocytes. In addition. we demonstrate a re- versible. transient association between profilin and plasma membrane after the activation of platelets, consistent with previous observations of the formation/dissociution of pro- fitactin complexes during platelet activation.

O5/02/04 10:53 @ 19107274902 W. KLEIN & ASSOC. «== PUBLIC RELATIONS [003,004  FACT CARD: Good Arguments Against The Government's Proposed Smoking Ban  Our federal government is pushing two proposals that would ban smoking almost everywhere  nee “aT he first threat Is HR 3434, the sweeping new bill proposed by Congressman Hanry then ~.. Waxman, It would ban smoking in virtually all indoor public places — plus eame outdoor ones) “fa  hea second threat comes from OSHA = the Occupational Safety and Health Ps:2 Administration. These unglectad bureaucrats want to outlaw smoking in nearly all workplaces  nationwide. Here are some strong arguments against these government bans. Fee! free to make these points (in your own words) when you write to Congress.          « Secondhand smoke Isn't the Issue. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a Class A carcinogen. But this finding has drawn criticism fromm prominent scientists. The Congressional Research Service has called the EPA's report into question. And the report Is being challenged in court. OSHA should base Its regulations on sound sclence — not political science.  * The current system works. Across America, employers, building managers, and local  elected officials have designed smoking policies that work. Smoking and nonsmoking sections are the norm in most areas. And according to polls, two-thirds of Americans  find this arrangement acceptable. So there’s no need for the federal government to further reguiate this Issue.  * The proposed regulations go too far. In some cases, the proposed rules would invade the privacy of the homa. if you pay aomeane to work inside your home, you  could be prohibited from smoking there,  ¢ This Is just another attempt at backdoor Prohibition. These government proposals represent the anti-smokere’ latest campaign to erase smoking from American culture.  These politicians have a political agenda, and it has nothing to do with protecting non- smokers from secondhand smoke. But it Prohibition Is what the anti-smokers want, let  them stand up in Congress and put Prohibition to a vote. They'll find that the majority of Americans do not want a return to Prohibition!  Other Steps You Can Take To Stop Government Smoking Bans:  + Write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper. Use the points above to argue against the proposed smoking bans. Keep your letter short (about 260 words). For the address where you should send your letter, see your newspaper's editorial page.  « Talla friend about the proposed bans. R.J.

I THE WALL STREET JOURNAL MONDAY, APRIL 8, 1996 BS           RJR Is Planning Final Market Test  For New Cigarette  By Suen L. Hwanc  And Timotuy Noay Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, is taking the final steps to prepare Eclipse, its new low-smoke cigarette, for the consumer “market amid an effort to gather support  from antismoking forces. .  Officials at No. 2 cigarette maker Rey- nolds say they are readying Eclipse for  final market testing, slated to take place in the Chattanooga, Tenn., are je next six to ela weeks. igned to  é and cancer-causing tars by heating rather than burning tobacco, Eclipse marks the latest in a long and troubled quest by the cigarette industry to come up with a safer product. .  The company ts “happy with the prod- uct,” and wants to test a few marketing messages, said David Fishel, a spokesman for the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. unit. “We've done very extensive focus-group testing, and we want to get one last look in the marketplace before we really consider selling," he said, adding that the Chatta- nooga test won't involve selling Eclipse to consumers,  Meanwhile, public-health officials say Reynolds is assembling a group of leading tobacco opponents to brief them on the technical details of Eclipse. At a time when the nation’s biggest clgarette makers are fighting a move by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco, the meeting appears to be an attempt by Reynolds to defuse opposition from to bacco-control forces against its unusual new product,  a ow Renee  ' Fences between the two.         —————  ‘one leading tobacco foe, New Jersey medicine professor John Slade, said Rey- nolds has invited him and other health advocates to a meeting about Eclipse, ten- tatively scheduled for Friday at the com- pany’s Winston-Salem, N.C., headquar- ters. Dr. Slade, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, said partici- pants will “gauge how each side feels about what the other has to say.”  ~ Reynolds's Mr. Fishel sald he wasn’t  " aware of any such meeting and declined to  comment. Reynolds's efforts with Eclipse follow its disastrous investment in & smokeless cigarette called Premier, which it withdrew in 1989 after just five months of test-marketing. In addition to attracting criticism from health advocates, Premier drew scant interest from smokers, many of whom found it too hard to light and disliked the taste.

Gvillevd  MEMORANDUM June 6, 1989  TO: H. J. Minnemeyer FROM: J. H. Bell  SUBJECT: Cigarette Modification Project Report  On Friday May 12 the writer met with Ms. S. Ireland and Dr. J. Reid to discuss a concern for a more concentrated effort in the reduction of certain cigarette smoke components which have been targeted in the cigarette modification project. Ms. Ireland and Dr. Reid were most receptive to the suggestion that a re-direc- tion of some activities was in order.  A catechol/phenol analysis has been developed and demonstrated by the writer. However, the method involves the same instrumenta- tion that is used for the BAP analysis. The sharing of this equipment proved to be very clumsy and resulted in a less effi- cient laboratory operation. Ms. Ireland has agreed to accept this analysis into her section and has assigned Dr. Aruna Prakash as the investigator. A Perkin-Elmer LS-40 Fluorescence Spectro- meter will be needed and is being purchased at this time.  Dr. Reid was agreeable to the suggestion that Dr. Paul Schickedantz's contribution to this project could best be made in the investigation of carbonyl removal. Methodologies from lab 10 will be transferred immediately to Dr. Schickedantz. Analytical procedures can be established in his laboratory in one week. The actual smoking of cigarettes and the proper use of the smoke collection system may be an initial problem. However, smoke samples can be provided to him until a more proficient protocol  is devised.  The NNN analysis which has always been run in the Tobacco Science Section will remain in that section, but will be done under the scrutiny of Dr. F. Perini. The results of the analysis have been rather erratic over the last few months. Variations in ng/cig or ppm have been as high as 100% while some recoveries have been as low as 1.5%. Dr. Perini will investigate these problems and make the necessary procedural changes. In addition, he has been asked to include NNK with the analysis. This will entail a more sophisticated clean-up procedure which does not include decolo-  rizing charcoal.  ETSSZELS __label__Memo

Savoca FROM: T. A. Perfetti  BRANDS R&D TEST DESIGN SUPPORT PROGRAM     o Several additional studies have been designed for Brands R&D during the third quarter of 1984. The major emphasis this quarter was on menthol related studies for the FF and FFLT Menthol Teams. The designed studies were mainly screening, in nature, and concentration of blend and casings variables.  CONSUMER SIMULATION MODEL PROGRAM  o FF and FFLT Non-Menthol Consumer Models  Modeling techniques have been used to predict 70+ acceptance and attribute ratings on NFO testing of FF and FFLT non-menthol cigarettes. These models have  been recently refined and are designed to predict acceptance and attributes for the following smoker groups testing RJR products:  FF competitive smokers  FF franchise smokers FFLT competitive smokers  FFLT franchise smokers  o0o000  The predictive capability of these models has been shown to be quite good and is based on cigarette design parameters relating to blend, casing, configurational terms, and combinations of these. Results from these studies have been presented  at the September WINSTON Task Force meeting and the September MDM meeting.  o FF and FFLT Menthol Consumer Models     Analytical data and NFO consumer data are presently being collected on 200 additional cases for the development of the FF and FFLT menthol models. These  additional cases represent competitive brand tests and prototypes tests submitted to NFO between 1981 and 1984. At present, the data on 40 cases has already been  completed. Preliminary models are anticipated to be generated by January, 1985.  o Consumer Test Data Base  Information continues to be added to this data base. At present information on 292 CT tests has been catalogued.  © Review of Competitive Brand Test Results  Information on the competitive wave results for thirteen RJR brands have been received, catalogued, and are currently being reviewed. This program went into effect as of September, 1984.     6SLb 680g __label__Letter

3-27-81  Dr. Vincent Lisanti  The Council for Tobacco Research ~ USA, Inc. 110 E. 59th Street  New York City, NY 10022  Dear Dr. Lisanti:  Jack Frankel asked that 1 write to you with regard to two points on the coefficient, Yule's Q.  Q is a measure of association between two variables that have each been classified into dichotomies. Thus it contrasts with the most conventional measure of association, Pearson's Product-moment Corre- dation (r),in that the latter relates two variables that are each measured on continuous interval scales. It compares in that both measures have a theoretical range from +1.0 to -1.0, representing perfect direct orinverse associations, respectively.  Pearson's r isbased on the product moments for each data point represented on a bivariate surface. Thus, it is based on the weighted sum of signed distance vectors from the bivariate mean. It therefore requires interval scals measuring the variables.  In contrast, Q does not assume known distances between points on the scales. Only two points are represented for each variable (e.g. - high x low, on x off, cancer x non-cancer, etc). The data are thus classified into four cells (as in the table I sent to Jack).  A fair description of Q may be found in J.H. Mueller and K.F. Schuessler, Statistical Reasoning in Sociology, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin, 1961, pp 242-249.     Sincerely,  Richard J.

No 200.€1983,     IS EPA BLOWING ITS OWN SMOKE?  How Much Science Is Behind Its Tobacco Finding?  By Michael Fumento In Los Angeles.  “Taken together, the total weight of evidence is conclusive that environmental tobacco smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers.”  So declared Environmental! Protec- tion. Agency: Administrator William Reilly at.a news conference earlier this month, announcing the impending re- lease of an: EPA: reporti attributing approximately. 3,000: deaths a year to passive smoking, or environmental tobacco smoke.  Yet many in the scientific and! medi- cal community say the data the EPA cites does not bear out its conclusion.  While’ virtually: all. scientists agree that smoking is unhealthful — both for smokers and those:around them — it’s the degree. to which smoking is un- healthfyl|_and the way the government musters its scientific case, that raises questions.  Some scientists andi policy analysts who say. they. couldn'ti care less about tobacco company profits or even the rights. of smokers: are worrying aloud that the EPA report is paving the way for:justifying new health-based'govern- mentiregulations and'programs without any real science behind them.  Said Bonner: Cohen, editor of EPA  Smoking Gun? Relative risk:ofilung cancer 100  General population  White male smokers  White female smakers  Colorado miners exposed ito radon gas  119 Passive smokers  Sources: EPA, National Research Council, Amaican Cancer Society  Watch based in Chantilly, Va., “It's now. open season on whatever contami- nant the EPA chooses to label the killer contaminant of the week, with the effect that once again, Americans are going to be. stampeded into fearing:a: substance for reasons which upon close inspection: are scientifically indefensible.’  Yale University epidemiologistiAlvan: Feinstein, writing in the journal Toxico- logical Pathology, said he recently  heard a prominentileader in epidemio- logy admit of the BPA‘s work on passive smoking: “Yes, it’s rotten’ sci- ence, but it’s in a worthy cause. Iti will help us to get rid of cigarettes and to: become a smoke-free society.”  Another criuc, Alfred P. Webiner, presidenti of Biomedical and Environ- mental Consultants Inc., in Richland, Wash., said: “I did work for the EPA in the: past and. thoughti of them rea- sonably well, but. when I saw. that report, I was really embarrassed. It was a bad document”  One thing both sides: agree on is that the direct policy ramifications of the EPA report could be tremendous.  “You can bet your next: paycheck that OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) will ban all smoking in the workplace,”” said John Shanahan, the environmental policy analyst atithe Heritage Foundation.  Although, in unveiling the report. Reilly expressly referred to: cancer in children and in the workplace, the statistical! analysis in the EPA report actually ignored the studies that looked forisuch links.  Rather, the EPA survey. is based' on II! American studies of spouses of. smokers. The report discussed, but' did not. put into its statistical analysis, the results of 19 other studies done outside the U.S.  In its analysis ofithose 11 studies, the EPA. found that there was a “statisti- cally significant” difference in the num- ber of lung cancers. suffered by. non- smoking spouses of smokers, equal to 119-such cancers in nonsmoking spouses of smokers compared to 100 lung: cancers in nonsmoking spouses of non- smokers.  This finding of statistical significance allowed it to rank passive smoking as a: Class. A carcinogen, the highest risk ranking possible.  Statistical! significance, while sound- ing like arcane academic talk, is actually quite important. It is used to account for the possibility that something happened  | — ini this case the 19. additional! lung  cancers — by.chance.  But critics say, that, using its. own previous statistical standards, the EPA reportishows no such significance.  “Frankly, I was embarrassed! as a scientist with what they came up with. The main. problem was. the statistical handling: ofi the: data,” said Wehner, who headed a panel/ of scientists. and doctors that analyzed the drafti version of the EPA report! for the tobacco industry.  ‘Meta-Analysis’  One aspect of this problem, say. critics, involves the combination of the 11 studies into one. big group — what the EPA called a “meta-analysis.”  The EPA: has never before. done this. Critics say such combinations may. be valid, but. if the. studies .weren’t done in the same. way, the results: will be like comparing apples and oranges and pears.  Not everyone agrees.  “Meta-analysis is totally fair,” said Stanton Glantz of the Institute of Health Policy Studies at the University, of California, San Ftancisco.."I review. reports like that for the. State of Califor- nia, and the work the. EPA: did is absolutely firsti rate,, one of the best pieces of science I've seen about' any- thing.”  But Wehner said the study was faulty.  “To get scientificaily valid data, there are very strict rulés and requirements on how and when you can apply’ meta- analysis, and virtually.all of them were violated in the EPA analysis,” he said.  ‘Confidence Intervals’  The 11 studies together actually reflected 10 studies that showed no stalistically significanti increases in can- cer and only one that did. When the EPA says that the weight of! 11 studies showed harm from passive smoking, it really meant one positive combined with 10 neutrals.  More important than the use of the meta-analysis, say critics, is the EPA’s use, also for the first time, of a less rigorous statistical analysis.  Epidemiologists — those who study disease and accident: patterns to estab- lish why they occur — calculate ‘*confi- dénce intervals’ to express the likelihood that a result could have happened strictly. by chance.  A 95% confidence interval means that there is a 95% possibility that the result didn’t happen: from chance, or a 5% possibility thatit did.  Until the passive smoking report, the EPA has always used 2.95% confidence interval, as have most researchers doing: epidemiological studies. Indeed, all. of the individual ETS studies were pub- lished with 95% confidence intervals..  Yet). in. its averaging of those ETS studies, the EPA decided'to go witha 90% confidence interval.  “That doubles the chance ofi being wrong,” explained James Enstrom, a professor of epidemiology at the Uni: versity of California, Los Angeles.  Reilly said simply: “With respect to the confidence interval, we have here.a 90% confidence level. And that was, in fact,, what was recommended to us by the scientific community as appropriate to this data.” Repeated calls to the EPA to find out who in the scientific commu: nity had done so went unanswered. .  ‘Hairsplitting’ Factor  Glantz said ithe criticism of the change in the confidence. level is a: kindi of “hairsplitting that. only: professors care. about.”  Many ‘epidemiologists, however, dis- agree.  “In mosti cases, a scientist would never do this sort of thing,’’’ Enstrom said. “It's surprising that they would try to get away. with it.”  The bottom line is that such “‘Hairs- plitting” allowed the EPA to come toa totally, different conclusion than it wouldi have using its normal method.  It could now de- clare that the re- sults of the American studies, when lumped to- gether, were ‘‘sta- tistiecally significant,” a term of great impor- tance. to the medi- cal community.

The changes are as follows:  e Top payment now is $104.00 per month. On previous contract the payment was $119.00.  @ The lowest volume category (100-199) has been eliminated.  @ In stores having only one standard fixture, “one full shelf" is interpreted as either 12 or 16 rows per shelf, however, in stores with multiple racks, “one full shelf" must represent 16 rows, with extra rows being contiguous.  The purpose is to upgrade Lorillard's position in all stores when they only occupy 12 rows to 16 rows. However, their correspondence states that "if a retailer adamantly objects to giving Lorillard the required additional rows, do not jeopardize the arrangement -- we will grandfather those, locations."

Proc. Nan, Acad. Ser USA Vol. 87, pp. 3604-3608, May 1990 Piochenusiry  Evidence that retroviral transduction is mediated by DNA,  not by RNA  (Harvey murine sarcoma virus/Moleney murine retrovicus/provirus altcration/ transfection / recunsbination)  Davin W. GoooricH*® AND PEeTRR EL. DUESBERG  Deparemeat of Molecule and Cell biology. Uaiversity of California. Berkeley. CA 94720  Contributed by Peter H. Ducsberg, February 26, 1990  ABSTRACT Retroviral transduction of cellular nucleic acid sequences requires illegitimate RNA or DNA recombina- tion. To test a model that postulates transduction via efficient illegitimate recombination during reverse transcription of viral sand cellular RNAs, we have measured the ability of Harvey sarcoma viruses (HaS¥Vs) with artificial 3’ termini to recover a retroviral 3° terminus from helper Moloney virus (MoV) by iNegitimate and homologous recombination. For this purpose, mouse NIH 313 cells were transformed with Harvey proviruses and then superinfected with Mo¥. The proviruses lacked the 3’ long terminal repeat and an untranscribed region of the 5 long terminal repeat to prevent virus regeneration from input provirus. Only 0-H focus-forming units of HaSV were gen- erated upon Mo¥ superinfection of 3 106 cells transformed by Harvey proviruses with MoV-unrelated termini. This low frequency is consistent with iegitimate DNA recombination via random Mojoncy provirus integration 3° of the transform- ing viral ras gene in the 10°-kilobase mouse genome. When portions of murine vical envelope (env) genes were attached ¥ of ras, 10°-405 fucus-forming units of HaS¥ were generated, depending on the extent of homology with env of Mo¥. These recombinants all contained ElaS¥-specific sequences $' and MoV-specific sequences 3’ of the common env homology. They were probably generated by recombination during reverse transcription rather than by recombination among either input or secondary proviruses, since (i) the yield of recombinants was reduced by a factor of 10 when the env sequence was flanked by splice signals and (ii) HaSV RNAs without retroviral 3° termini would be inadequate templates for provirus synthesis. We conclude that there is no efficient illegitimate recombina- tion in retroviruses. In view of known precedents of illegitimate DNA recombination, the structure of known viral onc genes, and our evidence for illegitimate DNA recombination via provirus integration, we favor the DNA model of transduction over the RNA model.     Retroviral transduction of oncogenic sequences requires either RNA- or DNA-mediated illegitimate recombination. Based on an experimental system that appeared to involve “surprisingly efficient” illegitimate recombination by RNA template switching during reverse transcription (1), the RNA model is currently favored (1-11). This model holds that a retrovirus would integrate upstream of a proto-onc gence, spontaneously lose its 3’ terminus, or fail to terminate during transcription (9), and produce a 5S’ viral-3’ proto-onc MRNA. In a second step, the cellular 3’ region of this hybrid RNA would recombine with the nonhomologous 3’ region of an intact (helper) retrovirus during reverse transcription in order to obtain a retroviral 3’ termiaus. A competing DNA model holds that all steps of retroviral transduction are mediated by iMlegitimate primary DNA recombination (12).     The publication costs of thés article were defrayed in part by puge charge payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked “eddvertisentent™ in accordance with 18 U.S.C. $1734 solely to indicate this fact.  3604  40024983  The experimental systear on which the RNA madel is based showed efficient regeneration of Harvey murine suar- coma virus (HaSV} from cells that were transformed by a J -truncated Haevey provirus and then superinfected with Moloney virus (MoV). The mechanism was assumed to reflect efficient illegitimate recombinatian between HaSV RNA and MoV RNA ducing reverse transcription (1). How- ever, this system did not caciude HaS¥ regeneration involy-» ing recombination beliween elements of the input Harvey’ provirus alone. Indeed, the truncated input provirus con- tained an intact 5’ long leeninal repeat (1-TR}, a packaging sequence, and a complete transforming ras gene (1) and thus all the elements essential for regeneratian of infectious HaSV.  A reinvestigation of the above system demonstrated that the efficient regeneration of HaSV in this system depended entirely on an untranscribed U3 region trom the 5’ LTR of the truncated provirus (12). Since the RNAs transcribed from Harvey provirus with an intact §’ LTR, which did regenerate transforming virus, and from provicus with a truncated 5° LTR, which did not regencrate transforming virus, were identical, we conchided that HaSV regeneration did not involve illegitimate recombination with MoV during or after reverse transcription. Instead we proposed that FlaS¥ was regenerated from troncaled proviral DNA elements with intact 8" LTRs by illegitimate recombination during trans- fection (12). The high frequency of this process was sug- gested toreficct tandem integration during transfection of the Harvey provirus (12). Indeed, multiple Harvey proviruses were originally abserved in cells transformed by 3’-truncated Har proviruses (1, 13).  In an effort to distinguish between the two models of transduction, we have determined conditions under which a Harvey provirus with an artificial 3’ terminus can recover a correct retroviral ¥’ terminus from MoV by illegitimate and homologous recombination. HaSV regeneration from input provirus was precluded by studying proviruses with a single truncated, instead of a complete, §* LTR (12).        MATERIALS AND METHODS  Defective Harvey sarcoma proviruses with and without cav- related sequences were constructed as follows (Fig. 1). Harvey proviral plasmid pRSW was derived from pHI/ RSNhe (12). The L.t-kitobase (kb) Xba 1 (~151]}-Seee 1 [940] restriction fragment, containing the presumed Harvey RNA packaging signal (14, 15), was removed from pH1/R5Nhe, and the remaining Sac I sile [940] was modified by attach- ment of an Xba Elinker to make pRSNASX.

Thompson  ‘S/M Assay - DBC Burley(BU): Control vs DBC BU Treated     Four smokings of three samples were submitted by you for testing in the S/M assay (1). The objective of this study was to determine if the enzymatic treatment of tobacco by Genecor to remove insoluble proteins would lower the  S/M activity. For this experiment, DBC BU (control) was treated with Pronase®  and washed, also BU was sham treated; i.e., washed only. IT CSCs from the flour smokings of these handmade cigarettes. were tested in stnain TA98+S9 (2).     The preparation of the CSCs (10 mg/ml) was carried out by Charge No. 6908 personnel (3). The CSCs were stored at -80°C until tested. All of the CSCs were tested randomly at doses of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20: mg/plate according to the standard test procedures (4):  All of the control data (see addendum) were within normal ranges. except for 2AA which was slightly lower than normal. Each test sample demonstrated a dose-response and produced a response that was 2X background.  Table 1 illustrates the specific activity (S.A.) of the four smokings and also the analysis of variance (performed using, "Minitab"). At the p>0.05 ‘level of significance, the S.A.s of both the treated and sham treated samples were lower than the DBC BU control. While this result implites that the S/M activity can be lowered by just sham treatment or washing the tobacco, Table l also shows a significant difference in the S.A.s of the treated and sham treated; i.e., the S.A. of the Pronase® treated sample is lower. Since these data indicated that enzymatic treatment of tobacco can significantly lower S/M activity, further studies in this area may be warranted. It would be useful to also have complete filler analysis for these test samples, especially for total N and cations; however, this data was not available fior this experiment. It is recommended that such analyses be included ini any future studies.     The €SCs yields (mg/cigt)i and calculated total activities (T.A.) are reported in Table 2. Analysis of variance was also perfiormed for the T.A. data. The difference in T.A. between the treated and sham treated samples was due to the higher S.A. of the sham treated (Table 1) and not the CSC yield, since the yield of both sets of samplies are nearly equall (Table 2).

We experienced continued slight SOM and SOFP softness related to increased retail presence on Marlboro, continued high  levels of competitive Branded Savings discounting, and less aggressive discounting activity than anticipated on our own key FP brands.  RJR’s Savings business stayed on trend from March to April, with slight growth on DORAL partially offsetting continued softness on MONARCH and BEST VALUE.  Outlook:  We don’t expect to see any change in our FP performance in May. We have no national workplan activities on CAMEL/SELECT for May and we'll continue to be impacted by the same competitive factors that contributed in April.  Our Savings business in total will also likely remain somewhat soft, but DORAL is expected to gain share in May as retail support (BSGSF) increases.  Given the MARLIN audit schedule for the May period, retail data for May is expected to show little, if any, impact from the PM product recall.

To: From:  Subject:  EXHIBIT 5. PHILIP MORRIS INCORPORATED  VHTER-OFFICE CORRESPOHDERCE  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Mr. L. F. Meyer bate: December 4, 1980  Warren Claflin, Cliff Liny, Borer Martin  "Percent Tar Free"! Claim On Cigarettes  A recently developed line of marketing strategy for low delivery cigarettes. has been to claim the brand as being " percent tar free," as opposed to using conventional FTC tar values. In an article in Fortune (Page 121, November 17, 1980), Brown and Williamson explained that "percent tar free" was derived by dividing the weight of tar in a puff by the total weight of all material in a puff, including the dilution air and the smoke stream. The smoke stream differs from the dilution air because of the particulate phase and enhanced quantities of the major combustion gases (carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide). Cigarette dilution combines an air stream with the smoke stream in a given proportion by volume and passes the resultant nicotine through a cellulose acetate  filter to remove a fraction of the tar, nicotine, and water.  The fraction of each component removed.is different and depends on the specific filter efficiency. The volume percent of the gaseous components in the stream is not significantly changed by the filtration because the particulate phase occupies such a small percentage by volume. An air particulate stream that is, a 90-10% ratio by weight is a 99.9-0.1% ratio by volume, ° because of the large differences in density between the gases and solids. oo .  The weight percent of the smoke stream was evaluated using the data presented by Baker at the 1980 TCRC meeting in Richmond, Virginia and is shown in Column 3 of Table 1. These numbers are in good agreement with previous results of M. E. Hobbs, Invited Paper, CORESTA/TCRC, Williamsburg, Va. 1972. Combining | these values with known molecular weights (Table 1, Column 2), the volume percent composition of the stream is evaluated and is shown in Column 4 of Table 1. This smoke stream is then combined with the dilution air stream in a. volume ratio (100-D):D, where D is the cigarette dilution, to give the results shown in Column 6 of Table 1. The volume percent of tar, nicotine and water deliveries to the smoker has been assumed to be zero and is certainly less than 1% for high dilution cigarettes. The actual volume percent of tar cannot be calculated without knowing the filtration efficiency of the filter for the particulate phase, whereas the gas stream composition is unaffected on passing through the filter. The values in Column 7 of Table 1 are derived | by two different methods. The tar weight is the value derived experimentally by weighing the Cambridge pads from FTC smoking and subtracting nicotine and water. Nicotine and water weights are derived by extraction techniques on the Cambridge pad.  2042790056 __label__Memo

Chromosome Rearrangements and DNA Repair Preliminary Proposal George Weinstock, Ph.D.  Summary  Research in my laboratory has been concerned with DNA repair and recombination. For the past several years we have been studying unequal crossing over (UCO) or ectopic recombination. UCO is the recombination that occurs between repeated sequences that align out of register with the rest of the chromosome. This type of recombination leads to chromosome rearrangements such as duplications, deletions, inversions and translocations. Moreover, UCO is stimulated by DNA damage. The purpose of the proposed research is to:  1 Continue studies in E. coli to understand the mechanism of UCO and develop an assay for UCO that will allow us to investigate this phenomena in all organisms.  2. Use this assay to investigate UCO in eukaryotic cells and determine the effect of DNA damaging treatments, DNA repair systems, ageing, and other factors.  Background  UCO is recombination between repeated sequences that gives rise to duplications, deletions, inversions, and chromosome translocations. In man these types of rearrangements are associated with a variety of diseases. On the X chromosome alone, examples of diseases resulting from rearrangements causing deletions are Kallmann syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Goltz syndrome, X-linked xeroderma pigmentosum. An example of a duplication and a deletion that occur between the same repeated sequences is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, caused by the duplication, and HNPP syndrome, in which case the same region is deleted. There are, of course, other examples of less severe diseases that are caused by rearrangements on the X chromosome, perhaps most notable being the variations in color vision caused by recombination between tandemly repeated opsin genes. The effects on color discrimination point out another consequence of UCO; namely that hybrid sequences are formed. In the case of color vision, recombination between these slightly different opsin genes leads to new hybrid genes with altered spectral sensitivities. In addition, numerous examples of rearrangements on the other human chromosomes have been related to disease. It is anticipated that many human disorders will be ultimately related to these types of chromosome rearrangements. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which rearrangements occur and developing more sensitive assays for detecting rearrangements is important to the molecular medicine of the future.  Our laboratory has studied UCO in E. coli. Our use of this bacteria as a model  system was mainly prompted by its ease of genetic manipulation. However, UCO is also important in bacterial pathogenesis. For example, Vibrio cholera amplifies the  50619005 __label__Scientific

Cassette  recorders up 150%  Sales expected to hit $350 million in 1970; tape volume also soars  Time was when only a relatively few Americans owned tape Tre- corders. Most of them were the “hi- fi hobbyists. who were willing to put up with the need for threading tape from one reel to another... with the agony of watching tape come spilling out of the machinery in wild disarray because of some malfunction.  The dedicated hi-fi aficionados stil], for the most part, stay with their open-reel machines. But mil- lions of the more fumble-fingered public have come into the tape re- corder market, as a result of the ad- yent of the cassette—the self-con- tained unit in which tape moves from one reel to the other without need for the user ever to touch the reel or the tape.  So papular, so ubiquitous has the cassette recorder become that indus- try leaders estimate U. S. retail vol- ume will reach $350 million in 1970. This would represent an increase of more than 150% over 1969.  AMERICAN DRUGGIST'’S most re- cent big ticket survey indicated that more than 16,000 drug stores car- ried cassette recorders.  Nor is the business limited to the recording devices. A cassette re- corder is of no use without cassette tape—and sales of blank tape are expected to exceed $80 million this year.  While no one knows for sure— because the market is still in its for- mative stages—what percentage of the business is done by drug stores, guesses by those in the field vary from 151% to 17%.

LEITMAN.* Victoria L. AGNOST., Jessie J. TUAN. Jeffrey W. ANDRESEN and Ferid MURAD Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, Stanford University School of Medicine. Veterans Administration Medical Center  (111), 3801 Miranda Avenue. Palo Alto, CA 94304, U.S.A.  We used cultured rat lung fibroblasts to evaluate the role of particulate and soluble guanylate cyclase in the atrial riatriuretic factor (ANF)-induced stimulation of cyclic GMP. ANF receptors were identified by binding of 1®1-ANF to confluent cells at 37°C. Specific ANF binding was rapid and saturable with increasing concentrations of ANF. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Ky) was 0.66 + 0.077 nm and the Bingx. WAS 216+ 33 fmol bound/10° ceils, which corresponds to 130000 + 20000 sites/cell. The molecular characteristics of ANF binding sites were examined by affinity cross-linking of '?°|-ANF to intact cells with disuccinimidyl suberate. ANF specifically labeled two sites with molecular sizes of 66 and 130 kDa, which we have identified in other cultured cells. ANF and sodium nitroprusside produced a time- and concentration- dependent increase in intracellutar cyclic GMP. An inctease in cyclic GMP by ANF was detected at I mm, and at 100 nm an approx. 100-fold increase in cyclic GMP was observed. Nitroprusside stimulated cyclic GMP at 10 om and at 1 mm a 500-600-fold increase in cyclic GMP occurred. The simultaneous addition of 100 nM-ANF and 10 gm-nitroprusside to cells resulted in cyclic GMP levels that were additive. ANF increased the activity of particulate guanylate cyclase by about 10-fold, but had no effect on soluble guanylate cyclase. In contrast, nitroprusside did not alter the activity of particulate guanylate cyclase, but increased the activity of soluble guanylate cyclase by 17-fold. These results demonstrate that rat lung fibroblasts contain ANF receptors and suggest that the ANF-induced stimulation of cyclic GMP is  mediated entirely by particulate guanylate cyclase.     INTRODUCTION  Extracts and purified peptides derived from mamma- lian atrial tissue produce natriuresis and diuresis i vito (Cantin & Genest, 1985; Laragh, 1985; Balermann & Brenner, 1985; Needleman & Greenwald, 1986). Because of their renal effects these peptides have been called atrial natriuretic factors (ANF). However, recently it has become clear that ANF also acts on tissues other than the kidney to regulate blood pressure and intravascular volume. ANF has been shown to produce vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Winquist er ai., 1984), decrease cardiac output (Volpe er a/., 1986) and inhibit aldosterone (De Lean ez al., 1984), renin (Burnett er ai., 1984: Kurtz et al,, 1986) and vasopressin (Samson, 1985) secretion. In addition, ANF has been shown to inhibit water and saline, intake after central administration of ANF (Antunes- Rodrigues et a/., 1985, 1986), The relative contribution of each of these effects of ANF to the overall role of ANF in blood pressure and volume homoeostasis ts unclear.  Specific receptors for ANF have been identified in membranes from aorta (Napier e? ail., 1984), adrenal cortex (De Lean et al., 1984) and brain (Quition ef ai.. 1986) and in cultured smooth muscle (Hirata e7 a/., 1984: Leitman et ai., 1985: Schenk ef af, 1985), endothelial (Schenk ef a/., 1985, Leitman & Murad, 1986) and        kidney (Ballermann er ai., 1985) cells. Binding of ANF to its receptors is associated with increased activity of particulate guanylate cyclase (Winquist ef a/., 1984; Waldman er ai., 1984, 1985; Tremblay et a/., 1985). elevated cyclic GMP (Winquist er a/., 1984; for review see Leitman & Murad. 1987) and in some tissues an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (Anand-Sriva- stava et al., 1984). Our laboratory has been using ANF as a pharmacological probe to clucidate the mechanism whereby hormones and other agents activate guanylate cyclase and increase intracellular cyclic GMP. Waldman and coworkers previously showed that ANF activated the particulate form of guanylate cyclase, but not the soluble form in a number of rat tissues (Winguist er ai., 1984; Waldman e7 ai., 1984, 1985). However, because it has not been possible to activate the soluble enzyme by hormones or neurotransmitters in cell-free systems, ANF may also elevate cyclic GMP in intact cells by activating the soluble enzyme. To explore further the role of particulate and soluble guanylate cyclase in the ANF- induced stimulation of cyclic GMP, we have compared the effects of ANF and sodium nitroprusside on cyclic GMP accumulation and guanylate cyclase activity in cultured rat lung fibroblasts. In this study, we have identified ANF receptors in cultured rat iung fibroblasts. Furthermore, our results suggest that the increase in cyclic GMP by ANF is mediated entirely by particulate  Abbrevianons used: ANF. ainal natriureuc factor, DMEM.

In order to accomplish this, we are assembling a special New York City Task Force, which will work full time on this: important effort for at least the next 90 days. The Task Force will be situated in the large ninth floor conference room and will serve as the nerve: center of the company's effort to: defeat the Mayor's anti-smoking efforts. The: Task Force will consist of  professional and clerical personnel, drawn. from throughout the corporation for  temporary duty. The Task Force will. operate: in liaison with the PM U.S.A. Corporate Affairs Department to ensure a coordinated, correct approach.  We very much need your assistance in forming this special Task Force. Because most of the activities of the Task Force center on coordination and logistics between myriad disciplines andi activities, we believe the Task Force Leader should be an individual with such experience.  Jeannine Dowling"s name immediately comes to mind. Her successful experience with two World Fairs: and! with her current duties indicate she is the best choice.  Consequently, we would’ respectfully request that Ms. Dowling be temporarily assigned to PM U.S.A. Corporate: Affairs, for a period of 90 days, in order to be the Task Force Leader of the New York City Task Force. All salary and expenses will be assumed by PM! U.S.A. for the assignment period. If you: agree, we would’ like: to have the Task Force leader in place by April 2, 1986. Many thanks. cof RECEIVED cc: H. Maxwell , J. A. Murphy {98 H. Cullman APR 1 F.  S285202  6E9  - E..

23, FELDMAN, PIERCE, MoauLlS?sd  INTEROFFICE MEMO  DATE: December 28, 1994  TO: Don Ford, Ph.D.  FROM: Henry T. Lynch, M.D.  SUBJECT: Mark R. Green, M.D. #4148 "Lung Cancer: Tissue  Acquisition and Molecular Analysis" SECONDARY REVIEWER:  Dr. Green hypothesizes that heritable genetic characteristics are important in conferring variable susceptibility to the initiation and promotion of lung cancer. Should a molecular genetic foundation for this hypothesis be found, it could then provide elucidation with respect to the evolution of lung cancer. This would then have implications for early detection, therapy, and possibly even prevention through identifying high-risk individuals. Such a molecular genetic loci could also enable the determination of genetic targets for environmental carcinogens within the lung. This could involve chemoprevention.  Dr. Green will attempt to identify genetic components which may play an etiologic role in the transition of normal lung tissue to lung cancer. This will involve differential mRNA Display PCR (mRNA "fingerprinting") (DDP) and Representational Difference analysis (RDA) which are recently developed molecular techniques which have promise in terms of permitting rapid identification of molecular variances at the genomic and transitional level between neoplastic and normal tissue counterparts. These methodologies will be employed in Dr. Green's grant.  It is anticipated that between 25 to 40 patients per year will be recruited, at which time blood draws and tissue procurement will be attained. These patients will be interviewed and seen in the Multi-Disciplinary Second Opinion Lung Cancer Clinic. This interview will include their smoking history.  The aims will include the mentioned molecular genetic methodologies which, if successful, may be able to address the P.I.'s hypothesis. With some degree of optimism, this could then translate into the clinic.  This is a well thought-out study which is based on methodologies at the cutting edge of molecular biology. The patient and specimen collection should be readily facilitated in that Dr. Green is the Director of the Program for Lung Cancer Research and Head of the Lung Cancer Clinical Research Program at the UCSD Cancer Center. This is a highly pertinent study.  Merit A.  CTR-CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO P.O. IN US v. PM ETAL. 99CV2496 (SCIENTIFIC PEER-REVIEW MATERIAL) __label__Scientific

Total 9 packs out of one carton were collected from that retailer.  A few month ago, there was an incident on the news that some forgery tobacco (JT brand) which illegally imported from China were found by consumer who bought cigarettes from a retailer. Since them, consumer as well as retailer are quite nervous about the product.  We believe that this is isolated incident as no other complaints are reported. However, please kindly inspect the sample and answer to the following questions.  1. Is it a genuine PM products? 2. If yes, which region was it suppose to be exported? 3. Is there any possibility that it can be misplaced in the Japan Domestic products?  One sample pack is being sent to you via TNT AWB# 228750764 for your inspection and the remaining 8 packs are being sent to you under JPQ# 39146 by BPC.  Your early reply would be highly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.  Best regards,  Kayoko Sonoda  Import Administration & Logistics Philip Morris K.K. 81-3-3509-7353 (Tel) §1-3-3506-7737 (Fax)  a9e06Z91802 __label__Email

AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, INC.  219 EAST 42N0 STRHOET + NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017 © (212) 867-3709  RESEARCH EDUCATION SERVICE  WILLIAM B. LEWIS CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF OIRECTORG  April 17, 1970  Mr. Joseph F. Cullman, 3rd Chairman of the Executive Committee The Tobacco Institute, Inc.  Philip Morris, Inc.  100 Park Avenue  New York, New York 10017  Dear Mr. Cullman:  The Veterans Administration, the American Cancer Society and Doctors Auerbach and Hammond cannot accede to the requests stated in your letter of February 27 and March 20 for an evaluation of the Auerbach-Hammond study on “The Effects of Cigarette Smoking Upon Dogs” by a panel of independent scientists chosen by you.  Your request is without precedent in the scientific community. The study under question was the result of three and a half years of diligent and brilliant work by two eminently qualified scientists whose findings have been validated by distinguished pathologists of worldwide reputation. In addition, other leading pathologists, highly regarded by the scientific community, have visited Dr. Auerbach’s laboratory, seen his slides and praised the work.  We do not intend to ask that these two eminent men submit their findings to any selected committee chosen by the Tobacco Institute, or any other group. Their work will be judged in the traditional manner of American science, where findings are presented, discussed, accepted or rejected by scientists and physicians whose only motivation is the truth. Doctors Auerbach and Hammond worked freely and without restraint with funds furnished by the federal government and the American Cancer Society. They are beholden only to the scientific community at large and to the integrity it represents.  If the Tobacco Institute, or any scientific research group, has doubts about the findings of this study, the way it was conducted, or the credentials of the investigators, there is a time-honored and scientifically accepted way to proceed. Let your own or another group of scientists repeat the | experiments in a laboratory to prove that smoking dogs will not suffer tissue damage, emphysema and lung cancer. The Auerbach-Hammond methodology is readily available to you. And I presume that in the Council for Tobacco Research you have or can set up the mechanism for conducting such a study.  If you carry out your plan to publicize “our respective positions” to the medical and lay public, you have our permission to use this letter as the position paper of the American Cancer Society.

-63- Schoendorf and Kiely (1992)  The first study to independently examine maternal smoking during and after pregnancy  - was published by Schoendorf and Kiely (1992). They performed a case-control analysis of data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Within this dataset, 201 black and 234 white autopsied SIDS cases were identified from death certificates; approximately 3,000 controls for each race were used. The analysis was restricted to infants weighing >2,500 grams at birth. Mothers were questioned regarding their level of cigarette consumption during pregnancy and at the time of interview, and from their responses categorized as nonsmokers, smokers after pregnancy only, or smokers during and after pregnancy. After adjustment for maternal age, education, and marital status, maternal smoking only after pregnancy had an OR of 1.8 (CI 1.0, 3.0) for whites and 2.3 (C1 =1.5, 3.7) for blacks. The risk of SIDS among infants of women who smoked both during and after pregnancy was 3.1 (CI =2.3, 4.2) and 3.1 (CI =2.2, 4.3) for whites and blacks respectively. The ORs for “passive” (postnatal) and “combined” (pre- and postnatal) exposure were not directly comparable, as mothers who smoked during and after pregnancy tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than mothers who smoked only after pregnancy. The authors also examined the risk of SIDS in relation to the presence of other smokers in the household. In whites, household smoking was significantly associated with SIDS (OR=1.4, CI=1.0, 1.9), but no relationship was seen in blacks (OR=0.9, CI 0.7, 1.3). This latter analysis controlled for mother's smoking status only.  Mitchell et al, (1993)  Final results from the New Zealand case-control study were published in Mitchell ef al. (1993). The study's catchment area covered 78% of all live births in New Zealand during the 3-year study period. Four hundred eighty-five SIDS cases were compared to 1,800 controls. Case infants were much more likely than were control infants to have mothers who had smoked in the two weeks prior to interview (OR=4.1, CI=3.3, 5.1). The OR decreased to 1.7 (CI=1.2, 2.3) but was still significant at the p=0.05 level after adjusting  for: region, season, breastfeeding, and bed sharing; mother's marital status, socioeconomic  EXTERNAL REVIEW DRAFT MARCH 1995  | | SA6ZSVELSOS |  { ‘ __label__Scientific

OVERVIEW: TEENAGE SMOKING ISSUE AND PROGRAM  The Issue     Most simply stated, the “teenage smoking” issue involves the  accusation that cigarette companies use sophisticated marketing  techniques to tempt youngsters to smoke; that children who enjoy  smoking are likely to continue and, as time goes by, may have  difficulty quitting. Ultimately, it is then argued, the years of  an: Though the accusation is flawed in many ways, our critics use  it regularly with good effect. It is used as a.rationale for labeling and sampling legislation and as an argument for  prevention of use of live models in cigarette brand advertising.  It was prominent among the reasons why cigarette companies no  longer advertise on radio and television.  The industry's response has: been clear but passive. In  a  publications, advertising, testimony and in other public  appearances, Institute representatives regularly state that  siioking is a matter for informed, adult choice.  An Advertising Code, aimed at discouraging promotion to children, was adopted in 1965 though the voluntary agency charged  with monitoring adherence to the code was disbanded earlier this  year after several years of inactivity.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: D. B. Losee. Date: January 10, 1991 From: W.R. Raymond Subject: Weekly Summary, Project 2702, Week of 1/7/90  Single-Blade Carbon Heater Evaluation:  Evaluation has begun of the first 4-blade constant contact pressure fixture. prototype from Laser Mechanical. A manual switch has been installed for heater switching. This first prototype fixture was manufactured from MACOR. A second PEEK fixture is expected tomorrow. If prototype evaluations are successful, five more PEEK fixtures.will be fabricated.  Tobacco Substrate Studies:  Bright and burley dust samples are. being separated’ by mesh size (100 to <270' mesh). These samples will be used to prepare cast sheets to determine. the effect of particle size on sheet integrity and subjective character.  IR camera studies of glassy carbon heaters, coated with cast tobacco sheet using: Konjac flour as the adhesive, demonstrated that adhesion was maintained at heater temperatures up to 409 ° C. Continued modifications are being made to the binder system to increase the temperature threshold for adhesion failure. Samples of Konjac flour have been: submitted to Dr. Carchman for pyrolysis GC/MS analysis (300, 600 and 900° C).  MT Oriental’ strip has been cut and adhered to carbon: heater strips for baseline subjective evaluation. Two different high flavor, high alkaloid blend dusts (ca. 200 mesh): have been received from Flavor Development. These samples will be. sieved to separate into discreet mesh sizes for cast sheet preparation and subjective screening.  Miscellaneous:  The Karl Fischer titrator has been set up and is operational, permitting accurate moisture determination on heaters, cast sheets. and tobacco dust samples.  Assistance was provided to the Materials group to coat screen-printed ceramic heater prototypes with tobacco sheet for thermal evaluation. A calcium crosslinked Konjac flour adhesive system resisted sheet/heater delamination at temperatures >400:'° C'as measured by thermocouple (estimated >450 ° C actual). Further studies will be conducted to determine the surface properties of the screen-printed heaters.  A meeting was held with Bill Bell, Marshall Garrett and Bob Hale of Flavor Development to begin. consideration of flavor system development for the RTX prototype. Based on their initial subjective evaluation of prototypes containing Burley and Flue-Cured sheets, Bell! and Garrett are selecting flavor ingredients for subjective screenings beginning next week.

noo Original Message----- From: Haussmann, Hans J. Sent: Wednesday, August 25, 1999 11:17 AM i To: Koller, Debbie  Cc: Hempiiling, Walter, Nixon, Gerry M. Subject: Endotoxin in smoke  Dear Debbie:  At the meeting with Ragnar Rylander on Aug. 24, 1999, we discussed the endotoxin issue. Please find attached a draft concept on a pilot study to qualitatively and quantitatively ascertain the claimed endotoxin delivery to cigarette mainstream smoke.  Ragnar has the LAL assay established in his laboratory in a version that allows the distinction of the endotoxin- and glucan-induced LAL response. He would also be willing to do the tests once Walter has the material available to do the comparison of unwashed and washed samples.  We further discussed the potential bioassay to determine the biological effect of the washing. Normally, the response to endotoxin inhalation is the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in the bronchoalveolar space. We found this effect in the bronchoalveolar lavage of rats exposed to mainstream smoke at concentrations of 100 ug total particulate matterA or higher. Thus, we think the required biological assay would be at hand at INBIFO/CRC. The question to be tested would be whether the washing would shift the threshold for the PMNL influx to higher smoke concentrations. Thus, we would probably use three smoke concentrations for each type of cigarette. The inhalation period would be 21 days. With approximately 1500 cigarettes per group and day and some spare cigarettes to test the setup, we would need approximately 110.000 cigarettes per type for a full-blown biological analysis.  | would appreciate your thoughts on that process. If you agree, we then would need to pass the concept for the pilot study through the concept review board for INBIFO/CRC projects.

Lorillard  MEMORANDUM TO: ALL EMPLOYEES! FROM: A.W. Spears DATE: July 23, 1998 RE: Significant Legal Developments  Tam writing to inform you of two significant developments which I believe could impact favorably upon the company’s position in ongoing litigation concerning tobacco and health.  On July 16, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed a class certification order entered by a trial judge, and ordered that plaintiffs’ claims be dismissed in their entirety. The trial judge had certified a class consisting of New York residents who purchased and smoked cigarettes since 1980, The Appeals Court ruling emphatically rejected the certification order on the grounds that individual issues of proof would predominate the proceedings and that the class would be unmanageable. The Court pointed out that because the tobacco companies have a Constitutional right to cross-examine each class member, the trial  “would take hundreds of years.”  This ruling is significant in that it represents the first time that a state appellate court has rejected class certification on these grounds and followed the logic of similar favorable rulings by federal court judges throughout the country. We are hopeful that other state judges will be guided by this influential court and adopt its clear and reasoned approach to class actions pending in various state courts.  In another meaningful decision, a federal judge here in Greensboro, Judge William Osteen, ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s classification of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) as a “Group A carcinogen” was wrong as a matter of law and fact. Judge Osteen found that the EPA did not follow the well-founded rules of procedure it was required to and improperly adjusted established scientific procedures to validate the agency’s predetermined conclusions. The Judge made it clear that had EPA followed such rules, it might have reached a  different conclusion.  This opinion is important in that it validates our long-held view that ETS has not been scientifically proven to cause cancer or other diseases in non-smokers. We also believe that this decision will make it more difficult for states and localities to justify draconian smoking restrictions in public places like restaurants and bars.  We are encouraged that these courts have applied the law in a fair and even-handed manner in the. face of unprecedented assaults on our business. I will continue to keep you apprised of other such developments. :  2L67S918 __label__Memo

Immunoglobulin E Receptor Cross-linking Induces Oscillations in Intracellular Free Ionized Calcium in Individual Tumor Mast Cells*  ‘Received for publication, June 5, 1989)  Paul J. Millardt§, Timothy A. Ryan, Watt W. Webbj, and Clare Fewtrellt From the {Department of Pharmacology, WDepartment of Physics, and the | School of Applied and Engineering Physics,  Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853  Fura-2 fluorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia cells was monitored to study the rise in intracellular free ionized calcium ([Ca*]) produced by aggregation of immunoglobulin E receptors. Repetitive transient increases in (Ca**],; were induced by antigen stimula- tion and were measured using digital video imaging microscopy at high time resolution. The {Ca?*], oseil- lations were not dependent upon changes in the mem- brane potential of the cells and were observed in cells stimulated with antigen either with or without extra- cellular Ca**. Transient oscillations in [Ca2*]; were also observed when calcium influx was blocked with La®*. These results suggested that during antigen stimula- tion of cells under normal physiological conditions, release of Ca** from intracellular stores makes an im- portant contribution to the initial increase in [Ca?*},, Oscillations in [Ca?*]; are not induced by elevating [Ca’*], with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mito- chondrial calcium buffering is not required for [Ca?*], oscillations to occur. The results show that rat baso- philic leukemia cells have significant stores of calcium and that release of calcium from these stores can par-  ticipate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in [Ca**],.  rr rr  Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)' cells are a tumor mast cell line that responds to stimuli that aggregate surface receptors for immunoglobulin E (IgE), generating a large rise in intra- cellular free ionized calcium ({Ca**],) and ultimately resulting in secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. It has long been known that Ca** plays a critical role in the  initiation and control of secretory behavior in many different eee  * This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grants DCB 8702584, DIR 8716854 (to C.

Furthermore, studies in mast cells using Ca’* ionophores have established a causal relationship between the increase in [Ca**], and secretion (1, 2). Changes in (Ca?*], in RBL cells have largely been attributed to the influx of Ca2* from the extracellular medium (3-6). However, the involve- ment of releasable calcium stores in the control of cellular processes has been documented in many cell types, and cal- cium stores have recently been implicated in the generation of elevated [Ca’*}, in RBL cells? (5, 7, 8). Indeed, stores are sufficient to supply enough calcium to support much of the early phase of the rise in [Ca], in these cells (5).  Digital video imaging of fluorescent indicators has been used to study changes in [Ca**], in a number of different cell types (9-18) including RBL cells (19). Current studies by us and by others have shown remarkable differences between the measurements of [Ca’*], in populations of cells and those obtained from the individual cells that comprise the popula- tion. In our early work (19), the [Ca?*]; responses of individual RBL cells stimulated by cross-linking surface IgE receptors were found to be preceded by lag times of variable length; once initiated, the rise in [Ca’*]; was much more rapid than might be predicted from fluorometric studies with cell suspen- sions. It has been observed that [Ca’*], in different types of cells stimulated with a variety of agonists fluctuates markedly (20), sometimes in concert with repetitive spiking of the membrane potential (21-24). Because of technical restrictions frequently associated with digital video microscopy, high time resolution measurements of [Ca’*]; have often been carried out using one cell at a time. Significant improvement of the temporal resolution of [Ca]; imaging measurements has allowed us to record simuitaneously the marked, frequently oscillating increases of [Ca’*], in many stimulated RBL cells.  In this study, we have begun to characterize the (Ca?*]; oscillations, to identify their source, and to determine what cellular components are involved in their control. We have found that oscillations in [Ca’*‘]; can still occur when the membrane potential is clamped and do not require calcium influx from the extracellular solution. The [Ca?"], oscillations  appear to occur as the result of modulation of [Ca**]; by exchange with intracellular stores.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell Preparation—Rat basophilic leukemia cells of the secreting subline 2H3 (25) were cultured as described previously (26). Cells were removed from flasks by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (GIBCO) in a calcium- and magnesium-free saline solution. Sensitization by incubation with a monoclonal IgE directed against the dinitrophenyl hapten was carried out in Eagle's minimal essential medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10 mM Na-HEPES and 20% newborn bovine serum (GIBCO).

UNEDITED TRANSLATION  RE: PRESENTATION BY PROFESSOR DR. SCHMAEHL IN BERLIN NOVEMBER 23, 1979 ,  Professor Schmaehl presented a lecture at the Berlin  meeting of Clinicians and: Otorhinolaringoflogic Specialists  on November 23, 1979, on the pathogenesis of malignant tu- mors in the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus and lung. There  is no doubt that the attending doctors were strongly moved  by the lecture. Prof. Schmachl knew how to present the relationships in a short period and illuminating manner, whereby the presentation was less scientific and more designed for a continuous education for the participatns. -In discussing the subject, Prof. Schmaeh] raturally included the problem of smoking and health. He presented the problem in a restrained ‘manner which is worth noticing. He emphasized the following:  1. Smoking is one risk factor among many and it is exclusively up to the smoker to decide whether he is willing to take the risk associated with smoking.  2. The introduction of filter cigarettes reduced very significantly the risk of smoking. It is possible that further progress in cigarette manufacture will lower. the risk still further. ,  3. The idea advanced by Prof. Oeser, that cancer deaths are "fate", may be correct. However, this concept can hardly satisfy a scientist. More so, because of the evidence oY the possibility of cancer induction in animal experiments and seemingly also in humans of every age group with chemical substances and environ-  mental factors.  4. There are no indications that certain psychological dispositions play a role in carcinogenesis, the opposite  may rather be the case.  5, The presentation lasted about 45 minutes, the subject of smokinr was dealt with for about five to ten minutes. The short .ime used for this subject should have created the impression that today's smoking can not be so dangerous.  November 27, 1979 Dr. F, Adlkofer     S@ZL Leoos __label__Report

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia’ RECEIVED  1S MANAGEMENT CORP. ee RT PATENT SECTION  To: Distribution JUN 44 4988 Date: June 13, 1988  From: Cliff Lilly     NOTED  Subject: Proposal for Professor Richard Zallen to Study Sol-Gel Process for Coatings  Attached is a proposal which I solicited from Dr. Dick Zallen of VPI- Physics to study coatings and films by the Sol-Gel process. It is intended that Dr. Andy Kallianos will work in Dr. Zallen’s lab in an effort to make uniform Sol-Gel coatings of oxides and refractory coatings in paper fibers. The objective of the work is to develop a PM process for refractory papers which are badly needed for the sidestream and Delta programs.  The proposal is a modest one but I have great confidence in Dr. Zallen’s scientific ability in this area. I strongly recommend we support this effort. This work did not apear on the 1988 eoriginial budget but can be supported out of the unused Visiting Scientist budget.  Please let me have your comments on this proposal.

RECEIVED CONFIDENTIAL | JAN 28 1988-~  _ /  MEMORANDUM TO: J. T. Winebrenner / iw  nuary 27, 1988 G. BR Di MARCO        SUBJECT: The Archer Company - of January 25, 1988  eekly Activity Report for Week  1. Genesis Packaging - TAC's peelable retortable lidding structure is the material of choice at Genesis, who requested 3MM square inches for further machine evaluations. Genesis has sold two machines for applying our flexible membranes to their plastic barrier containers and retorting products to replace metal cans. One machine is at National Food Laboratories; the other machine's location is confidential. Genesis and TAC management will meet during the second quarter to coordinate efforts geared for production quantities early 1989,  2. Polaroid - A management/technical team from Polaroid is visiting TAC 1/26-27/88 to review the technical issues on modifying their structure for one mil pod foil to enable TAC to receive a 500% permanent increase in business. One mil pod is presently produced on a unique multi-faustel laminator that is already at capacity and Polaroid desires to have the new structure approved by 10/1/88. Both companies are working to make the opportunity happen.  3. Campbell (Plastigon Program - Retortable Soups) - TAC's lidding material (utilizing a proprietary sealant film produced on the oriented film line at the pilot plant) has just passed U.S.D.A. protocol testing. Material to be tested at their Maxton, NC plant this week. The Plastigon program will leapfrog Campbell into new technology and markets.  4. Miles Laboratories - After three price negotiation sessions, we have still not resolved our 1/1/88 price. Our cost increases justified a price increase proposal of 7.75%. Miles countered with an offer of 2.0%. We have countered with a 5.5% price increase for S4MM of business and a 5.0% increase for $5MM of business. We  expect to settle on the latter and and finalize this agreement by 1/29/88.  5. Converter Foil Pricing ~ Alcoa has announced a price increase of 6% to be effective on all new orders and on existing orders shipped after 4/18/88. We will support this increase and advise our customers that our prices have increased by 6% effective on and after 4/18/88. This action will also precipitate a general price increase on our foil-bearing converted products, and TAC Marketing will determine the level and timing of this increase.  6. TAC's Northeast Sales office has relocated from Long Island to  Wilton, Connecticut. Ralph Klein, Sales Manager, expects to have a secretary hired the week of 2/2/88.

Subject: Mail Kits for Personal Selling in FL  Date: Friday, January 10, 1997 8:24AM  Todd, do you know if any planning has taken place on the 97 mail kits for the two races in Florida where we will be doing personal selling?  Last year the Winston Kit was a letter about the race, and two coupons. Both expired 12/31/96 - one was for $3 off 4 packs or 1 carton, and the other was a B1GIF. Lindsay's group provided a paragraph about the race to Brenda Granderson in Consumer Relations and she incorporated the paragraph into a letter. The letter was actually run on legal-size paper, with the two coupons as tear-offs on the bottom of the letter. I have a sample of the paper, coupons, and cnyclope uscd. Included with the letter was a survey about future purchase intent.  Do you know who is in charge of planning for the mail kit this year? New coupons will have to be printed, and the survey may need to be revised.  Pls let me know. Thanks.  gZg¢g 622e¢  RJR1667071016 70000 7419 __label__Email
UNIVERSITY OF. VIRGINIA’ SS HEALTH  SCIENCES CENTER |  DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY         April 10, 1992 -  Harmon C. McAllister ; Research Director - mo,  The Council for Tobacco. Research-U. S.A. ‘Inc. 900 Third Avenue New York, NY 10022. .  Dear pe ier  For each of the past six years, the University of Virginia Cancer Center has sponsored a Fall Symposium on a topic in basic cancer research.: Past topics have included: Molecular Biology of  Human Cancer; Protein Phosphorylation; The Ras Superfamily; Viruses, Oncogenes and Cancer; Gene  Regulation; and Signal Transduction. We wish to:thank you again for your financial contribution of last y year that helped make the 1991 meeting a great success.. For this coming fall, we are organizing: a symposium on Molecular Signalling and Cell Structure: Understanding the: molecular and structural basis for the transmission of regulatory information from membrane to nucleus-is among the central contemporary issues in molecular oncology and cell biology, and this symposium should help to coalesce emerging ideas on the topic. * G e  lio Participants include Thomas Pollard (Johns Hopkins), Thomas Stossel (Brigham and  Women’s Hospital), Timothy Springer (Rockefeller University), Thomas Leto (NIFH), Colin Hopkins - (MRC, England ), and Inder Verma (Salk Institute).  The topics to be discussed range from studies on cell structure and growth factor receptors. to the analysis of gene expression. We feel that this conference is particularly timely and will help - to focus on new ideas regarding cell-cell interactions, cell structure and cell signalling. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of the topic and the. outstanding quality of the scientific participants, we expect this symposium to be a major event in this rapidly developing field.  We are writing to ask your financial support for this symposium. Funds will be used to. partially offset the costs of travel and local expenses of the speakers. We would, of course. acknowledge your contributions in the program and in any advertisements for the Symposium which are prepared subsequent to receiving a commitment from you. In addition, if The Council for Tobacco Research scientists wish to attend the Symposium and engage in. discussions with the participants or if sales representatives from The Council for Tobacco Research would like to set up a display at the Symposium, they would be made most welcome.  We look forward to hearing from you, and to your support fora stimulating meeting. : 7  Sincerely,          bf L& oo Olen Michael J. Weber. . J.

PROJECT NUMBER: 2525 PROJECT TITLE: Paper and Tobacco Research  PROJECT LEADER PERIOD COVERED  G. H. Bokelman November, 1989  I.. SIDESTREAM REDUCEE ON (S. Baldwin, S. Tafur, G. Bokelman, J. Kang,  A.  G. Newell, P. Suiter and B. Rogers)  Objectives: (1) Prepare and evaluate, for reduction in sidestream smoke, paper handsheets that contain additives and/or inorganic fillers with different physical and chemical properties and (2) evaluate machine-made cigarettes containing cigarette papers produced at the University of Maine or by Kimberly-Clark.  Results: An U.S. patent application was filed which, among other claims, covered the use of KH,PO, on high basis weight cigarette  papers.  Sherry Baldwin and Gordon Bokelman visited Dr. Helena Chum, an expert on cellulose and biomass pyrolysis, at the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) in Golden, Colorado. Prior to the visit two samples, representing high basis weight cigarette paper with and without KH,PO, additive, had been submitted for preliminary analysis on the molecular beam mass spectrometer at SERI. The results indicated distinctive differences between the samples. This information may be useful in understanding how paper additives. affect subjective characteristics, as well as reduce sidestream. The speed and ease with which real-time analysis of pyrolysis products can be achieved in the SERI laboratory is most impressive. A memo was prepared which gives more details on this trip and also. includes a preliminary proposal for research to be conducted at. SERI by Dr.. Chum’s group (1).  Three high basis weight papers made at the U. of Maine and sized with different levels of KH,PO, were used to prepare handmade cigarettes for sidestream analyses. Optimal sidestream reduction was clearly a function of paper porosity. These models were designed to provide assistance for commercial development of a low sidestream paper by Kimberly-Clark.  The examination of a number of different chemical sizings on medium and high basis weight papers was continued. A soluble form of “ferric” pyrophosphate (probably mixed ferric and ferrous) has been, shown to be quite effective for reducing sidestream at relatively low levels (~3%). Problems with this sizing include a slight yellow color which is imparted to the paper and the production of a reddish ash. Further examination of other iron salts (mostly ferrous) is planned as well as investigation of the potential for double-wrapping to hide the problems with “ferric” pyrophosphate. Reduction of sidestream was also shown with tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, but at higher levels (7-8%) than the “ferric” form. High levels of MAP and DAP (13-17%) produced no significant sidestream reduction and gave very long static burn times. A combination of KH,citrate and KH,PO, gave very good sidestream reduction with a faster static burn time than KH,PO,  62     vEeTEoe9z07e __label__Scientific

INTER-OFFICE CORRE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592  To: Jim Kordenbrock DATE: May 17, 1994     FROM: Michelle Salzman / Rick Wilhelm SUBJECT: RX Management Materials -- Agency Development Brief.  The following outlines the information that is to be incorporated into the Management Materials for Project RX.  OVERVIEW  As the penny profit generated from sales of RX is less than those realized from the sale of full margin brands and, in some instances, deep discount brands, the focus of the “sell story" for RX will be one based on consumer demand for the product. In essence, consumer demand for RX will be so strong that retailers not carrying the product will be ata competitive disadvantage. To support this argument, key learnings from the RX Ad-pack research (such as purchase interest), as well as a few "memorable" consumer quotes from focus groups and onc-on-oncs, will be incorporated into the sales materials.  The actual sell in brochure should be a printed 4 page, 4 color piece that contains a pocket for introductory. allowance worksheets, pricing worksheets P.O.S. menu items etc.  4 R BROCHURE  The following details the clements which are to be included on the sales brochure in priority order:  1) RX Proposition  First and foremost, retailers must he educated as simply as possible as to what RX is all about. They musi clearly understand it's positioning as every bit a Marlboro that because its shorter costs less.  While retail pricing is obviously a critical element to the success of RX, the brand's desired absolute rctailpricing of RX should not be printed on the actual 4 color brochure. Instead, suggested retil pricing will be handled on a scparate worksheet insert so that Sales reps. can adjust pricing on un account by account basis (sec example)  2) Sell Story:  Involving and straight-forward copy that “sells” the retail trade on the strong consumer demand RX will generate and how important itis that he/she carry the product is the foundation of ths sites sheers and must be boldly communicated.  2024072051 __label__Memo
November 29, 1988  To: J. H. Reynolds, III Chairman, HRRC  From: T. A. Perfetti Flavor Division, PA&T  Re: Calcium and Silicon Entrainment Data on Carbonized Cotton Linter Sheet Material  The HRRC requested that calcium and silicon entrainment data be collected on cigarette samples prepared with carbonized cotton linter sheet. The test product, Sample G, contained 50% sheet material which had 60% by weight CaC03. (Sample G, see memo). Mr. R. T. White, Jr. has analyzed cigarettes with up to 30% total weight CaCO3 per cigarette (Samples A, B and F). Based on his anal- ysis, calcium in the ash for Sample G was 63, 751 + 2985 ug/cigarette, i.e. 4.434 times the level of calcium in the control (WINSTON KS). The silicon in the ash was 3122 g/cigarette for the test product (Sample G) and 3339 ug/ cigarette for WINSTON KS. Calcium entrained into the mainstream smoke for the test product G was at a level equal to WINSTON KS (0.02 1g/cigarette) and  silicon entrainment into mainstream smoke was 0.042 ug/cigarette versus 0.066 ug silicon/cigarette for WINSTON KS.  The results indicate that the majority of the calcium, from the CaC03 present in the carbonized cotton linter sheet, resides in the cigarette ash >99%. The amount of silicon in the ash is about equal to that found in WINSTON KS. The amount of calcium and silicon entrainment for the test product G was no greater than the control. All values for silicon were at or below the limit of detection for mainstream smoke at 0.05 ug/cigarette.  As a result of these tests, we request permission for use of carbonized cotton linter sheet material containing calcium carbonate in a blend of tobaccos of up to a level of 30 weight percent calcium (see Sample G).  : tt, fy omas A.

DOPAMINE.DOC Page? TALKING POINTS REGARDING STUDY IN NATURE |  Much media attention has been given to the story about smoking, an enzyme called monoamine oxidase B (MAO B), and a neurotransmitter called dopamine. The press reports say the study claims that smokers have a lower concentration of the MAO-B enzyme in their brains. The study claims that since the MAO-B enzyme breaks down dopamine, having a lower level of this enzyme presumably has the effect of giving smokers an "addictive high" resulting from higher levels of dopamine. The study's authors claim that this could explain why smoking is “addictive.”  There are important points which may not be clear to readers from these press reports.  It is unreasonable and illogical to equate dopamine with “addiction.". Dopamine release is found in a wide array of situations and events. Animals studies have shown that dopamine is released as a result of both positive and negative circumstances -- including painful or stressful situations that would certainly not create reinforcing or "addictive" behavior.  Dopamine release can be triggered by any important or emotional event -- whether it's pleasurable or painful stimulation. For example, hungry rats which are fed then release dopamine; and thirsty rats who get water release dopamine when they drink. But stressful or painful experiences -- such as an electric shock -- also  stimulate the release of dopamine.  If these animal studies reflect to some degree the human situation, then the same thing would hold true: dopamine release is stimulated by both pleasant and painful experiences -- whether it comes from seeing someone you're very happy to see, or dropping a heavy object on your foot.  Based on media reports about the dopamine study, it's impossible to tell whether the study reported was controlled for confounding variables -- such as diet, how much someone smokes, or how recently they smoked before the study. These variables would be critical in determining what role, if any, smoking might play in the reduction of dopamine. Aside from smoking, many other aspects of the lifestyles of smokers and non-smokers tend to be very different -- which introduces confounding variables into studies of differences between smokers and non-smokers.  The study's authors compare the effects of smoking to the effect of drugs such as heroin and cocaine, Although there are issues regarding the molecular affects of certain substances that we don't understand very well, it is obvious that there are clear behavioral differences between people who smoke and people who use drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Regardless of how you define addiction, cigarettes are clearly not in the same class as addictive, mind-altering drugs like heroine and cocaine. For example, smokers do not become intoxicated or suffer from black-outs. The fact that behaviors like smoking or drinking coffee may be difficult for some people to stop does not mean they are addictive. Any behavior you enjoy can be difficult to change -- depending on the individual and the situation. ,  Note: If someone wanted a reference to a published scientific article on this subject, our Legal or R&D Department could provide a citation.

CHANGES IN TRANSMURAL CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE IN MAN DURING HYPERVENTILATION }-?  By JOHN W. ECKSTEIN * anp WILLIAM K. HAMILTON  (From the Hemodynamic Laboratory, Cardiovascular Research Laboratories, Department of Internal Medicine, and the Division of Anesthesiolagy, Department of Surgery, State University of lowa College of Medicine, Lowa City, Towa)  (Submitted for publication April 28, 1958; accepted July 24, 1958)  We demonstrated that large amounts of blood shift from the forearm veins during hvperventila- tion (2). If this effect were generalized in the periphery of the body the volume of blood in the central venous reservoir might increase. An in- crease in pressure in the central veins would be evidence to support this suggestidn. The fall in peripheral venous pressure which occurs during hyperventilation (2, 3), howevet, implies that central venous pressure also decreases. This makes our thesis less attractive. Still, the trans- mural pressure (4), the net pressute acting to dis- tend the central veins, could increase during over- breathing if the pressure surrounding the veins Gntrapleural pressure) decreased more than did the pressure within them.  This study was undertaken to assess the nature and magnitude of changes in mean transmural central venous pressure during hyperventilation and to see whether the changes were consistent with our suggestion that blood shifts centrally  during overbreathing.  METHODS  Subjects were studied in the right lateral detubitus position with the right arm extended downward through an opening in the table. Changes in central venows pres- sure were measured with a needle in the antecubital vein of the dependent arm according to the method of Gaver and Sieker (5). Changes in intrapleural pres- Sure, measured as changes in esophageal pressure, were obtained by means of a small, open-ended, water-filled polycthylene tube The tip of this tube was placed in the lower third of the esophagus It is recognized that  1 Read in part by title at the Fiftieth Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Investigation in Atlantic City, N.

Heart  esophageal pressure is not identeal with intrapleural Pressure; however, changes in the two pressures tend to be parallel (6). Cherniak, Farhi, Armstrong and Proctor (6) observed that phasic deviations from this parallelism which did develop during spontaneous breath- ing resulted in intrapleiaral pressures which were con- sistently more negative than esophageal pressures. Fven during intermittent positive pressure breathing the mean intrapleural pressure was more negative than the mean esophageal pressure. Thus ovr recorded values fot transmural central venous pressure are tess than those which actually existed.  Central venous and esophageal pressures were meas- ured with Statham 0 to 5 cm. Hg strain gauges. The difference between these two pressures, the transmural central venous pressure, was measured with a Sanborn differential pressure transducer. The reference poimt for pressure was the midsternal line. End-expiratory CO, concentration was measured with a Liston-Becker co, analyzer and ventilation was monitored with a gas meter (7). All three pressure values and CQ, concentration were registered simultaneously with a Sanborn direct- writing osc ograph.  After resting values were obtained the subjects, mate medical students. were asked to hyperventilate with Maximal inspirations and passive exptrations. They were Prompted in order to keep ventilation above 25 L. per minute and to maintain a reduction of at Jeast 10 mm. He in end-expiratory CO, concentration. Overbreathing was continned until values hecame stable. The period of overbreathing usually exceeded two minutes. This pro- cedure was repeated in some experiments with 5 per cent CO, in the inspired gas. In some experiments over- breathing with S per cent CO, was repeated after the intravenous administration of 5 mg. of phentolamine methansulfonate (Regitine®).¢  Reported mean pressures were obtained by counting squares under the curves registered by electrical inte- gration of the output of the manometers. The sensitivity of the amplifying system was adjusted so that respira- tory changes in the electrically integrated pressure curves occupied at least 2 to 3 cm. on the recording paper. In most experiments I cm. vertica'ly on the recording paper was equal to 20 or $0 mm Hg. Pressures were read  to the nearest 0.5 mm. He. Statistical analysis of the data was done by the meth-  ods of Fisher (8). 4 Supplied by Ciba Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.  1537  PUBLICATIONS  10330336     011449 __label__Scientific

Wagener, M.D. 21 July 1992  Associate Professor of Pediatrics  University of Colorado Medical School Advisor, Coalition on Smoking OR Health and Asthma Education Technical Advisory Group American Lung Association  Introduction  Nearly 10,000,000 children less than five years of age living in: the United States are exposed involuntarily to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home.t @ Twenty-five percent of pregnant women continue to smoke throughout their . pregnancy. Although the overall rate of smoking in U.S. society has been decreasing during the two and one-half decades since the Surgeon General's report on the adverse effects of tobacco, the exposure risk to young children, particularly those living in low income or black families, remains at 50-60 percent. ee |  Involuntary exposure to ETS affects children in three different ways. First, pre- natal exposure potentially can have a marked impact on total body development including lung, brain, and size development. Additionally, premature delivery and spontaneous abortion are related to maternal smoking. Second, post-natally the growing child may have effects of ETS which impact on the heart, lungs, immune system, ears, brain, and even survival itself. Third, and possibly most important, childhood exposure to ETS impacts on the child's decision to engage in active smoking and other self-injurious medical behaviors 2 which most likely will continue into adulthood and will compound the effects of perinatal ETS exposure.  Non-Respiratory Effects  The potentially injurious effects of ETS on a child's health are both non- respiratory and respiratory. Although the recently described correlation between ETS | and blood cholesterol in children is significant 3, the non-respiratory effect that may be  © most important is the relationship between ETS and sudden infant death syndromes - or SIDS - because mortality from SIDS during childhood is potentially preventible.  £O9T ETSOS  The University of Colorado is an equal opportunity ¢ affirmative action employer __label__Letter

The President had asked Mrs,. Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. to set up the committee after a’ group of California Congress- men had come to him with their: smog troubles.  The proposed $25,000,000 atudy would be much broader in. scope than one proposed in the bill for 2 $3,000,000 study, spon- sored by Senator Thomas H.| Kuchel, Republican of California. | This bill hag passed the Senate: and now is pending in the House j of Representatives. :  Closer to this plan is the smog bill sponsored by Senator Homer, E. Capehart, Republican of In-; diana, which set no ceiling on: appropriations for a broad-scale air pollution study. This bill also has passed the Senate, as a rider on the housing bill, .

Permanent Group Urged  The committee recommended that the proposed anti-pollution program be administered by the  partment of Health, Educa- tion and Welfare with the assistance of 2 permanent inter- departmental committee repre- senting the departments and agencies that participated in the ad hoe deliberations.  It defined “community air pol- lution,” a term coined in distine- tion to industrial-site air pollu. tion and atomic fall-out as: “The presence in the ambient atmosphere of substances put there by the activities of man in concentrations sufficient to in- terfere directly or indirectly with his comfort, ‘safety or health, or with full use and en- Joyment of his property.”  The report specifically stated: “In general, it does not refer to the atmospheric pollution inci- dent to employment in areas where workers are employed, nor is it concerned with airborne agents of communicable disease, nor with overt or coverts acts of war.”  The responsibilities of the states and localities and of the Federa? Government in coping with this modern problem atso were defined by the committee.  Regulatory control of com- munity air pollution, its report stated, is the province of state and local governments, except with regard to radioactive air pollution resulting from opera- tions directly controlled by the Federal Government or inter-, State and international air pol- lution,  However, the report also} stated, the Federal Government should provide supplementary Support and assistance to state, local and other agencies includ-| ing private organizations in technical and operational Brab- lems or situations beyond their| cence ‘This ts the helpful role; en y the proposed $25,-| 000,000 program. .

NOTEBOOK  Qua     DAY BULLETIN  ing record  in jeopardy today  By Louls Brewster Staff Writer  FONTANA — Ifthe rain Holds offtoday, chances are the qualify- ing record for the NASCAR Crafts- man Truck Series will fall at Cali- fornia Speedway.  Seven drivers unofficially bet- tered. the existing mark Thursday afternoon in a practice session; led by Kurt Busch in a Ford. His run of 177848 mph in 40.484 seconds topped the 173.561 mph, 41.484 lap of Andy Houston last:year that won the pole.  Houston, who will move into the NASCAR Winston Cup Series along with Busch next year, was second fastest. He. pushed his Chevrolet around the track in 41.045 seconds at 175.417 mph:  Others. who went faster than Houston’s record were Dennis Set- zer and-David Starr, the fastest of the Dodges, and the Fords driven by Mike Wallace, Greg Biffle and  _ Rick Crawford.  “Our strategy is to finish second in points,” said Busch, who's bat- thing for the spot along with Hous- ton and Wallace. “We are planning to stay as close to the front as we can and put a conservative setup on it where we can be comfortable in the draft.  “Then we will just work on hang: ing oat with the No. 60 (Houston) and No. 2. (Wallace) trucks.”,  Houston said his’ team made a mock run at the pole.  “The truck is running pretty well,” said Houston, who's won the last two NCTS poles at Fontana. “I think we have a real good shot at  trying to sit on the pole. This being  my last truck race, it would be good  _to goouta winner.” .  ORIVER INJURED: Rick Ware hit the “wail in tum two. during practice and. was transported to Loma Linda Uniwersity' Med- gai Center after treatment in the infield fa- city.  The Sportsman Racing Products owner driver, whe posted a fast time of 44.330 sec- onds and 162.418 mph, was to be held overnight for observation and additional tests.  IN MEMORY: All of the entries for the  NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Mo- torola 200 will-carry decals in memory of Torly Roper, who-died Oct, 13 as the re- sult of injuries sufiérecin a crash-at Texas Motor Speedway.”  The decals, are being distributed by the Busch Series Ladies Assaciation, of which Ropar's widow, Michelle, isamemnbér. The group also contributed $10,000 to helpde- fray expenses: The Busch cars displayed the memorials last week at Rockingham. NC.  ~ Roper competed in the previous ttitee NCTS races at Fontana. His best finish was 14th, inthe inaugural race, andhe was 18th in 1998 and 30th last year.  DRIVER OF THE YEAR: John Stim-  beris, thé transport driver forthe No-60 Cat Renial entry inthe Craftsman Truck Series, was named the truck driver of the year. _ Theawardis given tothe individyalwho combines hard work, diligence and sports- manship: Stimberis, selected by his peers, will receive $500, a trophy and $500 forhis favorite charity: .

ETS - ENVIRONMENTAL PFOBACCO SMOKE  The issue of smoking in public, which arises from health allegations about the exposure  of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke fETS) ~ often referred to as "passive smoking" - appears frequently in the media and has generated considerable publie eoncern.  It has been claimed that it is necessary to restrict or ban smoking tn publie places in erder to protect the ‘rights’ and the health of the non-smokers. This ta part of a  campaign to make smoking soetally unacceptable.  The ETS tssue has lately been the aubject of several major reports, such as those recently published by the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. National Research Couneil, whieh, anong others, have been used to support the anti-smoking movement, even though tt has been widely acknowledged in the setentifie literature that evidence relating ETS to health effects is ineonelustve and that much morei research  needs to be done.7 The National Research Council's Report itself stresses 21 times  in 18 pages, the need for further research.  Much of the limited avatlable research whieh has been used to promote smoking bans  has been criticised by independent scientists and at international conferences.”  Moreover, other studies on environmental tebaceo smoke do not support the claims of proven adverse health effects.7° Nonethelesa, moves to restrict or ban smoking  continue to be encouraged.  For example, with respect to smoking at the workplace, the 1986 U.&S. Surgeon General's Report called for restrtetions on smoking in the workplace, and claimed that such moves as improving ventilation would not help to lessen the atleged danger from ETS.

SMOKING GUIDELINES, SMOKING POLICIES AND ACCOMMODATION PROGRAMS UTILIZING ADEQUATE VENTILATION Smoking guidelines, smoking policies and accommodation can offer methods (i) to address the interests of smokers and nonsmokers, (ii) to reduce nonsmoker exposure to ETS - the extent depending upon the type of policy or accommodation that is implemented, all (iii) at little or no additional cost.  Because most of all U.S. businesses have smoking policies, federal regulation that encourages the use of individualized policies should be heipful to business, Such flexibility will also allow employees and employers to interact in a meaningful way on these issues to craft the best possible solution for their work environment, [For reference, see Materials Volume at Tab No. 2,  and Tab No. 3,]  e SEPARATION OF SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS, SHARING A COMMON VENTILATION SYSTEM  Simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers in the workplace has a profound effect upon nonsmoker exposure to ETS, Depending upon the configuration of individual workplaces, exposures of nonsmokers to ETS constituents Teportedly have been reduced dramatically ~ in some instances, to levels at or below the limits of detection or quantitation for air monitoring devices. Further, simple spatial separation of smokers and nonsmokers has proven effective in minimizing nonsmoker exposure to ETS in a variety of settings under various existing HVAC configurations, including those that provide recirculated air, existing exhausts, pressure- zoning and/or local filtration. In short, simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers  significantly reduces nonsmoker exposure to ETS, at little or no additional cost.  &bZLESIO’?  2  Missowi\0046245.02 __label__Scientific
THE MEASUREMENTS OF NICOTINE INTRAPUFF DELIVERY  _ _ Evon L. Crooks Dwo Lynm  Research and Development Bowman Gray Technical Center R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem North Carolina 27102.  SUMMARY eG  Time resolved measurements of intrapuff nicotine delivery in mainstream smoke have been performed with a specially designed intrapuff smoking apparatus (IPSA). The IPSA-filter traversing mechanism collects mainstream particulates on a rectangular filter pad which moves at a constant velocity perpendicular to the direction of smoke flow at the mouth end of the cigarette. Filter pads were assayed by two analytical techniques. Standard gas chromatographic (GC) methodology was used to quantitate nicotine concentration in five equal time segments per puff.” A second method, using a Berthold TLC- Linear Analyzer, measured total radioactivity across the pad for 14C-nicotine labelled cigarettes.  Intrapuff nicotine concentrations were determined from measured puff flow profiles and the collected masses of nicotine on the filters. GC nicotine concentration measurements correlated well with total activity from the scanner measurements. Studies carried out with full-  Flavor cigarettes revealed that nicotine concentrations in the smoke vary significantly during a puff. .- -  This work provides a new technique for studying time-resolved delivery of mainstream smoke components. It may also be used to elucidate  mechanisms controlling the delivery of nicotine and other mainstream smoke components.  INTRODUCTION  It has become increasingly important to better understand the - mechanisms by which smoke components, (especially nicotine) are delivered to mainstream smoke. To this end, instrumentation was developed to make time- resolved measurements of mainstream smoke components during - individual puffs. Central to the function of IPSA is a means of measuring  puff flow- rate profiles accurately. The method for measuring puff profiles was a modification of that reported by Reynolds (1).  oe The absence of these types of measurements in the literature is : testimony to evidence for their difficulty. For example, Ceschini (3) - reported the evolution of gas-vapour phase and total particulate matter  6986 6580S __label__Report
Shifting Age-Parity  Distribution of  Births     and the Decrease in Infant Mortality  NAOMI M. MORRIS. MD. MPH J. RICHARD UDRY, PhD CHARLES L. CHASE. MSPH     Possible causes for a decline in the infant mortality rate during the late 1960s are proposed and examined statistically.     Introduction  The infan: mortality rate in the United States has dectined since 1960. From 1930 to 1965 the decline was negligible and was a cause for alarm. Most of the decline has occurred since 1965. During the period! 1965 to 1970 the rate dropped from about 25 to about 20 deaths per 1,000 live births» Data through 1972 indicate that it is continuing to fall al the same rate,  One possihle eyplanation for the fall in infant mortality tats is related to the falling birth rate observed during the late 1960s. The dectise in ithe overall infant mortality rate could have been caused by births proportion- ately shifting from high mortality risk age and birth order cells to lower risk cells.” This explanation thus attributes  The authors are with the Department of Maternal and Child Health, School of Public Health, University of North Carolma, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27524. This arlicle was prepared for presentation to the Biostatistics Section at the 100th Annual Meetme of the American Public Health Association, Allanuic Cry, New Jersey, November 15, 1972, and was revved December, 1974. The research was supported by Grant MC-R-370029-06-0, from the Research Drision, Maternal and Child Health Services, HSA, Depart- ment of Health, Education, and Welfare |  * Defaning average risk axa rate equal to the observed overall infant mortality cate for the ycar plus or minus 10 per ceni, using data from the 1960 Live Birth Cohort Siudy, ugh nsk age-birth order cells are seen to be any births to girls under 15, parities 2 and over born to mothers 18 10.79, parities 4 and over, piothers, 20 to 24 and 48 to  the reduction in mortadity rate to “family planning.” (Note: not family planning services, necessarily. but individual decisions and behavior). We will show that the changing age-birth order distribution of births since 1965 does account for about 27 per cent of the reduction in the United States infant mortality rate that has occurred.  Another possible explanation concerns the advent of better maternity and infant care services for high risk mothers. In 2965 the first Maternity and Infant Care Projects (MIC), funded by the U.S. Children’s Bureau, were operating. By 1970 more than 125,000 women per year (counting new maternity admissions only) were being served by such projects. The effect would presumably be the reduction of the risk of infant mortaliiy within high risk categories to something on the order of risk experi enced by low risk categories.  Nicholas Wright has speculated concerning the first explanation,’ Reviewing developments of the 1960s, he has stated, “With 1960 birth order-specific infant mortwity  49, parities 5 and over, mothers 25 to 29; parities 6 and over, mothers 30 to 44. Low risk age-birth order cells are parities 1 and 2, born to mothers 20 to 24; parities 1 to 4, born to mothers 25 to 29, parities 2 to 4, born to mothers 30 to 34, and parities 2 to 6, born to mothers 35 to 39.' This risk distribution is supported by data from the National Natality Survey snd the National Infant Mortality Survey of 1963-1966, but inasmuch as these data were confined to legitimate, single births we prefer to use the more representative da‘a from the 1960 Live Birth Cohort Study for the cateuiations in this paper.'**           INFANT MORTALITY 3&9 __label__Scientific

University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA, the “Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Biology (FF20), Department of Molecular Cardiology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA  Summary  Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to cells but it is not known whether this competition is due to the ability of Lp(a) to interact directly with plasminogen receptors. In the present study, we demon- strate that Lp(a) can interact directly with plasminogen binding sites on monocytoid U937 cells and endothelial cells. The interaction of Lp(a) with these sites was time dependent, specific, saturable, divalent ion in- dependent and temperature sensitive, characteristics of plasminogen binding to these sites. The affinity of plasminogen and Lp(a) for these sites also was similar (Ky = 1-3 44M), but Lp(a) bound to fewer sites (~10-fold less). Both gangliosides and cell surface proteins with car- boxy-terminal lysyi residues, including enolase, a candidate plasmino- gent receptor, inhibited Lp(a) binding to U937 cells, Additionally, Lp(a) interacted with low affinity lipoprotein binding sites an these cells which also recognized LDL and HDL. The ability of Lp(a} to interact with sites on cells that recognize plasminogen may contribute to the pathogenetic consequences of high levels of circulating Lp(a).  Introduction  Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a distinct lipoprotein particle, which is as- sociated with the development of premature atherosclerosis and with disease processes involving thrombosis (1-7). Lp(a) has a structure si- milar to low density lipoprotein (LDL) but contains an unique apopro- tein, apopratein(a) [apo(a)], which is disulfide-linked to apoB-100. Apo(a) is highly homologous to plasminogen. The cDNA of the apo(a) isoform which was sequenced predicted a structure containing 38 kringles, disulfide-looped structures of ~80 amino acids; of these, 37 were 75-85% identical to kringle 4 of plasminogen and one was 91% identical to kringle 5 of plasminogen (8). The kringles of plasminogen possess lysine binding functions and are important in mediating the interactions of plasminogen with its substrates and inhibitors. Lp(a) particles also may exhibit lysine binding properties and interfere with     Correspondence to: Dr. E. F.

Plasminogen interacts with cel] surfaces via its kringles (14). The in- teraction of plasminogen with cells has profibrinolytic consequences, and Lp(a) competes for the interaction of plasminogen with cells (17-19). This competition inhibits plasminogen activation on cell sur- faces (19, 20), an effect which may contribute to the thrombotic and atherosclerotic risks associated with high levels of circulating Lp(a). The interpretation of these experiments has been that Lp(a) binds to plasminogen receptors. Although apo(a) binds directly to endothelial cells, it was not shown whether this interaction was inhibited by plas- minogen (19). Lp(a) binding to human monocyte-derived macrophages has been demonstrated, but a potential contribution of plasminogen binding sites was not evaluated in this study (21). Indeed, apo(a) has the ability to interact with adherent skin fibroblasts via mechanisms not shared with plasminogen (22). Moreover, direct interaction of apo(a) with a mouse macrophage cell line (P388D.1) was inhibited by acetylated LDL and was totally unaffected by plasminogen (23).  Based upon these inconsistencies, we have sought to test whether the intact Lp(a) particle can interact directly with plasminogen binding sites on cells. Complicating such an analysis are the interactions of Lp(a) with lipoprotein binding sites on cells. Interaction of Lp(a) with the high affinity apoB/E receptor for LDL has-been demonstrated although Lp(a} appears to have a lower affinity for these sites (24-26). Interaction of modified Lp(a) with the scavenger receptor, which also binds other modified (acetylated or oxidized) but not native lipopro- teins, has been demonstrated (27). Finally, many cells express “non- selective” lipoprotein binding sites (28-31). These sites bind both LDL and HDL. Such interactions are presumably dependent upon the lipid or hydrophobic character of the lipoprotein particles. To dissect the inter- action of Lp(a) with plasminogen binding sites, we have selected specific cell types, culture conditions and assay conditions to block its interaction with lipoprotein binding sites.  Experimental Procedures  Proteins and lipoproteins, Lp(a) was prepared from fresh human plasma by flotation centrifugation followed by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepha- rose and CsCl density gradient centrifugation as described (32, 33). No conta- Tnination of the preparations by plasminogen was detected by either Coomassie Blue staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels or by treatment with strep- tokinase and measuring plasmin activity with a chromogenic substrate. $2251. The sensitivities of these assays excluded plasmin(ogen) contamination of >1% and >0.4%, respectively. Lp(a)-free LDL (21), HDL (34) and acetylated LDL (35) were prepared as previously described. The LDL contained no apoA-1 and     40005199 __label__Scientific

While an ad/pack test is planned, a package design test would provide Marketing with results in a shorter time frame and serve as an early read of smoker interest and choice within the packaging alternatives.  “The test would follow the same format as previous Blues pack test. 300 full flavor menthol smokers would be interviewed with 75% 18-34 years of age and 25% 35-54 years of age. The sample would be evenly divided by sex and size of cigarette smoked.  Eligible respondents would be exposed to each of the three packs, one at a time, on a rotated basis. Following the exposure and rating.of the packs monadically, participants would be shown the three Blues packs — side-by-side and questioned as to their preference and reasons why. Consumers would then be exposed to a few unfinished ads; more specifically, just pictures of people smoking, and then they would be asked to select the one pack which best fits with the pictures of the  people.

QI-2ea  THE REPORTER  FON? QU LAC. WI RIRE- (028 ee See ($)21. See OR TLY,  ies  Unser spoils Mansell’s fun  . PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — It. ' was almost a superhuman effort for Nigel Mansell, and it still wasn’t enough Saturday as Al Unser Jr., the point man on the dominating Marlboro Team Penske, snatctied the pole for to-  i a s oe Nee evoe’s 200 at Portland International Speed-  ' Way.  Mansell showed up at the  post-qualifying interview with his driving suit soaked by perspi-  ration and his energy spent after doing every- thing in his     power to win AUTO  is secon  straight Port- __RACING _ Jand pole,  The defending PPG Cup ca ion did break the track record with a lap of tte. 651 mph, but Unser's rast lap of 116.861, coming in the fi- nal 60 seconds of the 30-minute session, gave him his second pole of the season and fifth of his career.  “T wrung it’s neck out there,” Mansell said of his Ford Cos- worth-powered Lola. “I proba- bly had one of the few cars air- borne through half the chicane. It was the best we could do and I’m just ‘glad we were able to  push him as well as we did.  “But, give the Penske team it’s due, that was a brilliant lap.”  Mansell has yet to win his first race this season while watching the Penske trio of Unser, former track record-holder Emerson Fit- tipaldi and Paul Tracy win five  of six, including the last five in a row,     A Nigel Mansell pulls a mask over his head as he prepares for qualifications for today's Budweiser-G.!. Joe’s 200 Indy- car race. Mansell broke the  track record and had the pole  position until Al Unser, Jr. snatched it away in the final minute of Saturday’s qualifying.  Now the Englishman finds himself surrounded by Marlboro red and white, with Unser along- side on the front row and Fitti- paldi and Tracy right behind in the second row for the start of today’s 102-lap, 189.9-mile event on the 1,.95-mile, nine-turn road course.  Fittipaldi, whose record was 115.730, also broke the mark with a 116.101, followed by Tra- cy’s 115.685.  Rookie Jacques Villeneuve was fifth at 115.604, followed by Jimmy Vasser (115. 370), Robby Gordon and Mauricio Gugi (both 114.849) and Michael An-  dretti, a three-time Portland win- ner and winner of the season- opener in Australia (114.700).  Unser, who won from the pole last month in the Indianapolis 500, said of Saturday’s perfor. mance: “A lot of it had to do with cloud cover that came over near the end. The sun was beat- ing down halfway through (the session) and 1 was working on the balance of the car, trying to get it right.  “And we were also keeping an eye on Nigel because he can throw down a fast one at any time.”  The pole was worth one more point to Unser, who now leads Fittipaldi 83-70 in the driver standings. Andretti is third at 59, followed by Gordon (52), Mansell (46), and Tracy, coming off a win at Detroit, and Vasser (both 36).  Now Mansell, who'says he still believes he is in the points race with 10 events remaining,  must find a way to beat the three —-  Ilmor-powered Penskes.  “Perhaps I ought to paint my car red and white for the race be- cause I know with these three  Penskes around me, it’s going to be difficult to win,” Mansell said with a weak grin.  “But I give my boys credit,”’ he added. “Up-until one minute to go, we thought we might have gotten the pole. In the race, the Penskes will be hard to beat, but you just have to go out there and do your best and hope for the best.”  é  ggz0gles0? __label__News
Avoust 14, 1268  MONTHLY. REPORT  August 1968 Chin K. Lee  GLUCOSE ISOMERASE  I have been using the resorcinol method in determining the fructose produced by isomerase reaction. Although this method is sensitive enough to detect 0.025 uMoles of fructose, the reproducibility was unsatisfactory. Therefore, I sought a method which allows best differential measurement of fructose in the presence of large quantities of glucose with dependable reproducibility. The improved method was obtained by modifying the con- ditions employed for the resorcinol method. Briefly, the new method js as follows: 1.0 ml. of sample containing 0.1 to 5.0 yMoles of fructose,  3.0 ml. of 12.2 N HC1, and 1.0 ml. of 0.05% resorcinol in absolute ethanol are incubated at 60° C. for 5 minutes and cooled immediately at 0°. Absorb- ance measured at 410 my» shows linear relationship with the concentration of fructose. In this method, 100 pMoles of glucose give the same optical density as 0.45 uMoles of fructose (220 fold); whereas, in the old method, 35 uMoles of glucose were equivalent to 0.25 yMoles of ghicose (140 fold)  in the optical density. 4  Bs at2S@_  The effort to purify the isomerase brought some progress. The protamine sulfate treated extract was subjected to acetone fractionation and then  ammonium Sulfate fractionation. The combined treatment resulted in about  tenfold increase in specific activity with 90% recovery. Further purifi- cation by means of column chromatography is now under progress.  ANALYTICAL SERVICE  Five hundred eighty-two samples of maltose and 60 samples of fructose were analyzed during the period of July 13 to August 13.  CKL: pws  6 Oo oO © @ O ~! ~ ~~: __label__Report

COMMENTS ON CANCER INCIDENCE     Epidemiological studies of death rates have claimed that a strong association exists between cigarette smoking and increased risk of death in cancer of (a) lung and bronchus, (b) buccal cavity and pharynx, and (c) prostate.  If one is interested in analyzing the factors that may be involved in the causation of cancer, the incidence of the various types of that disease is more pertinent to analysis than are death rates.  No attempt to cover all epidemiological data on cancer morbidity has been made but the data from reports by two State Departments of Health(1»2) are sufficiently challenging to justify their presentation and to urge further collection, study and analysis of similar data from other sources.  As examples of the claimed increased risk of cigarette smokers  (3)  over non-smokers, Hammond and Horn 1958 give the figures of 31 times for lung cancer, 7 times for buccal cavity cancer, and 1.90 for genito-urinary cancer in white males. Skin cancer is not included as such in their data. There is, however, a "catchall" classification of cancer of "other specific sites," in which skin cancer would be presumably included. In this group, the death rate among cigarette smokers is recorded as being only 0.89 that of non-smokers.  It is fair to state, therefore, that there is no epidemiological evidence of association of cigarette smoking with death from skin cancer.  It has repeatedly been claimed that the generally-admitted increase in cigarette smoking during the past several decades is a significant, if not the main, causative factor in the increased death rate from lung, buccal cavity and  prostatic cancer.  Let us see whether incidence rates of these diseases bear out this  sweeping and basic hypothesis. Data are given in Table 1. __label__Scientific

Cridlin, Jr. MEMBERSHIP - THE PTC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF THE GEORGE  -WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY     I am well aware of this organization and can readily endorse it mainly by its reputation. I, personally, have never attended the PTC meetings, but those who have speak highly of the work and objectives of this group, This Institute investigates various problems in the field of intellectual and industrial property and its association with the George Washington University enhances the Institute's ability to attract qualified persons to conduct the necessary studies  to fulfill its objectives,  The DuPont Company actively supports this endeavor and Samuel Lenher, a DuPont vice president, is on its advisory council, I am not certain which other companies support the Institute, but I would imagine companies such as G.E., IBM, Monsanto, etc., which have large patent programs are contributors. If you would like a list of contributors, 1 believe I could get  one for you.  The work of this Institute is worthwhile and my recommendation would be for Philip Morris to support the PTC Institute, I would think the minimum amount of $500 to be a participating  member would be an adequate subscription.  elle Cradle Sf  William B.

fo  Yr Gul |  CTR Grant 3966 Principal Investigator: Thomas Smithgall  Title: Regulation of ras signaling by the c-fes proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase  Critique: The applicant has shown that c-fes, which is proposed to be linked to GM-CSF, interleukin 3 and erythropoietin receptor signaling pathways has been shown to cause myeloid cell differentiation and to block GM-CSF-mediated cell proliferation. The applicant proposes that the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase c-fes exerts its antigrowth and differentiating effects by opposing the major growth pathway involving activated ras. The applicant has clearly identified a very important question, because it is clear that tyrosine kinases are involved in differentiation as well as in proliferation. The strengths of this proposal are several: Firstly, the importance of the question addressed; secondly, the extensive background work carried out by the principal investigator, both in published work from his postdoctoral fellowship and in publications and preliminary data obtained as an independent investigator, thirdly, the use of straightforward, readily interpretable assays focusing on the effect of c-fes on GAP activity; and fourthly, broader considerations of the effects of c- fes involving other components of the mitogenic signaling cascades such as fos, shc, and vav.  The Principal Investigator received his Ph.D. in 1986 in pharmacology from the University of Pennsylvania where he studied steroid metabolizing enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism. His postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health began his work on tyrosine kinases and specifically c-fes, its biological activity and interaction with GAP. He has a very strong publication record with important studies published in highly refereed and quality journals, such as Biochemistry and The Journal of Biological Chemistry. He became an Assistant Professor at the Eppley Institute in 1991. He presently has National Institutes of Health and American Cancer Society support, the latter for salary. Budget should be reduced to a bingle.  Resume; This is an excellent proposal by a young assistant professor to study the molecular mechanisms through which the tyrosine kinase c-fes induces cell differentiation. The excellent publication record, the importance of the question and the focused nature of the studies make this an outstanding proposal. In this application, as in several others reviewed, the applicant requests funds for a specific project that is conceptually related to and uses the same tools as that of an NIH grant that is on-going. I would suggest discussion of the generic problem of individuals submitting multiple grants to study a single question with one grant being sent in for each small aspect of the general question and hypothesis, i.e., none of these represent distinct lines of inquiry. Recommend approval at a scientific priority of 1.2.     40009604 __label__Scientific

oF an nmnntnice ae  a ae        THE K* CHANNEL OF SARCOPLASMIC RETICULUM  A New Look at Cs* Block  SAMUEL CUKIERMAN, GARY YELLEN, AND CHRISTOPHER MILLER Graduate Department of Biochemistry, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts  ABSTRACT K_*-selective ion channels from mammalian sarcoplasmic reticulum were inserted into planar phospholipid bilayers, and single-channel currents measured in salutions containing Cs*. Current through this channel can be observed in symmetrical solutions containing only Cs* salts. At zero voltage, the Cs* conductance is approximately 15-fold lower than the corresponding K* conductance. The open channel rectifies strongly in symmetrical Cs* solutions, and the Cs* currents are independent of Cs* concentration in the range 18-600 mM. Biionic (Cs*/K*) reversal potentials are only 10 mV, showing that Cs” is nearly as permeant as K‘, though much less conductive. Addition of Cs* to symmetrical K* solutions reduces current through the channel ia a voltage-dependent way. The results can be explained by a free energy profile in which the channel’s selectivity filter acts in two ways: to provide binding sites for the conducting ions and to serve as a major rate-determining structure. According to this picture, the main difference between high-conductance K* and low-conductance Cs* is that Cs* binds toan asymmetrically positioned site ~20-fold  more tightly than does K*.  INTRODUCTION  Virtually all K*-selective ion channels interact strongly with Cs*. Indeed, there is no known case in which a K* channe!—that is, an ion channel with a substantial select- ivity for K* over Na*—is not profoundly affected by Cs* in the millimolar range. In all cases studied, Cs* reduces K* current through the open channel, i.¢., it blocks the channel. The common mechanistic picture of this interac- tion is analogous to competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics: the Cs* ion can enter the normal K* conduction pathway, but cannot permeate it. Whenever a Cs* jon is thus stuck in the open channel, K* ions are literally blocked from permeating. K* ions must wait for the Cs* ion to leave the channel via the same route that it had entered before they can traverse the pore. Though many variations in detail have been offered in the literature of Cs* block of K* channels, such studies are usually inter- preted in terms of these basic elements: the strong binding and nonpermeation of the Cs* ion.  This picture is reasonable. A K*-selective site of low field strength may easily be expected to bind Cs* more strongly than K* (Eisenman, 1961). Since Cs* is slightly larger than K* (0.31 vs. 0.27 nm diameter, respectively), it is plausible to propose that simple steric hindrance accounts for the failure of Cs* to permeate the selectivity filter of a K* channel.  This study is concerned with Cs* block of a K*-selective  Dr. Cukierman’s permanent address is Instituto de Biofisica, Universi- dade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 21941 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  Bropnys. J. © Biophysical Society Volume 48 September 1985 477-484  channel {rom the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a channel whose ion conduction properties have been extensively studied (Coronado and Miller, 1979; Coronado et al., 1980; Miller et al.. 1984). Cs* has been shown to reduce K* currents through this channel in a particularly simple manner. Cs* appears to bind competitively with K* at a single site within the channel; the affinity of Cs* for this site varies with applied voltage as though the site is located 35% of the way down the voltage drop across the channel. Since Cs* is cifective as a blocker from only one side of the channel (the »:5 side), and since previous studies failed to detect conduction by Cs*, we concluded that this blocker ion is in fact impermeant, and therein lies its ability to inhibit K* conduction (Coronado and Miller, 1979).  The fact that Cs blocks the SR K* channel is surpris- ing, since it is known (Coronado and Miller, 1982) that organic cations as large as 0.5 nm in diameter can perme- ate; the smaller Cs* ion, then, cannot be excluded from permeating for purely steric reasons. We now show that our previous plug-in-the-bottle picture of Cs* block is incorrect, that the Cs* permeability is nearly as high as that of K*. We also show that a simple picture af Cs* conduction through the channel can quantitatively explain all our results on voltage-dependent inhibition of K* currents by Cs~ as well.as on open-channel currents under symmetrical Cs* and bionic Cs+ /K tconditions.     MATERIALS AND METHODS  In all experiments here, currents through single channels were recorded  by inserting pur SR membrane vesicles into planar hpid bilayers composed of 90% phosphatidylethanalamine/ 10% phosphatidyicholine.     0006-3495/85/09/477/8 $1.00 477 __label__Scientific

Sent: Thursday, July 01, 1999 8:59 AM To: Ittermann, Patti F.  Subject: ABC Reminder  In the April ABC newsletter the front page article was about the development of a Newspaper Reader Profile Service. Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Profile Service was to enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country.  You had asked me to remind you about this study in carly July so you could check on it when you attended the ABC meeting this month. I thought it might be interesting to get the results of the carly test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to market, especially given the availability of other "news" sources from market to market. A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 21-29 might be forced to read the daily newspaper to learn about club events, ctc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your memory - let me know and i'll give it to you.  joan  RJRO00000166 7034526 70030 2746  S869 e6ecs __label__Email

Caffeine - 1  Double-Blind Versus Deceptive Administration of Placebo Caffeine  Lynne J. Weixel Irving Kirsch University of Connecticut  Unlike double-blind pharmacological studies, in which subjects are informed that they will either receive a drug or a placebo, patients in nonresearch settings are told that they are receiving medication. Nevertheless, data from double-blind research are used to evaluate drugs for clinical administration. Thus, it is tacitly assumed that placebo and drug effects obtained in double-blind conditions are comparable to those obtained in clinical practice.  The present study was designed to investigate two aspects of expectancy: (1) the subjective probability of having consumed caffeine and (2) the amount of caffeine that subjects thought they may have been consumed. Experimental subjects were either led to believe that they were consuming caffeine (deceptive placebo administration) or that they might or might not be receiving caffeine (double-blind placebo administration). In addition, a no-beverage control group provided a baseline against which placebo effects could be evaluated. We hypothesized larger placebo effects with deceptive administration than with double-blind administration. Also, on the basis of Kirsch's (1985) response expectancy theory, we hypothesized a quadratic effect as a function of dose. Specifically, we expected to obtain larger placebo effects at moderate dosages than at small or extreme levels.  Method  In experimental conditions, a single cup of decaffeinated coffee was brewed in the subject's presence. Apparent dose was manipulated by using 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 heaping tablespoons of coffee in preparing the beverage. In double-blind administration conditions the coffee was prepared from one of two cans with labels marked "X" and "Y" respectively. A coin was tossed to determine the can from which the coffee was selected. Neither subject nor experimenter was aware that both cans contained decaffeinated coffee. In deceptive administration conditions the coffee was prepared from a single can bearing the label  of a well-known brand of caffeinated coffee. Control subjects were asked to wait for twenty minutes.  Before and after beverage consumption, an experimenter who was unaware of group assignment assessed subjects self-reported mood (alertness, relaxation, and tension), behavior (digit span, symbol substitution, reaction time, and rotor pursuit), and physiologic function (pulse rate and blood pressure). During pre-placebo assessment, subjects were asked to predict the effect of coffee on the each of the subjective feelings assessed by the mood scale and also to predict the effect of coffee on each of the behavioral measures. Following post-placebo assessment of dependent variables, subjects were asked to estimate the likelihood that the coffee they had consumed was caffeinated.  Results  Between group differences in mood, behavior, and physiological function were analyzed by means of orthogonal comparisons of mean residual change scores. Only deceptive administration produced a significant increase in pulse rate (Figure 1). Significant  oasscEe2ode __label__Scientific

I gave a good read to the last version of the Divestment Plan that you sent me (6/26) over the weekend, and I have three questions/comments...  1* In the Initial Efforts section, the last thing you list is "This is Philip Morris." I assume you mean CD's brochures "Committment to Jobs and Economic Growth" only, unless there  is something else I'm not aware of? What about bringing back the videotapes that we did for hte RDs awhile back?  2° We are taking the Committment brochures and creating updated one-page, four-color "Presence/Economic Impact” ads out of them for the RDs.

ASSOCIATED PRESS AAA WIRE  {caS  tar On  MAR  “Smokers Find Ally in Maryland Legislature  “By TOM STUCKEY=  “Associated Press Writer= ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) _ After years of watching their right to light  up slowly whittled away, smokers are abcut to get some relief from the Maryland General Assembly. . The legislature is nearing enactment of a bill that would make it illegal for employers to refuse to hire somecne because that person is a smoker. Both the House and Senate are on record as supporting the measure, making it likely a bill will be sent to the governor before the legislature adjourns April ia. Gov. William Donald Schaefer has not taken a position on the issue. Bruce C. Bereano, lobbyist for The Tobacco Institute, said he knows of no other state that has a Similar law, although the Viroinia legislature voted this year ta prohibit discrimination by state and local governments against smokers. Identical bills intreduced in the Maryland House and Senate go much further than the Virginia law, covering all private employers as well as public agencies. An employer could not refuse to hire or oroemete a worker or fire him simply because that employee smokes when he is not  at work.

INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE       PED        boop s ance! ws  ce Nt o4  a3 3  AF “ “Tk ONLY No “258 By September 14, 1988  pS » 3 tye mar MR. R. A. KAMPE tay  Re: Germany ~— Tax Classification  It has come to our attention today that the Ministry of Finance is likely to tax SPA as a cigarette. This unfortunate news comes as a result of a preliminary report  from the Customs Laboratory to the MOF.  In a meeting this morning with three MOF officials, W. Dembach and J. Freund were informed that the Customs Lab had analyzed our product, which is standard practice, and were of the opinion that SPA’s characteristics were most similar to a cigarette. This enables, if not obliges, the MOF to classify SPA under Section 3 of the tax law and apply a  cigarette tax rate.  It was stated at the meeting that this report was preliminary and is not binding on the MOF. However, W. Dembach did not see any indication that the MOF would rule  differently.  The meeting was called by Dr. Hafele, Parliamentary Under ~ Secretary (deputy minister reporting to Minister of Finance, Stoltenberg) and he invited Dr. Schmutzer (head of the department responsible for these issues) and Mr. Dittrich (the official directly in charge of RJR’s request). Absent from the meeting was Mr. Richter, who is Mr. Dittrich’s  superior and has been an advocate of RJR‘s position. Wilfried’s read on the situation is that Mr. Richter has not been able to exert sufficient influence and is no longer a  major factor in the MOF’s decision.  Apparently, Dr. Hafele expressed the opinion that SPA could be considered a cigarette product and taxed accordingly. He went on to say that the political issues of SPA’s investment value and social benefits were of no concern to the MOF in its interpretation of the law. In light of this, Wilfried believes that Mr. Dittrich will feel encouraged to  recommend a cigarette tax rate.  Nn °o 0) N ws @ ® h w __label__Letter

Srtmer JovRNAL WASHINGTON — Passive smake in the workplace might be a much bigger health danger than U.S. Workers have been led to halieve, according fo a new government study. The new findings come from the Cen- ters for Disease Control, and appear in a  Hearts and Wallets at Odds Iva wilikely that sither individuals or ‘mutual funds will be able to kek the habit of investing in tobacen companice, Fund Track, page C1.  special issue of the Journal of the Ameri- catt Medical Association on the heaith impacts of tobacco, At a news conference yesterday te publicize the journal’s re- search, AMA officials urged investors to avoid 13 stocks and 1,474 mutual funds that invest in tobacco manufacturing. The AMA Shed {ts own tobacco holdings in 1986.  The passive-sinoke findings represent fhe most extensive data ever compiled on nonsinokers’ exposure to cigarette smoke in the U.S. The new information will likely add ballast to antismoking groups' efforts at the federal, state and local levels to ban smoking in office buildings and other public places. .  According to the study, 87.9% of all nonsimkers in the U.S. have detectable levels of cotinine in their blood. Cotinine is . a nicotine residue chat turns up in the blood Serum of individuals exposed to tobacco smoke. The survey, conducted from 1988 to 1991, involved physical examinations of  12,678 Individuals nationwide, Nousmokers Understate Exposure  Of the noasmokers surveyed. 12.4% reported they were exposed fo tobacco smoke at work only, compared with 7.7% whe reported (hey were exposed to tobacco stnoke at home only; 38.8% reported no exposure at ali, and 3.1% reported expe Sure at both home and work.  The JAMA study offers strong evidence fhat people tend to understale their expo sure to passive smoke. There is a wide gap between nonsmokers who say they are  ‘exposed to tobacco smoke — 37% of adults and 43% of children — compared with the 37.9% whose cotinine shows they are ax- posed. This gap is significant because most previous studies of workplace paasive- stoke exposure, many af them funded by the tabacco industry, relied on survey data rather than blood samples. :  Even though the stody found that mora noUSMmOKers are exposed to tobacco smoke at work than at home, the study makes Clear that the amount of nlentine absorbed inte @ nonsmoxer’s bloodstreatt is likelier to ba higher iF one lives with 2 smoker than if one works with one. Nonstokers ex- Posed to tobacco at home had roughly twice as Much cotinine in their blood as nen-                      smokers exposed (o tobacco at work.  The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration has proposed a rep- ulation that would ban virtually all smok- ing in the workplace. Bui the agency has moved slowly in issuing a final rule ~ it isn't expected this year — partly because agency officials are combing through a mountain of public comments and partly because of budget euts. The new findings were made avaliable to OSHA before its comment period on the smoking rule ended in mid-January. ‘  The Environmental Protection Agency declared passive smoke a carcinogen nearly four years ago, but thelr finding has stirred some controversy in the scientific community, A racent report by the Con- gressional Research Service expressed such uncertainty on the opie that advo- cates far and against tobacea both claimed vindication from it.  But James Firkle, the study's lead author, yesterday said the new findings are “much better data than the CRS report ever looked at." ‘  But Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman forthe Tobacco Institute, said of the JAMA findings, “It's net a health-effects study.” She said the study focused on nicotine exposure as measured in “molecules, and that the source of these wace amounts might be certain foods, such as tomatoes or potatoes, or a “momentary whiff" of to- bacco smoke.

eS > foo Hogh RIR Interoffice Memorandum Faget 72/9  Contact Cement  Subject: Use of Weldwood Date: February 29, 1988 (egy Copy  To: Mr. Richard J. Hal} From: Or. Rob Harrington  Below is an evaluation of Weldwood Contact Cement manufactured by DAP, Inc. (Dayton, OH). Scientific Affairs approves the use of this product to secure gaskets to apron dryer doors. Product contact with this adhesive should be kept to a minimum. This adhesive contains solvents that may cause dizziness, headache and other health effect. Proper ventilation and the use  of rubber gloves are recommended when applying this adhesive.  This adhesive is composed of neoprene rubber in a 1,1,1 trichloroethane/ dichloromethane base.  Chloroprene rubber (neoprene or latex) is a polymer made from chloroprene monomers, It 1s commonly used to waterproof rubber materials such as gloves, coatings, belts, tires, etc, Chloroprene (2-chloro-1,3-butadiene) is a color- less flammable liquid with a high vapor pressure. Jn chronic Studies with mice and rats, chloroprene monomer was determined not to be carcinogenic. It is not considered to be a teratogen. Chloroprene is a respiratory tract irri- tant. At very high levels it can cause respiratory depression and asphyxia.  At levels above 300 ppm chloroprene can produce toxic effects. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set a threshold  limit value (TLV) of 10 ppm for exposure in the workplace. Polychloroprene rubber is essentially non toxic. It has an average molecular weight of  100,000. These polymers often contain sulfur. Pyrolysis products of the monomer or polymer include hydrogen chloride (HC1), sulfur dioxide (S09), car-  bon monoxide (CO) and small amounts of chloroprene, benzene, acetic ac mic acid, formaldehyde and various mercaptans.  1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform) is a clear nonflammable liquid with a very high vapor pressure. It has a low oral toxicity with an LD (le- thal dose to 50% of the test population) of approximately 8 g/kg (ACGIH, Documentation of Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices, 1986). It may also be absorbed through the skin. Contact with methyl chloro- form readily de-fats the skin and may Cause redness and scaling. Inhalation exposures to 500 ppm for 7 hours a day for 6 months did not cause any adverse effects in rats, rabbits or monkeys. High concentrations may cause anesthesia and levels above 15,000 ppm may be fatal. It is not considered to be a car-  cinogen or a teratogen. Due to its low toxicity, the ACGIH has set a TLV of 350 ppm in the workplace.  Dichloromethane (methylene chloride) is a colorless, highly volatile liquid. It 4s used in paint removers, solvents, and degreasing agents.

TO: J. A. Herberger FROM:4.B,..6, Devey....g Re: Project AA Menthol  As you requested, the Brand has conducted an analysis to deter- mine the viability for introducing Project AA as a 100mm Full Flavor and Fuller Flavor Low Tar menthol only brand family targeted at stylish females and selling at a premium price. The  following advantages and disadvantages are apparent from this proposition:  Advantages  o Introducing AA as a menthol would give a separate reason for being to both AA and MG. Switching interaction would be Minimal if AA were the menthol prestige positioned brand targeted toward women and MG were non-menthol prestige brand  for men. In effect, this action would give each brand a separate, unique identity.  © Currently, there are no “stand alone" prestigious positioned  7 menthol brands on the cigarette market. Female menthol smokers who desire feminine, stylish, prestigious image reinforcement must choose from B & H Deluxe Ultra Light, Players, Satin or Sterling. All four of these brands have menthol and non-menthol style alternatives which account for -89 and 1.21 % SOM respectively (as of May, 1984 YTD). Also, only Satin offers female intensive image reinforcement. There is a potential for AA, as a menthol FF/FFLT style with a prestige, female image, to find a niche among these stylish/prestigious brands.  e A potential exists for increasing switching gains for AA from female Berson & Hedges Menthol (FF and FFLT) and Virginia Slims Ment >1 (FF and FFLT) given AA's female specific image reinforcen. < (which Benson & Hedges lacks) and AA's  prestigiou: mage reinforcement (which is not available in Virginia S1 -).

Glass, D.M.D., DrPH., Edward R. Loftus, DM_D.; John E. Alman, M.A.;and Ralph P. Feller, D.M.D.  ABSTRACT-The purpose of the present study is 10 evaluate the distribution, determinants, changes and inter-relationships observed in oral health oral Pisease and ora} function from findings of periodic examinations performed at regula: pitervals in a Population of male vetcrans in pood health at the outset.  Few comprehensive studies of oral health have betn carried ovt in adult populations. The most extensive surveys have been those of the U. S. National Health Survey of the Public Health Service (NCHS, 1965). These latter, hke most efforts to evaluate health and disease, are cross-sectional in design. Longitudinal studies of dental interest include those of growth and development of the cranio-facial structures (Stuart etal., 1959; Moortees, 1959, 1965; Sillman, 1964: Baum. 1950). Except for studies of bone TesoTpiion associated with complete dentures (Johnson, 1967; Tallgren, 1969), no Jong zange or large scale longitudinal studies of the orofacial structures have been carried out in an  adult population. THE STUDY POPULATION  The present study is an extension of a parent longitudinal study, the Normative Aging Study initiated in 1963 at the Veterans Administration Outpatient Clinic in Boston (Bell et al., 1966). The study population o: cohort consists of some 2,000 healthy males between 25-75 ycars of age.  The cohort is self-selected in that it consists of volunteers screened to obtain at the outset subjects that meci specific health criteria, represent wide socio-economic ranges and show signs of geographic stability. Healthy subjects were obtained through the following procedures. 4 prescreening phase was carried out by requesting volunteers to fill out a medical questionnaire, results of which Provided the basis for rejecting subjects with known diseases. The next Screening operation consisted of examinations of blood Pressure, electrocardiograms, bload sugar, pulmonary function and chest radiographs.  - Those passing the latter tests were subjected to a final medical examination including biochemical, physiological, and sociological parameters. 11 is noteworthy that the subjects were selected for the parent study without any consideration given to dental health.  The comprehensive series of examinations and tests employed to screen subjects for inclusion at the outset are fepeated every five years along with anthropometric  Aging sod Heme Development, Volume 3, 1972 Ns  PUBLICATIONS  10322405  003667 __label__Scientific

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A.  Inter Office Correspondence                  TO: Distribution DATE: June 8, 1994  FROM: Jim Maggio  SUBJECT: Revi Incremental Production Costs/Paper to Vinyl  The attached details the revised incremental "production" costs associated with a conversion to vinyl for the various PM bulletin pools. The additional costs for transportation and art (less separation savings) are now included. Importantly, costs have actually declined slightly for the Corporate pool versus those presented on Monday, while Marlboro costs  have increased nominally.  Separation charges, which average $5,000 per design, will be eliminated when converting to vinyl production. The savings applies only to the Corporate pool, given that Marlboro separation charges were included in the Marcann paper printing costs. As a result, minor increases in transportation costs due to heavier weight for vinyl was more than offset by significant savings due to the elimination of separation charges for the Corporate pool. Below is a breakdown of the revised incremental costs per unit per cycle for both pools.  .. INCREMENTAL COSTS/U NIT/CY CLE  Marlboro ~ Original Revised 14x 48 $ 78 $ 90  20 x 60 281 312 Corporate  19.6 x 48 119 101  20 x 60 69 - 282  Note that it is now cost effective to produce the 20 x 60 Corporate pool on vinyl vs. paper !  Fiscal 1994 and full year '95 revised incremental production costs for vinyl are outlined on the attached. Total incremental Marlboro pool production costs for fiscal 1994 totals $57,000 while the Corporate pool totals an incremental $21,000 for fiscal '94 (or $5m per  brand for the 4 cycles).  Assuming brand approval, we will proceed with the conversion effective with the November posting for Virginia Slims in the Corporate pool and for Marlboro in the 14 x 48 and 20 x 60 pools. We will also coordinate viewing for the vinyl/paper “test” which will be available for viewing in Maspeth, Queens during the  week of June 27th.  GASLVEO90S __label__Memo
Lirillard     MEMORANDUM August 1, 1974 TO > Dr. H. J. Minnemeyer FROM : P. D. Schickedantz  SUBJECT: PMO Aerosolization  Formulations have been prepared with the object of obtaining a PMO aerosol which would enable human inhalation  of about 30 mg of PMO over a period of a few minutes to a few hours.  Test formulations were dispensed using a Devilbis Model # 40 hand-buib nebulizer operated either by squeezing or by low pressure laboratory air after removing the bulb. The  amount of liquid dispensed, found by weight loss after a given number of squeezes, was as follows:  mg/squeeze Water 2.7 1:1 propylene glycol-water (w/w) 2.0 PMO saturated 4:1 propylene glycol-water (w/w) 0.93 PMO saturated propylene glycol 0.4  The variability in delivery is undoubtedly due either to evaporation, in the case of water, or weight gain of water by hydroscopic propylene glycol. The true delivery is probably about 1 mg/squeeze as was obtained for the 4:1  propylene glycol-water mixture which should be nearly in equilibrium with air at 35% humidity.  The room temperature solubility (@ 24°C) of PMO was found  to be 123 mg/g in propylene glycol and 65 mg/g in 4:1 propylene  glycol-water (w/w). (For practical purposes PMO is insoluble in water or glycerine.)  Using 1 mg of solution/squeeze as the delivery, 240 squeezes would be required to deliver 30 mg of PMO from PMO  saturated propylene glycol and 460 squeezes for PMO saturated 4:1 propylene glycol-water.  The nebulizer filled with PMO saturated 4:1 propylene  glycol-water was operated using the laboratory air supply. A rotometer in the air line read 15 scfh at 5 psi. The weight  SSPPOTOO __label__Memo

I would like to maintain some type of collaborative research effort even at this time when our R&D department has severely limited financial resources. ] have handed your proposal to Dr. Burger for examination and I understand he will attempt to secure funding from sources outside of R & D. I also have included a booklet concerning a request for applications of funding from CIAR (Center for Indoor Air Research) which includes several R J Reynolds representatives on the Board of Directors and on the list of Peer Reviewers. CIAR would look with interest at an application concerning ETS exposure systems for in vitro toxicology.  After reviewing your agreement with RJR, I noticed the termination date was March 31, 1997. | have contacted our legal department to extend this date to December 31, 1997 to allow adequate time and prevent a rush to utilize the funds you have remaining. I have been very pleased with the results from the cytotoxicity and micronuclei assays completed with the funds used to date and look forward to initial results investigating the in vitro smoke exposure system with the remaining funds. I am hopeful that any results obtained with HiQ using your in vitro smoke exposure system would benefit our continued collaboration on refining this promising technology for in vitro smoke exposure. Please let me know if I can provide any scientific expertise on the exposure system or the cell cultures.  Gow, With Kind Regards, . oS suk y (th, David W.

Although no statistical significant differences were run for this rating summary, the following similarities and differences are apparent: ,  - The FF NM 85mm female smokers appear to want a somewhat less strong, less harsh cigarette with less tobacco taste than the male counter- parte. However, all of their product ideal ratings in relation to their actual product ratings are in the same direction as the male  category.  - The FFLT NM 85mm female smokers also appear to want a less strong, less harsh cigarette with lesa tobacco taste, as well as an easier draw. However, the female and male actual ratings are diametrically posi-~ tioned in relation to their ideals on strength and tobacco taste. Specifically, the females want a less strong tasting cigarette with slightly less tobacco taste, whereas the males want a stronger tasting cigarette with eignificantly more tobacco taste.  © A review of open-end responses from a recent Project SM Product Guidance Test was conducted to provide insight and ideas for the development of a new chewing tobacco questionnaire. Results indicate that respondents cite many quality of flavor and aroma attributes which are not asked on our current questionnaire. Many respondents mentioned fruit flavor, pipe tobacco flavor, artificial taste, sour taste, licorice taste and sweet aroma, Additionally, many respondents cited burning and biting sensa- tions from the tobacco, indicating a need to further explore the mouth  feel dimension of the product.  e@ Preliminary results of the FFLT Tar Limit Study were presented to Applied R&D. Additional analyses are planned based on the conclusions reached from preliminary results. Maximum ratings for overall acceptance are associated with high tar levele. In general, of the two tar influencing variables studied, air dilution is of much greater importance than filter pressure in affecting attribute movement. Response surfaces for strength, tobacco taste, rich taste and natural taste all have contours similar to those for overall acceptance measures, with maximum ratings along ridges at moderate to lower air dilutions irrespective of filter pressure. Strength related attributes appear to be driving consumer  L62e 6b905 __label__Letter

Parrish SUBJECT: Conference Follow-Up  As I mentioned at the Corporate Affairs World Conference, I] want to follow-up with all participants on a number of issues.  First of all, I would like to thank everyone for attending and to convey a special thanks to those of you who participated in presentations or panel discussions or led the issues groups. I believe everyone who attended felt challenged and I trust a good time was had by all.  However, we know there is always room for improvement for the next conference, and I suggested two ways in my closing remarks - a stronger international focus and a site outside North America. But | want to hear more from each of you. To that end, I have attached a questionnaire for your comments. Please give us your frank and honest opinion and return it to Hector Irastorza in the Washington, D.C. office by January 15, 1996. It will be important when planning future conferences.  Also, as promised, attached are the final reports of each of the issues discussion groups and Jim Lindheim’s summary of "key learnings” from the three panel presentations. I hope you will find them of interest. Please share them with your colleagues in your departments, especially those who were unable to attend the conference. If you have any comments on any particular issue, please let me know.  For those of you who are interested in receiving copies of any of the internal presentations, please contact Peter Mirabella in the New York Office and he will make every effort to comply with your request. However, please be aware that although our executives were most pleased to be with us, they are somewhat reluctant to distribute copies of their speeches because of the confidentiality and sensitivity of some of the information in their presentations. Where that is the case, we are looking to see if edited versions could be  made available.  SETS BOF OR __label__Memo

T CELL GROWTH WITHOUT SERUM’  VICTORIA L. HERZBERG anv Dartmouth Medteal School, Hanover. NH 03756  From the Department of Medicine.  Most in vitro T cell proliferation experiments are performed by serum-supplemented medium, ents  yet the actual contributions of serum camponcr Ls  to cell cycle progression remain ill-defined. complicating attempts to fully define requirements for cell division. By utilizing a Functional separation  between T cell receptor-triggered “competence” and IL 2-promoted “progression” to indcpendently as- sess Serum requirements during each cell cycie  active role only during the early events of the com- petence phase (Go-G, transition) of T cell activation. Serum is required for optimal IL 2 production and the cell surface expression of IL 2 receptors after the stimulation of the T;/T, antigen receptor com- pilex. In contrast. serum docs not function actively during IL 2-mediated progression through the G, phase of the cycle. Serum Proteins serve only a Passive role at this si je. preventing the adsorption of IL 2. This same c fect can be provided by any number of proteins including IL 2 itself. or even a high cell concentration. Supplementation of serum- free T cell cultures solely with IL 2 and transferrin is sufficient for maximal T cell Proliferation. al- though the time of the Peak response is delayed owing to a suboptimal rate of IL 2 receptor expres- sion, Accordingly, the realization that serum is oniy mecessary for the earliest stage of fT cell activation will now enable studies designed to identify the critical individual serum components and to define  their mechanism of action.  Scrum ts considered one of the most essential compo- nents of any culture medium Supporting an optimal! rate of T cell proliferation, yet the effective motecules in se- rum and their respective functional roles have remained obscure. In part, the difficulties nherent in the Identift- cation of serum components critical for cell growth can be attributed to the complex nature of serum itself. How- ever. this difficulty has been compounded by a lack of understanding regarding the fundamental intraceltular motecular mechanisms responsible for progression through the separate stages of the cell cycle.

Lipids have also been assigned a nutritive function (5. 5S). although some investigators have found them Inhibitory for cell growth in vitro. especially for lectin-activated T cells (7. 8}. The role of insulin tn cell growth has never been clearly delineated. even though it ts the hormone  supplement utilized most frequently In the culture of cell lines adapted for growth in defined. serum-free medium (3). In contrast. it ts noteworthy that transferrin is the only serum component for which a mechanism of action has been defined (10. 11). Celt surféce transferrin recep- tors function to deliver tvansferrin-bownd iron into the Is required as a co-factor essential for the maximal activity of tbonucleotide reductase. a key en- zyme in nucleotide synthesis (22. 23). Serum aupplemen- tation thus serves to provide transferrin which facilitates the uptake of iron, a vital nutrient known to be required for a distinct stage {5) of the cell cycle. :  The localization of transferrin-bound iron as tmportant. for the S phase of the cell cycle Is consistent with its function as a co-factor necessary for DNA replication. in a similar manner. it would be advantageous to identify other phases of the T cell cycie where specific scnam components are required. Fortunately. it proved possible {© exploit the model system of T cell growth in which it has been established that two entirely separate mem- branc receptors promote advancement through the cett cycle (14-16). Stimulation of the T cell receptor complex Jnittates G, to G, transition. thereby rendering the cells “competent” by activating the transcription of at least two critical genes. one encoding interleukin 2 {IL 2) and the other. the IL 2 receptor (16). Subsequently. activated IL 2 receptors promote passage through the remainder of the G, phase to S (14. 1S). Thus. lymphocyte blastic transformation is actually the morphologic manifestation of IL 2 mediated G, progression (15). rather than a con- Sequence of T cell antigen receptor activation, as as-  035812  998  PUBLICATIONS  10355233 __label__Scientific

Researchers from the federal , Centers for Disease Contro) and Prevention reported that the per centage of women of childbearing age who had ever smoked declined le 3K.2 percent in 1996 from 44.1 percent in 1987. Additionally, the prevalence of current smo! ing de- clined to 11.8 percent in 1996 from 16.3 percent in 1987.  The results of the telephone sur- vey of 187,302 women aged 18 to 44 from 33 states appear in today’s issue of the Journal of the Ameri- van Medici sociation.  ‘The researchers, led by Dr. Sha- hul Ebrahim, said women who re- ported they were pregnant were about half as likely to be current smokers as women who weren't pregnant — a ratio that fluctuated only slightly over the 10-year sur- vey period.  TO: 19176635739  Wed January 19, 2000 Appears On Page A8 Circulation: 338,793  In 1987, 16.7 percent of the preg-  nant women reported being smok- ;  ers and 26.7 percent of the women _  who weren't pregnant said they *  smoked. By 1996, only 11-8 percent of the pregnant women smoked  and only 23.6 of women who,  weren't pregnant did.  “In this analysis, the decline in smoking over ime among pregnant women was primarily due to the overall decline in soioking initia~ tion. rates among women of child- bearing age, not to an increased rate of smoking cessation related to pregnancy," the researchers wrote.  ‘The researchers cautioned that because the survey had excluded women without telephones, women younger than 18 and these who did not live in private residences, they may have underestimated the actu- al prevalence of smoking.  1  PAGE: 6  ST.LOUIS POST DISPATCH __label__News

These  two pieces were never produced and thus the two mailings never. went out. Please make sure MFID tables reflect these changes. —  This change in strategy has resulted in mailing out the Reactiviation piece to all WWC members, with a few exceptions as detailed below. The Screener plece will not be used at all.  After making the changes noted below, you will need to maintain the original cell numbers identified in Alert 0074-C and create one new mailfile.  ow hw te ws 8 to Ss a Pr __label__Form

BLAKESLEE  NEW . YORK’ —(2)— A broad study seeking knowledge of whether cigarets or other forms of tobacco cause lung cancer or other health hazards was an- nounced Tuesday  It is the first announcement of a big research program head- ed by the scientific advisory board of the Tobacco Indus Research committee, .  IT WILL INCLUDE numer ous studies of humans, includ- ing emotional habits of smok- ers, as well as tests on animals.  Only the broad aspects of the Tesearch program were dis- closed yesterday. Specific re. search grants will be announced later. The board has $500,000 to work with.  “We will tackle simultane. ously many of the unknowns in this field of tobacco use in re- lation to human health,” said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar Harbor, Maine, chairman of the research board.  Cancer-Smoker Studies  NEW YORK, Oct. 19—GP— A broad six-point study seek- ing knowledge whether cigarets or other forms of tobacco cause lung cancer or other health  Statisticat studies and experi- menis recently linked smoking, especially cigarets, with a rapid rise in human lung cancer. Ciga- rets also have been charged with creating an ‘extra hazard of causing heart attacks,  BUT SOME sscienlisis. and physicians have said they are by no means convinced, or doubt there is any link.  Little’s board said it will co- ordinate research in these six gentral areas:  A study of human lung can- cer in 10 major medical centers in the United States and Can- ada, checking lungs for evi- dences of the sites and time of beginning of cancer.  Study of animals while inhal- ing smoke under controlled conditions, to see if there are effects on lung cancer, growth  rates, heart and blood vessels, and nervous tissues.  Study of the effect of known smoke tars, obtained under con- trolled conditions, on tissues of animals which naturally vary  in their susceptibility to cancer or other diseases.  Study of lung cardiovascular (heart-blood vessel) tissues in  living humans and animals.  Surveys of groups of people in various parts of the nation concerning characteristics of smokers. Age, sex, emotional habits, environmental factors as well as smoking histories will be analyzed.  Development of sources for & continuous supply of tobacco smoke and its deratives for use in a variety of experiments. Et. forts will be made to duplicate human smoke by machines.  hazards was announced Tues- day.  It is the first announcement of a big research program head- ed by the scientific advisory board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC).  It will include numerous studies of humans, including emotional habits of smokera, as well as tests on animals,  Only the main broad aspects of the research were disclosed. The specific research grants, fi-  maced by the TIRC, will be an- nounced later.  “We will tackle simultaneous- ly many of the unknowns in this field of tobacco use in re- lation to human health,” said Dr. Clarence Cook Little, Bar Harbor, Me., board chairman.  “We seek definitive findings in an area where much sug- gestive work has been done. The program recognizes we do not have today the experiment- al evidence that will permit scientific conclusions regarding the cause and effect relationship between environmental factors, including smoking, and lung cancer.”  One researcher who linked cancer with cigaret smoking, meanwhile, recommended that the cigaret industry try to pro- auce a “safe” cigaret, rather than undertake the “nearly im- possible task of proving con- clusively” whether smoking is a factor in cancer or heart disease.  He is Dr. E. Cuyler Ham- mond, statistical director of the American Cancer Society. Addressing the ACS annual meeting, he said there is “hope” of producing a “safe” cigaret. It will take far longer to define cigaret smoking’s effects on the body than fo produce a tobacco which can be shown to have less harmful effect on respira- tion and heartbeat, he said, __label__News

TOBACCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  July 7, 1999  TO: All Salaried Employees in Corporate, Research and Product Development and Field Sales  FROM: Ronald S$. Milstein, Vice President, General Couns RE: Retention of Records for Antitrust Lawsuit (Lorillard v.  Philip Morris)     Lorillard recently sued Philip Morris, Incorporated ("Philip Morris") in federal court in Greensboro, charging that Philip Morris is attempting to unlawfully monopolize the retail cigarette  market through its "Retail Leaders" merchandising program. horillard's lawsuit has been consolidated with similar suits brought  by R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson. Our lawsuit charges that Philip Morris' Retail Leaders program violates federal and state antitrust laws because it requires retailers to commit to exclusionary levels of display of Philip Morris brands, preventing Lorillard and other competitors from effectively displaying and advertising their brands. The judge in the case has issued a preliminary injunction that prevents Philip Morris from enforcing the more restrictive provisions of the Retail Leaders program. We expect that our suit will proceed to trial next spring.  As part of the pretrial proceedings, Philip Morris has served borillard with a request for documents, and we require your immediate assistance in helping the Company respond to this request. Please review this memo carefully, determine if you have any documents relating to the subjects set forth below, and segregate and retain all guch documents until further notice. You should then notify your supervisor and/or Jack Reilly, Associate General Counsel, Litigation (extension 7703) about the existence of such documents with an estimation of their volume (preferably by file drawer or box).

P -/3100 13 Jun. 94 KHO/RPE 3100_txt.doc Page 1  Ko  / /  OSHA claimes that “A correlation between nicotine absorption and exposure to tobacco smoke has been demonstrated, thus making nicotine an appropriate marker for tobacco smoke in pharmacokinetic studies” [59FR, 15974, April 5, 1994] and “It appears that the most effective strategy currently achievable would be to rely on nicotine (or cotinine) measurement as a specific marker of ETS exposure.” [59FR, 15998, April 5, 1994]. foe.  psu (SFR, 16008 ARS BBE Ada Sy y \ Nicotine as a specific marker of ETS exposure:  However, as stated by S.L. Schwartz et al. [S.L. Schwartz et al., 1993] “Nicotine or cotinine biomonitoring can provide, at best, only semiquantitative information about exposure, and has only limited ability to estimate dose, duration and time since termination of exposure’. Balter et al. go even further [Balter et al., 1988], “The predominance of nicotine in the ETS gas phase implies that nicotine is not a satisfactory marker for the particle phase and, perhaps, not for whole ETS per se”. A necessary condition for nicotine as a valid surrogate marker for ETS would be that in real life situations nicotine is present and can be detected with sufficient proportionality to other characteristic and biologically relevant constituents of environmental tobacco smoke. Analytical measurements, however, under defined and reproducible conditions suggest “that some components of environmental tobacco smoke are dominated by contributions from other sources in indoor environments (e.g., CO, and to a lesser extent NO, and particles). On the other hand nicotine and some other components of environmental tobacco smoke (e.g., myosmine) are found in indoor environments at concentrations lower than would be expected. This is due to specific loss of gas phase material by deposition to the surroundings’. [Balter et al., 1988 and references cited there]. According to Eatough et al. [Eatough et al., 1990] “Environmental tobacco smoke will be a constantly changing mixture due to loss of material as a result of adsorption or decomposition and due to changes in gas/particulate phase equilibria for volatile species” and “These changes ... may preclude the accurate measurement of human exposure to  specific compounds without actual measurement of the compounds of interest.”  Given these complications, OSHA has to provide a quantifiable relationship between the measured nicotine (or cotinine) levels and the ETS dose taken up. This relationship must specify  error limits in order to be applicable to safety procedures.  89TGE0Z902 __label__Scientific

In addition, the progress on further testing is detailed.  Background  A Newport 10's pack program was placed in stores in the South Bronx the week of 6/02 and in Detroit the week of 5/25. The 10's packs were placed in temporary displavs with p.o.s. support including 2 wide, 4 wide cards, shelf talkers and small posters.  The perceived benefit to consumers was an out-of-pocket cost advantage, thereby serving as a trial device for the Brand.  The South Bronx test area is a lower income area with a primarily Spanish population. RJR audits indicate a 9% S.O.M. for Newport box, second in share to Marlboro box. New York tax laws require a tax stamp on the 10's which was affixed by the jobber at a cost of $1.25 per thousand units. In this area 4 of the original 10 test stores were replaced due to excessive pilferage. This had resulted in our displays being removed from the counter by store owners.  . In Detroit, total Newport Green has a share of 4.60% (12 months through 9/82). Logistically, this test was easier as taxes are paid by the jobber off invoices. Fourteen stores were tracked in the Detroit panel. After July 23rd however, data on only 5 stores was tracked due to stores dropping from the panel and 1 store closing. °  SZ992408 __label__Memo
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  CAMEL SUMMER RESORT PROGRAM "SMOOTH MOVES" May 12, 1989  This executive summary serves as a synopsis of the 14 week CAMEL Summer Resort Program referred to as the "Smooth Moves". The Summer Program, to be executed on the Eastern Seaboard, will be somewhat similar to the successful Spring Resort (Daytona Beach) Program with minor revisions and improvements. It is anticipated that the "Smooth Moves" will perform 8 - 10 shows per week with exposure in approximately 10 - 14 markets (depending on final scheduling) that represent a significant concentration of targeted younger adult smokers. The following information serves as a reference guide to the elements integral in achieving successful CAMEL 1) brand exposure, 2) Smooth Character/Smooth Moves promotional campaign reinforcement, 3) extensive product trial sampling, and 4) effective promotional entertainment while targeting the younger adult smoker demographic (21 - 25 years of age).  1. "Smooth Moves" - Promotional Entertainment  The center of the Summer Resort Program will be a revised edition of the Spring Resort Program executed in Daytona Beach. Utilizing the talents of three attractive female entertainers and a fast - moving male emcee, the 45 minute live performance will consist of the highest quality pre-recorded music (or tracks), exciting choreography, stunning vocal stylings, and audience participation. The contemporary format includes recognizable popular Top 40 pop and dance music - music relative to the targeted audience and club attendee. Original lyrics add to the creative flavor of the performance while also supporting the "Smooth Moves" concept. Joe makes his crowd pleasing celebrity appearance in the show's finale.  2 Audience Participation  A. Dance Contest - At one point during the performance, couples (who are not "together") will be randomly chosen to participate in the onstage dance contest during which the couples are placed in ONE pair of boxer shorts - quite a unique dance style. The crowd chooses the winner and CAMEL prizes are rewarded to all participants.  a oO ~] MN fh Oo gi ~ @ __label__Report

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 87, pp. 6208-6212, August 1990 Biochemistry  Purification and partial characterization of a cellular inhibitor of the interferon-induced protein kinase of M, 68,000 from  influenza virus-infected cells  (protein kinase /influenza /eukaryotic initiation factor 2/translation, /interferon)  Tar Gvu Lee*, Jupy Tomira*, ARA G. HovaNesstANnt, AND MICHAEL G. Katze*t  *Department of Microbiology, School af Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; and “Unite d’Oncologie Virale, Institut Pasteur,  Paris 75724, France  Communicated by Edwin G. Krebs, May 21, 1990  ABSTRACT A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon- induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (re- ferred to as P68 based on its Af, of 68,000 in human cells). This control is essential because once activated, the P68 kinase phosphorylates its natural substrate, the a subunit of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), limiting functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 avail- able for protein synthesis initiation, We have previously shown that influenza virus encoded a specific mechanism to repress the autophosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitro assays for P68 inhibition, we now have purified, to near homogeneity, the P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected cells. The purified product inhibited both the autophosphory- lation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the a subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase. We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surpris- ingly we found the purified repressor, which had an apparent M, of ~58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein. Possible mechanisms by which influenza virus activates this cellular regulator of the protein kinase, thereby minimizing potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.     To avoid decreases in protein synthetic rates during infec- tion, animal viruses have devised strategies to downregulate activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA- activated protein kinase (referred to as P68 from its M, of 68,000 but also referred to by others as DAI or Pl/elP-2 kinase) (1-4). The P68, a serine/threonine kinase, is charac- terized by two distinct kinase activities: the first involves an autophosphorylation (activation) reaction, and the second involves a protein kinasc activity on exogenous substrates (5, 6). The virus-induced contro! of P68 is essential because viral-specific RNAs synthesized during infection have the potential to activate the P68 kinase (7-11). Once activated, P68 phosphorylates its natural substrate, the @ subunit of protein synthesis eukaryotic initiation factor 2, e1F-2. Phos- phorylation of the efF-2 a subunit blocks the ell*-2B- mediated exchange of GDP in the inactive eIF-2-GDP com- plex with GTP required for catalytic utilization of eLP-2 (12-14}, These events lead to limitations in functional elF-2, which is an essential component of protein synthesis initia- tion and is normally required to bind initiator Mct-tRNA (via the ternary complex eI F-2-GTP_-Met-tRNA) to the initiating ribosomal subunit before MRNA is bound (14).  The regulation of P68 is best understood in the adenovirus system primarily because of the characterization of the adenovirus mutant 4/331 (16). During infection by the di331  The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

In contrast to adenovirus, both reovirus and vac- cinia viruses appear to downregulate P68 by encoding gene products that may bind to and sequester the double-stranded RNA activator of the kinase (23-25). Poliovirus has devised yet another strategy to minimize the damaging effects of kinase activation: early after virus infection the kinase is significantly degraded (7). Finally, we recently have shown that the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 may mediate downregulation of the protein kinase via action of the raz gene product (26).  The first indication that influenza virus encoded mecha- nisms to regulate P68 came from studies analyzing cells doubly infected with influenza virus and the adenovirus mutant di331. When mutant di331-infected cells were super- infected with influenza virus, dramatic suppression of the protein kinase activity normally detected during mutant infection was observed (27). We then reported a similar suppression of kinase activity in cells infected by influenza virus alone (28). In the present report we describe the purification and characterization of an unusual P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected ceils. The inhibitor, which was purified by using in vitro P68 inhibition assays, was unex- pectedly found to be a cellular and not a viral protein.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cells and Virus. The Madin—Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (29) and the adenovirus type 5 human embryonic cell line 293 (30) were grown in monolayers as described (28). The WSN strain of influenza virus was grown and titrated as earlier described (29).  Purification of the P68 Inhibitor. Monolayers of MDBK cells (2 x 10" cells; 800 T150 flasks) were infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of ~10 plaque-forming units per cell for 4 hr. The infected cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution and lysed in buffer A: 50 mM Tris‘HCl, pH 7.5/50 mM KCI/1 mM dithiothreitol/2 mM MgCl./aprotinin at 100 zg per ml/1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1% Triton X-100. The cyto- plasmic extracts were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr in a Beckman Ti 70.1 rotor.

March 4, 1999 Tim (last) TO: T. J. Payne FROM: R. L. Mozingo  SUBJECT: Weekly Status Report - State Government Relations  Cigarette Excise Taxes  A House committee held a hearing on the Governor’s proposal to increase the Maryland cigarette excise tax by $1.00 per pack (36¢-$1.36). A full committee vote on the measure could be taken as early as March 5. Leadership of the House seems to be favoring an increase of 50¢ per pack in 1999 and 50¢ more in 2000.  The New Hampshire Senate Ways and Means Committee passed legislation raising the cigarette tax by 25¢ per pack (37¢-62¢). The full Senate is expected to give the bill a second reading and refer it to the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate is expected to hold the bill in the Finance Committee while the legislature debates other pieces of the education funding legislation.  The 6¢ per pack (21¢-27¢) excise tax bill in New Mexico passed the Senate and has been sent to the House. The Governor stated this week that he would veto any tax increase bill that came across his desk.  In Wyoming, the bill that removes the sales tax exemption from tobacco products passed the Senate.  MSA Legislation  The New Jersey Assembly Health Committee has scheduled hearings on two settlement- related bills - one to set up a Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund and another to require non- participating manufacturers to pay into a reserve fund.  A California Senate bill has been introduced to implement the “renegade” provisions of the MSA. A total of 12 bills have been introduced in the legislature that direct where money from the MSA might go, and four more bills were introduced to begin the battle over tax revenues raised from Proposition 10, the 50¢ per pack ballot initiative that passed in November.  Settlement related bills were also introduced in Connecticut and Vermont.     sees eacels __label__Letter

Cummings PON hte § _ RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  Following is an update on what has transpired concerning the Records Management Program in the Leaf Department since I last wrote to you in March.  On August 6, 1991, the second revised issue of the Leaf Department records retention schedule received the endorsements required for finalization. All copies of the two previously issued schedules should now be disposed. I was recently informed by Jane Newchok that one additional modification was still required. “However, since the requested change did not affect the maintenance or retention of records, I would prefer to postpone revising your schedule again until more critical changes are also needed. Our Records Management legal counsel has been made aware of this issue and agrees.  The record category "Blend Sheets B1082" was placed under disposal suspension by the Records Management legal counsel on July 23, 1991. These records have been flagged in the Records Management data base and should not appear on any disposal notices until the suspension has been released. I will let you know when this occurs.  This month, 14 employees in the Leaf department were trained on the final phase of the Records Management Program implementation. The diskettes to capture their inventory data were distributed during this training session. This month, I have started reporting their progress on this phase of implementation. Attached is a chart showing the information that will be reported monthly until this final phase of implementation has been completed. I hope this will assist you in continuing to monitor the progress of the Records Management Program implementation in the Leaf Department.  Reconciliation of inactive Leaf Department records in storage to your approved departmental retention schedule continued throughout this reporting period. I estimate this activity is about 802% complete. Based on the volume of Leaf records to be addressed, we plan to complete your department in October 1991. I will continue to inform you periodically of our progress.  The revised PM USA Records Management Manual has been approved by the Records Management Joint Task Force and the President of Philip Morris USA.

BY JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM Special to the Globe  BROOKLINE -~ It’s one thing for restaurants to have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections, says Bud Hyder. But to ban all smoking in bars, he said, is  “an outrage.”  “T don’t think it’s going to METRO work,” said Hyder, puffing on a DIARY pipe as he quaffed his beer at the Corrib Pub yesterday. “Drinking  ———--——=_ and smoking go together.” On Tuesday, Brookline’s town. meeting members approved the most comprehensive smoking ban in the        staté, one that will make it illegal to smoke in all town  restaurants, bars and taxicabs, Unless state legisla- tors can intervene ~ as some are attempting to do ~  the law will take effect in July, and violators will fa  $50 fines.  ” At the Corrib Pub, a high-spirited Irish bar and restaurant with a tight crowd of regulars, the new law drew a firestorm of criticism. In an age when smokers routinely receive nasty glances and comments on the street, patrons said they viewed ‘bars like the Corrih as a last refuge.  “I don’t even smoke that much, and I don't agree with this,” said Vie Jackson, a former Brookline resi- dent who now delivers meals on wheels in the town.  Sitting beside’ Jackson was his friend Bob Var- num, who also had harsh words for the ban. “I don’t like what's going on with this town - it’s too liberal,” said Varnum, a Brookline police officer who smokes,  2     SI ete Sieh that when”  the regulations are in force, they: will take their bust: ness elsewhere.  . “I won't come here,” said’ Danny Hagerty, St, 8 a.  : custodian with the Brookline School Department, who           GLOBE STAFF PHOTO/ FRANK O'BRIEN  Brookline School Department employee Danny Hagerty has a smoke with his drink at Corrib.  said he could just as easily spend his lunch break _ down the street in Allston, “If you have a beer, you've " got to have at least two smokes with it.” Even some nonsmokers were upset.

Breakouts included in this report are as follows:  Markets - each Lorillard Area, Region and Division as well as Total U.S. Items - Industry, key segments, and companies by brand  Data reported for all items in each market - % of U.S. volume - share of market - share point change vs. year ago - share development indices (SDI's) versus U.S. levels  Following is a brief summary of full price versus discount trends by key brands and Areas.  EULL.PRICE/BRANDS  Full Price share continues to grow in all Areas with increases ranging from +1.42 points or +2% in the segment's strongest Northeast Area (78.33 SOM) to +2.60 points or +4% in the Southwest Area where its share is lowest (65.10).  In total, the top six Full Price brands--Marlboro, Newport, Winston, Camel, Salem, and Kool -- account for 77% of the category's sales. Of the six, Marlboro (31.93 SOM) is, by far, the most important and is showing the greatest absolute share growth in all Areas with gains ranging from +],58 point in the Northeast to +2.91 points in the Southwest.

H KBL33U0S83 July i 1P 82  Afbbcation ft i4yy  peterres For ssfe Wiel Abel lee  Critique of Busbee Application  The staff, Dv, Brennan and I met Dr. Busbee during the meeting of the CTR in June 1982 where he presented  his data.  In principle, the work is concerned with the transport of aromatic hydrocarbons (H3) carcinogen by serum components. In addition, the importance of binding  of lipofilic carcinogens by lipoproteins and their uptake is being explored. It was therefore logical for Dr. Busbee to suggest a correlation between LP and the action of carcinogens. Not, Oo logical is his invocation of carcinogen-initiated hypeplastic growth of cells and human atherosclerosis. In this connection he quotes (in reference 7) Benditt, who has demonstrated the tumor-like growth of smooth muscle cells, but who never  mentioned any connection with lipofilic carcinogens. This connection is most tenuous.  It is also natural for Dr. Busbee to invoke the work of Goldstein on LDL receptors.  He attempts to demonstrate the close connection between  transport of carcinogen (PAH) by lipoproteins; and the initiation of DNA synthesis in treated cells.  TECHNIQUE:  The lipoprotein preparation is quite interesting because he uses a method which he claims is new and more simple than others and that is the TSK-250 column which originated  in Japan. I have no experience with this column, since  most peonle use differential ultra-centrifugation or heparin- Manganese methods. The binding of LDL with benzopyrene  which is labeled is investigated. A further step, of course, is the binding of carcinogens to cellular components. He uses human lymphocytes in this connection.  The last step is an investigation of carcinogen binding of lymphocytes to DNA, and the incorporation of tritiated thinidin into lymphocytes.  In principle, therefore, the investigation consists in isolation of low density lipoprotein, demonstration of binding of the carcinogen and the effect of this binding complex to the uptake and effect on DNA synthesis in the cell. __label__Report

Mr. J. O.     April 27, 1972  Watson  Re: WINSTON BRAND GROUP AND MRD SALES PROMOTION PLANNING MEETING  To recap our meeting of Monday, April 17, 1972, here is a summary of the topics covered:  1. Change in Marketing Objectives of WINSTON Promotions - Primarily due to the high level of smoker trial, WINSTON  already enjoys (about 70% of all smokers), "attainment of competitive trial" has now been given secondary status.  In its place as primary objectives are now:  a.  b.  Achieve visibility for the Brand at point-of-sale, and  Reinforce the Brand's major selling points to consumers at point-of-sale. In addition,  "Reward current smokers of WINSTON" remains a primary promotion objective.  2. Review of Current Promotions -  a.  b.  ae of  Hi-Lo Baseball Sweepstakes Promotion Evaluation Report -? (MRD # 71-0221). The report on this promotion  has been released.  WINSTON Menthol 50¢ Coupon Direct Mail Test (MRD #71-0476) oe  The research currently being completed on this offer appears to be sufficient: redemption analysis, sales  analysis, and consumer follow-up to determine competitive trial and demographic composition.  "Real-Rich-Cool" Negro Sweepstakes (MRD # 72-0230) ow  The research currently under way appears sufficient: on redemption analysis and an estimate of the multiple entry rate.  There was some discussion on the need for research into why "scaled down" promotions which are aimed at specific market segments seem to attract fewer participants with a higher cost per entry. Several alternatives were suggested: ,  i. Ballot testing ii. Focus group sessions iii. Experimental techniques for identifying  which one - of several - alternative sweepstakes smokers would prefer to enter.  wn ° ~ tl N a - Wn N __label__Report

4/14/88 CU:. DRS. JACOBSON ,GLENN,SOMMERS SCIENTIFIC STAFF  February 24, 1988  GRANT APPLICATION NO. 2284  Joseph D. Fenstermacher, Ph.D., State University of New York  Dr. Fenstermacher a professor of physiology and biophysics in Stonybrook, New York, is interested in experiments on the rat to’ determine and relate local cerebral blood flow and correlate it with local glucose utilization. He divided his goals in a whole series of subdivisions, and hypotheses. These hypotheses are related to the effect of nicotine on both cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization. For that purpose two experimental series of rats will be used, control and those with nicotine exposure. All methods are highly jndirect. For example, he will use quantitative autoradiography, in which the optical density is related to the radioactivity from standard data, he will use light microscopy in order to study morphometry. Blood flow will be measured with 14C iodoantipyrine. He seems to believe quite firmly in the idea that there is recruitment of blood vessels in the brain, a fact which has never been verified by direct observations. He also thinks that with this methodology he is able to determine volume of perfused microvessels. Despite a multiplicity of specific aims and hypotheses, it really boils down to a correlation between local blood flow and local glucose utilization.  Since all methods are indirect, they are beset with a difficulty of drawing conclusion which are very involved and difficult to substantiate. For example, quantitative autoradiography, iodoanti- pyrine measurement of surface area and permeability products all these  are highly speculative. __label__Scientific

MEMORANDUM  April 25, 1991  TO: J.R. Cherry af t A |  FROM:  N. sinonseie |  RE: New York City Sampling Ordinance and Newport Proposal NL?     Newport proposes a distribution of cigarette samples within New York City at an “attractive price above cost." I have looked at Local Law 27 of 1990 of the City of New York to determine the answer to the following question: whether the general prohibition contained therein against distributing free  samples of tobacco products would extend to distributions at an "attractive price above cost?"  Local Law 27 of 1990 provides the following:  "Distribution of tobacco products to the general public at less than basic cost prohibited in public places and  at public events. No person shall distribute a tobacco product for commercial purposes at less than the basic cost of such product to members of the general public  in public places or at public events."  Administrative Code of the City of New York § 17-176(b).  There are some exceptions to the prohibition which are not of immediate concern here and which have been addressed elsewhere. I will concentrate, therefore, on the cost issue.  The code defines "less than basic cost" as meaning ", . . free of charge, a nominal or discount price, or any other price less than the distributor’s cost, to which shall be added the full value of any stamps or taxes which may be required by law..."  Ibid, at §17-176(a) (2).  yL9acele __label__Memo

—- io = i ‘ nan Sa we ve ae Le - VO). can ot SUBJECT: LNA Consumer Tests DATE: April 21, 1989 TO: Dr. M. E. Stowe FROM: J. P. Dickerson  I recommend cancellation of the consumer test for Project LNA-10P, scheduled for a 7/31/89 mailout. The LNA-LOV product, which is being mailed for consumer testing 5/22/89, meets our original objective of obtaining consumer test data on a "no-nicotine" protocept. The LNA-1OV product has a blend nicotine of 0.11% and a smoke nicotine yield of 0.05 mg/cigarette. Although our blend nicotine is 0.11% as compared to 0.05-0.06% in Merit Free  and Next, smoke nicotine in this product is 0.05 mg/cigarette as compared to 0.06 in Merit Free and Next.  The low nicotine in LNA-10V was obtained through conventional denicotinization of low nicotine tobaccos. Our approach to the LNA-10P product is based on removal of nicotine by a water extraction process. In  theory, the LNA-10P approach will give approximately the same nicotine value as the LNA-10V approach, using tobacco blends in inventory.  If we do proceed with the 7/31/89 consumer test, we will be comparing the water extraction process with conventional denicotinization. Comparison  of the two processes at best has limited value since the approach to water extraction is being changed significantly.  Eliminating the proposed consumer test would allow Advanced Process Technology to concentrate their effort on the water extraction process that  would be used in a production facility rather than diverting resources to producing material for one consumer test.  I recommend that we continue to evaluate the water extracted material we have on hand and continue to develop low nicotine formulations from the materials produced by Advanced Process Technology. However, I feel that we  should delay any consumer tests related to LNA-10P until we have done a more thorough job of process and formulation development.  9.0 Mca  . J. P.

Philip Morris U.S.A. PRIORITY  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTEROFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Ashland, Virginia To: K.S. Houghton / A.C. Lilly / LR. Nelson Date: March 24, 1995  From: J.A. Carboni Subject: Bi-weekly Summary Heater / Lighter Development:  Heater Development:  * PM 50 and PM 80 were received and tested for heater creep. We saw no significant improvement of mechanical stability under heating. ORNL is looking into their ability to enhance the stability by heat treating. In addition, we are trying our own tests using ovens available at R&D.  * An alternative strategy to increasing the strength of the heater material, at elevated temperatures, is to investigate the feasibility of lowering the heater operating temperature (creep is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature) while maintaining the required heat transfer to the cigarette (thus maintaining subjective character). We have identified the required energy profile to attain a constant temperature for a given heater. This energy profile will be tested for subjective impact once the virtual lighter is complete.  * Ceramx sleeve testing is in progress. The sleeves are functioning as expected.  ¢ We have received carbon-impregnated acetate sleeves from AFC. These will be used to assess the replaceable condensate control system.  Lighter Development:  ¢ Fifteen lighters were brought back from Sanyo. Some minor problems with heater shorts and flow sensors occurred. These are now being corrected. All heaters will be disassembled and flow tubes reversed to improve subjectives. During the disassembly the heaters will be inspected for potential shorts and fixed as needed.  * The BFL (Big Flexible Lighter) now has the capability of monitoring heater profile. We are developing the ability to modulate the energy to the heater.  Energy Storage:  * A simple simulation of heater temperature dynamics has been initiated using a commercial software package. With it's use, results of using various power modulation schemes can be easily visualized. Incorporation of a more rigorous heater model from A. D. Little into the simulation is being pursued.

No, 0007  The Developmentally Restricted Pattern of  Expression in the Male Germ  Line of a Murine  Cyclin A, Cyclin A2, Suggests Roles in Both Mitotic and Meiotic Cell Cycles  Stuart E. Ravnik*t and Debra J. Wolgemuth*++§"  Departments of “Genetics and Development and tObstetrics and Gynecology, tThe Cv  er for     Reproductive Sciences, and §The Columbia Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, 630 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032  We have isolated cDNAs encoding a murine cyclin A, designated cyclinA2, and have examined its in vivo expression at  the level of both mRNA and protein, with particular focus on the male germ line. in a variety of adult tissues, including the testis. In the testis, however,  Cyclin A2 is expressed in embryos and a striking cellular specificity of expression was  observed. At both the DNA and protein levels, the predominant sites of cyclin A2 expression were in the germ line stem cells, the spermatogonia, and in highest levels in preleptotene spermatocytes, cells in which premeiotic DNA synthesis oceurs. The concurrent localization of cyclin A2 MRNA and protein further suggested that cyclin A2 is regulated at the level of transcription in these cells. The observed cellular specificity of cyclin A2 expression is consistent with its function during mitosis in the stem cell stage of this lineage, while the restricted meiotic stage localization suggests function in  G1/S or 5 but not in the meiotic divisions per se.  9 1996 Academic Press, Inc,     INTRODUCTION  The mitotic and meiotic divisions of mammalian germ cells are particularly amenable for study during spermato- genesis. In the female germ line, many of these events take place in the embryo and meiosis is interrupted until after puberty. In contrast, in the male germ line, mitotic prolifer- ation of spermatogonia, the initiation of the meiotic cell cycle, the meiotic divisions, and the production of haploid spermatozoa take place, continuously and unintermpted, in the adult testis. Analysis of germ cell development in rhe male is therefore an excellent system to study both mitotic and meiotic cell cycles in vivo as well as the mechanisms that control regulatory checkpoints that are distinct be- tween the male and female germ line.  Identification of many of the gene products involved in controlling mitotic and meiotic cell cycles of several model organisms has greatly facilitated our understanding of cell cycle regulation. Key among these is a serine/threonine pro-  'To whom correspondence should be addressed. Fax: 212-305- 6084,  0012-1606/96 $12.00 Capyright © 1996 by Academic Press, Inc.

The A- type cyclins were originally thought to function at mitosis, similar to the B-type cyclins (Norbury and Nurse, 1992; Lewin, 1990). However, cyclin A is synthesized and de- stroyed earlier in the cell cycle than cyclin B (Kobayashi et al, 1991; Hunt et al., 1992} and cyclin A accumulates in the nucleus immediately after its synthesis (Pines and Hunter, 1991; Girard et al., 1991, Pagano et al, 1992}.

Souillavrd  MEMORANDUM pecember 28, 1989  _ December     TO: gd. H. Bell FROM: E-Chung Wu  SUBJECT: A Review on the study of Reducing Mutagenicity of Tars Generated from Various Materiais ~     since July 25, we have performed more than 100 experiments. A summary of the results is attached in Appendix A- We found that there are two ways to reduce the mutagenicity of tar generated either from pyrolysis or smoking: By lowering the pyrolysis/- _gmoking temperature or by diluting highly mutagenic tar with low mutagenic tar.  ap ianernts  The progress of our study can be divided into two stages. The  first stage is a series of preliminary tests which were carried  out in the experiments from run #1 to run #16. We used #1580 tobacco (1) as the testing sample and pyrolyzed it at various temperatures and flow rates. The Ames test was used to detect  fee the mutagenic activity of tar- phis set of data, as discussed in * the previous report (2). shows that the mutagenicity of tar increases with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (Figure 1)- It also shows that the flow yate has 4 certain degree of effect on. the matagenicity of tar due to the fact that the compound (s)}  responsible for the activity is(are} low volatile (Figure 2).     The next stage is a series of screening tests of some pasic materials and the mixtures of these materials with other additives. The results of those basic materials are listed in Table 1. The relative values used in this table are pased on the value of  #1580 tobacco, which is assigned as 100. The reason to use a relative value is that, from time to time, the reproducibility of the experiments is not quite good probably due to the biological uncertainty as shown in Appendix A, column 9- #1580 is thus used as an internal reference.  From Table 1, we found that the tar from Whatman #42 filter paper (w42), 4.e., pure alpha-cellulose, nas wirtually no mutagenic activity while the tar from Burley stems {BYST) has very high activity, about 70% higher than that of the #1580 tobacco. rt pyst is thoroughly washed, the mutagenicity drops to 14% of  the unwashed one- Burley tobacco has the next highest activity, about 40% higher than that of #1580 tobacco. The mutagenicity of tar from flue-cured tobacco is about 30% less than that of #1580. The reconstituted leaf from Kimberly-Clark (KCRL) has approxi-  mately the same activity as gisso. if the black water is not  GEPSZELS  N o oo N. ~ _ N a =~ > __label__Memo

However, the major benefit for me was  their overall positioning guidance - what to communicate and 7 (especially) what not to communicate.     We are moving very, very fast. And as we move forward over the next several months we will all stay open to modifying these early positioning thoughts. However, for now this  positioning gives us the necessary focus against which to make changes.  Positioning Thoughts  What Helps - 1. Every group has voiced surprise, "shock" at how good the product tastes. Of course we'll make final  determinations and modifications based on product testing. But this reaction is sure nice to see.  2. Thirty cigarettes (10 extra, pack and a half) is very positive to many respondents. - While taste is important  ("ten extra what"), this added quantity is our uniqueness, and will be very important to trial.  3. Good taste and low tar is an important, unsatisfied need for many smokers. Relative to Carolina 30's, we  particularly saw this in the second session yesterday.  4. Although not explicitly probed, the brand name Carolina 30's seems to work well. I believe it brings  assurance, credibility and good taste overtones to this new brand.  QTESECTS __label__Memo

The Washington Times     FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1994 OP-ED           Dr. Elders attacks the demon weed  Surgeon General of the United  States, did not castrate her hus- band ortry to cripple an Olympic ath- lete. Had she done so, the press con- ference she held last week to announce yet another escalation in the federal war against smoking and indeed against the demon weed in all its forms might have enjoyed some momentary notice in the nation’s press. As it is, however, all Dr. Elders threatens to do is strip the country of yet another level of liberty, and that seems not to be worthy of much pub- lic attention.  That’s a shame, because of all the wacky animals in the Clinton zoo, Dr. Elders is surely the wackiest, and whatever she says is sure to split a rib. Her nutty comments  IE too bad that Dr. Joyce Elders,     The irony of this gala unveiling is that it comes from the same woman who has just counseled the legalization of real drugs. .  rival even those of Vice President Al Gore, who has run the gamut of boobism from his tour of Thomas Jefferson’s home at Monticello last year, when he was unable to identi- fy a bust of the third President of the United States, to his mistranslation a couple of weeks ago of the motto “FE Pluribus Unum” on the Great Seal. Mr. Gore thinks the Latin expression means “From One, Many,” though in fact it means the exact opposite, “From Many, One.”  Yet so far Mr. Gore’s bloopers, unlike those for which Dr. Elders has become notorious, have not endan- gered liberty and public decency. Only last month, the Surgeon Gener- al earned a rebuke from the zoo mas- ter-in-chief himself when she rumi- nated on the virtues of legalizing drugs. But last week she preached on the evils of tobacco, and perhaps the highlight of her sermon was her deathless insight that “Any form of tobacco. — smoked, chewed, spit or inhaled — is lethal.”     Samuel Francis, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndi- cated. His column appears here Tues- day and Friday.     That, of course, is simply non- sense. There are untold millions of people who smoke, chew or inhale tobacco and don’t die from it. There are people who use tobacco a lit- tle. There are peo- ple who use it fora while and give it up. There even are people who smoke it heavily for decades and die quietly at 93 when they fall down the kitchen  “4  Samuel stairs. For none of . these peopie is the Francis use of tobacco “lethal” or even  harmful.  The purpose of the press confer- ence was to arouse a somnolent citi- zenry to action, and it was only a pre- lude to the surgeon general’s forthcoming magnum opus on smok- ing, due in February. While Dr. Elders was blasting the tobacco industry, ex-President Jimmy Carter, whom Dr. Elders dragged forth as an ornament for her performance, urged a $2-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes to help keep “3,000 chil- dren from trying cigarettes for the first time each day” Whenever you hear the word “children? you should quietly rip the cellophane on your pack of Chesterfields.  Then Dr. Antonia Novello, Sur- geon General under President Bush, unbosomed the bizarre sentiment that tobacco is “the least regulated consumer product” in the country.  But it’s already illegal in most states for minors to buy tobacco prod- ucts, and smoking is banned in all air- planes and many airports, restau- rants, malls and public buildings, on top of outlawed cigarette advertising on TV and radio, compulsory warning labels and taxes that are already pro- hibitive. For Dr. Novello to pronounce that tobacco is “the least regulated” product in the country is — once again — an outright lie.  The plan is to push for virtual prohibition of tobacco by the year 2000, and the Coalition on Smoking or Health, which also bellied up to the Surgeon General’s pulpit last week, had the details. The Food and Drug Administration should ban the claims that low-tar and low- nicotine cigarettes are less danger- ous than the good stuff. The Feder- al Trade Commission should ban ‘Joe Camel” ads that supposedly entice children to smoke. The Transportation Department should make international flights smoke-  less. Congress should impose the $2-a-pack tax’and give the FDA full authority to regulate all tobacco products, and so on.  The irony of this gala unveiling of yet another therapeutic war to be waged by the federal leviathan is that it comes from the same woman who has just counseled the legalization of  real drugs. Since Dr. Elders’ own son |!  is facing felony drug charges and her husband owns a house in Little Rock notorious as the hang-out of a whole- some collection of youths known as the “8 Ball Posse,” suspected of drug- dealing themselves, it ought to strike most Americans as just a bit ripe for this sanctimonious loudmouth to blus- ter lies and banalities about tobacco even as she croons the virtues of legalizing dangerous substances.  But then, the American ruling class has never been known to stint itself in the pursuit of other peoples’ vices, especially when there’s power to be had in the chase. If nothing else, Dr. Elders’ unnoticed press conference was a pure specimen of what that class is up to and how it plans to achieve it — unless the citizens can tear themselves away from Lorena Bobbitt and Tonya Harding long enough to protect what remains of their freedom.  gGzegegrog __label__News

Acute Intermittent Porphyria: Characterization of a Novel Mutation in the Structural Gene for Porphobilinogen Deaminase Demonstration of Noncatalytic Enzyme Intermediates Stabilized by Bound Substrate  Robert J. Desnick, Ludmila T. Ostasiewicz, Peter A. Tishler, and Pertti Mustajoki Division of Medical Genetics, Mount Sinat School of Medicine, New York 10024: Veterans Admunstration Medical Center, Brockion- West Roxbury, Massachusers 02402 and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02143; and Third Depariment of Medicine.  Cnwwersity of Heisink!, 00290 Hetsuiki, Finland  Abstract  To investigate the molecular pathology in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the nature of the defective porphobilinogen (PBG)-deaminase was determined in erythrocyte iysates from 165 AIP heterozygotes from 92 unrelated families representing 20 different ethnic or demographic groups. Immunologic and physicokinetic studies revealed the occurrence of four classes uf PBG-deaminase mutations. In the majority of families studied, the amount of immunoreactive enzyme protein curre- sponded to the amount of enzymatic activity, indicating the absence of cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) pro- duced by the mutant allele, In 78 of these CRIM-negative families (designated type 1), the affected heterozygotes had half-normal PBG-deaminase activity. In three families (desig- nated CRIM-negative type 2). symptomatic patients had in- creased urinary excretion of §-aminolevulinic acid and PBG, and normal levels of erythrocyte PBG-deaminase activity. In coutrast, noncatalytic, immunoreactive protein was expressed in heterozygotes from [ft families, about one-eighth of those studied, consistent with mutations in the structural gene for PBG-deaminase, Two types of CRIM-positive mutations were identified: the type | mutation had a CRIM /activity ratio of ~ 1.7 and a crossed-immunoelectrophoretic profite in which all the enzyme intermediates were increased, with the B or mono- pyrrole-enzyme intermediate predominant (B > A > C ~ D >E). The mutation altered both the kinetic and stability Properties of the noncatalytic immunoreactive enzyme protein. The second CRIM-positive mutation, type 2, had markedly increased levels of noncatalytic immunoreactive protein (CRINI/ activity ratio ~ 5.7), Crossed-immunoelectrophoresis revealed markedly increased amounts of the substrate-bound interme- diates, B, C, D, and E(B > € > D> E® A). The accumulation of these noncatalytic enzyme intermediates presumably resulted from the enhanced binding and/or defective release of substrate malecules. Lhe conformation of these enzyme—substrate inter- mediates apparently rendered the complexes more resistant to intraerythrocyte proteolysis, These findings provide evidence for the presence of different allelic mutations in the structural gene for PBG-deaminase and document molecular genetic heterogeneity in AIP.

Inc. 002 1-9738/85/08/0865/10 $1.00 Volume 76, August 1985, 865-874  Introduction  Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a dominantly inherited inborn error of heme biosynthesis that results from the half. normal activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-deaminase: EC 4.3.1.8) (1-4). Clinical expression of the disease is highly variable, determined in part by environmental. metabotic, and hormonal factors that induce hepatic 4-aminolevulinie acid synthase activity and the subsequent increased production of heme precursors (5-7), Although the disease is clinically latent in many heterozygous individuals, those who are symptomatic usually have elevated levels of urinary PBG and its precursor. d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), particularly during acute attacks. Most affected individuals can be diagnosed enzymatically (i.¢.. decreased erythrocyte PBG-deaminase activity): however, kindreds have heen desenbed recently in which symptomatic patients have normai levels of the ervthroeyvte PBG-deaminase activity and markedly elevated urinary PBG and ALA levels (8. 9),  PBG-deaminase is encoded by a structural gene located on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (1ig23 — I1gter) (10). The ervthrocvte enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and its physicokinetie praperties have been char- acterized (11). The active enzyme protein is a monomer (Mf, ~ 42.000) that catalyzes the sequential head to tail conden- sation of four molecules of PBG to form hydroxymethyibilane. a linear tetrapyrrole that nonenzymaticalty cyclizes to uropor- phyrinogen LE. Hydroxymethytbilane is synthesized by a reaction mechanism involving the stepwise formation of stable enzyme- substrate intermediates (11-13), Five enzyme intermediates, A-E, have been identified by chromatographic and electropho- retic techniques, the A form being the ree enzyme and the B. C.D. and E forms representing the mano-. di-, tri-, and tetra- pyrrole substrate-enzyme intermediates, respectively (11, 14). The overall Aj, for the reaction was 6 «M and kinetic studies indicated that the C intermediate, the dipyrrale-enzyme com- plex, was either the most stable intermediate or the rate- limiting step in the conversion of the monopyrrole to the tetrapyrrole (11, 14).  In a previous communication. we reported the first im- munologic characterization of the enzymatic defect in unrelated heterozygotes with AIP (14). Monospccitic anti-human PBG- deaminase antibodies. which uniformly recognized each of the enzyme untermediates, were used to quantitate and characterize the amount of PBG-deaminase cross-reacting immunologic  1, Abbreviations used in this paper: AIP. acute intermittent parphyria: ALA, é-aminolevulinic acid; CRIM. cross-reacting immunologic ma- terial: DTT, dithiothreitol: PBG, porphobitinogen.

Over the past couple of months, many travelers have been faced for the first time with a controversial and temporary new federal law. It bans smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. One airline, Northwest, has gone further, banning smoking on all of its North American flights. While this law is being “tested” until April of 1990, some anti-smokers are pushing for an all-out airline smoking ban, and for removal of smoking sections in  airport terminals. After several months’ experience, there has  been a clear respense.  Smokers and nonsmokers alike have questioned why a change was made when the system of providing smoking and nonsmoking sections on planes satisfied just about everyone. According to federal records, complaints about smoking amounted to about one for every million air travelers over the last several years. Public opinion polls told the same story -- over 80 percent of both  smokers and nonsmokers thought that separate sections were a fair  way to accommodate everyone.  Proponents of the change disregarded the fact that since 1971, five major in-flight tests by both federal and private researchers have concluded that the amount of cigarette smoke detected in actual commercial flights is negligible, posing no demonstrated risk to nonsmoking passengers or flight personnel.

Rationale  Without going into deep specifics, the reasoning in support of my recommendation is:  a.  nen tanner ea ee  Phoenix and Tucson are separate media buys, hence, no reason to include Tucson from a  media purchase standpoint.  As Jack Grossman pointed out in his document to you on 9/1, the markets are extremely similar with regard to demographic makeup; hence, what problems/opportunities we identify demographically for Phoenix should be trans-  ferable to the Tucson market.  - Both markets are growing at an, above- average rate -- 30%+ last 10 years.  ~- Both are nearly identical in % popula- tion under 35: Phoenix 59.9%, Tucson  59.1%.  - Both have equal splits as to males/ females: Phoenix 49% to 51%, Tucson  49% to 513%.  - Both are equally similar as to house- hold income: in the $10,000-$20,000 range, Phoenix 41%, Tucson 39%.  ~ Both are very similar as to educational attainment. __label__Letter

Maddrey, Office Manager, and Mr. Gray N.  Leinbach, Assistant Office Manager.  The operations of the Advertising Department lie along two general  lines. First, this Department must keep in constant touch with every  phase of your Company’s national advertising program—seeing that it follows plans made far in advance, verifying all invoices for payment, and  making sure the costs of the program stay within the advertising budget  authorized. Second, it is the responsibility of this Department to prepare shipping  instructions for all advertising and merchandising materials needed by the  Company’s Sales Representatives in the field. National advertising of the Company’s products is one of the most  important phases of its business. It is true that superior quality is in  itself the best advertisement for any product.

GRAY AND COMPANY  JOHN BERARD VICE PRESIDENT  October 4, 1984  Mr. William D. Toohey, Jr. The Tobacco Institute  1875 I Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20006  Dear Bill:  The perspective (and follow-up) afforded by a week seems sufficient for reporting, though not finally, on the results of our effort last Tuesday at the National Press Club and the announcement of "Helping Youth Decide."  The event was, as you know, preceded by a week-long period of =>, “background briefings” with key media. The coverage based upon:;. - these briefings, the event itself and follow-up fall into two f° broad categories. These are Print and Electronic.       On the print side, we have verified the following:  The Lowell (Massachusetts) Sun ran the story. Copy to come. The reporter was Tom Squitieri.  Gannett News Service -- serving 86 newspapers in 37 states -- ran the piece. The reporter was Pat Ordovensky.  Scripps-Howard -~ serving over 60 newspapers out of the Washington bureau -- filed the story. Ken Eskey is the reporter. A copy of this one has already been forwarded to your attention.  USA Today ran with the story on the day of the event. As you know from my backtracking, the eventual three-line item which appeared in the National News section that day was culled from a larger, more comprehensive piece done for the Life section by reporter Barbara Zigli. The piece was deemed more national than lifestyle news by the Life section editors and it was shipped to National where it was snipped by Julia Wallace who is a national news editor. No follow-up by USA Today is planned, although Life editor Linda Kauss wants to see updates on program acceptance, usage, etc.  (more)  TINY 0011257 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL  THE POWER HOUSE WASHINGTON, D.C. 20007-3614 TLX: 440143 GRAY Ul  202-333-7400 TWX: 710-822-9282 GRAY CO WSH __label__Letter

- . PROJECT MX QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ° (MDD #86-42903)     The purpose of this report is to present findings from recent MX product qualitative research. . .  BACKGROUND:  Project MX is a tobacco-filtered cigarette developed to appeal to male, non-menthol smokers. Initial qualitative research on 14mg conventional blend products was conducted among FF smokers. This research indicated a problem with. too much impact.  As a result of this learning, R&D developed three reduced nicotine blends and two variations of the shredded tobacco filter:  o Blends  - Control-Conventional, high nicotine (A)  - Low nicotine (B) ~ Low nicotine with vanillin and chocolate in top dressing (C)  - Low nicotine with increased air dilution (H)  o Filter Variations     - All-tobacco filter ~ Combination filter: 15mm tobacco/l0mm cellulose acetate  -- Control-Cellulose acetate at mouth end (G) -- Tobacco filter at mouth end (F)  These prototypes were examined to aid R&D in determining blend, casing and top dressing direction for future quantitative testing.  METHODOLOGY:  Four focus groups were held on August 4-5, 1986 in Atlanta, Georgia. The all male groups were split on the basis of age (18-34, 35-49) and flavor grouping (FF, FFLT). All the respondents smoked 85mm, non-menthol brand styles.  Each group was initially exposed to a cigarette with the combination filter (G). Since the cellulose acetate portion was at the mouth end, this enabled us to obtain consumer perceptions of what looked to be a standard product. Smokers were then shown the tobacco filter concept (see attachment) without product. Following their comments on the concept itself and their expecta~ tions of the product, they were given a cigarette identical to the first with the exception that the tobacco portion of the combination filter was at the mouth end. This was followed by exposure to other prototypes with an all- tobacco filter. In addition, smokers were able to visually compare two colors  of the all-tobacco filter.     6800 7090S __label__Report

1.  WINSTON Family Copy Strategy and Platform  Copy Strategy  WINSTON's copy must convince Virile Segment smokers that WINSTON is a superior family of products smoked by emulatable, cut-above, rugged, contemporary, achievement-oriented men  who take great pride in themselves, their practical "hands-on" skills and abilities, the active lifestyles they lead, and the traditional American values and loyalties they share  with their peers. These men possess the distinctive form  of masculinity which enables them to work and interact effectively with their peers, contributing their personal  best in the pursuit of tasks and endeavors which require a high degree of teamwork, trust, loyalty and commitment,  and which result in a strong “bond of honor" or "Esprit de Corps" between these men. Secondarily, the Brand must proudly establish the perception that WINSTON delivers  smooth rich taste which is the best taste available, regard- less of length or tar level preference.  Copy Platform  A. Focus of Sale  The.WINSTON Family of Brands are superior products which are smoked by emulatable, cut-above, rugged, con- temporary, achievement-oriented men who take great pride in themselves, their practical, "hands-on" skilis and abilities, the active lifestyles they lead, and who possess a distinctive form of masculinity characterized by the loyalties and intense bonds of mutual respect, trust, and friendship they share with their peers.  B. Prime Prospect  Demographically described as males age 18-34 (emphasis  on 25-34) with an average education, but not a professional degree, who are the core of America's work force, both blue and white collar. Psychographically defined as  those males who have reached a stage of psychological maturity where their values are fairly well established;  they are sure of their masculinity, self-confident, achievement-oriented and take great pride in expressing and sharing these values with their peers,  \  ur Qo wr £ = f o 7 N __label__Report

1)  2)     MORE SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES REPORT Week of 2/25/85     The Brand attended focus groups in Orlando in order to obtain general consumer information which will be used for this year's positioning and target evaluation process and also for 1986 planning. Groups were conducted among female franchise and target 120's and Lights smokers, and male franchise 120's smokers. Focus group results will be forwarded week of 3/4 with Brand's perspective.  The Brand attended the Second Annual MORE Fashion Award auditions at Carnegie Hall in New York. The MORE Fashion Award was established to discover and recognize new fashion talent in America.  Judges Giorgio Sant'Angelo, Willi Smith and Michaele Vollbracht selected five finalists from a field of twenty- four semi-finalists. The five finalists will each present ten designs from their Fall 1985 collections to leading fashion retailers and journalists on 4/29 at the Pierre Hotel in New York. Judges from the final round of competition will include Mary McFadden and Carolina Herrera, in addition to the three designers named above. Hostess for the event will be French film star Catherine Deneuve. The 1985 winner will receive the MORE Fashion Award which was designed by Paloma Picasso.  Preliminary indications are that the press is providing good post-event coverage of the auditions. Articles have already © appeared in U.S.A. Today, the Daily News, and the New York Times, with additional coverage expected soon. The Brand will forward copies of all articles to me.  MAS:srh  ce  F. V. Creighton L. G. Disch  M. L. Gann  Cc.

RCV BYSRIRT EXT. RELATIONS > 7-18-91 +10:50AM : 20245793505 9197417975: # 2  FA  FILE COP        TALKING POINTS MIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin on ETS  Background  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has issued a Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) on ETS in the workplace which concludes ETs is "a potential occupational carcinogen" and which recommends “exposures be reduced to the lowest feasible concentration."  The CIB suggests that "exposure to ETS is most efficiently and completely controlled by simply eliminating tobacco use from the workplace." Short of a smoking ban, the CIB recommends separate ventilation for smoking areas.  Responses  ° No effort is made in the CIB to assess actual workplace exposures to ETS, Instead, tha report simply states that 29% of U.S. adults smoke, that urinary cotinine hag bean observad in nonsmokers and that respirable suspended particulate measures support the notion that nonsmokers are exposed in the  workplace.  -- of the eleven epidemiologic studies on ETS that examine workplace smoking exposure, only one reports a significant association <-= ten report no such statistically significant association.  “-- The authors of the one workplace study to report a statistically significant association suggested in their report that the association was weak and did not seem to fall in line with the other conclusions of the study.  - The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently argued, in response to an Action on Smoking and Health law suit seeking an emergency temporary standard banning workplace smoking, that the data on workplace exposure is scant, and is insufficient to support an emergency standard. OSHA's arguments were upheld by the vis: gourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  -~ Several scientific papers, including research undertaken by the American Health Foundation, have reported that workplace exposure to ETS is far lower than that found in the home, The CIB does not even mention this data, let alone discuss it, though the CIB concedes that "the relative contributions of work versus home environments in ETS exposure has not been well quantified."  oO  Ss  ~ ~l J oO oo ee re __label__Report

Subject: RE: 6' and 8' OPM Conversion  As areminder, my recommendation is not to ship OPMs fo retail accounts with a missing panel in the OPM. Our accounts and FSF will be confused and we would have just created total chaos at field level.  Additionally, by placing these items on hold we are confronted with potential rejected orders or confusion as we are just beginning the new allocation process.  The plan we should be looking at is establishing a clear Game Plan & communications to Madden and HUB agents collectively.  Harbor has about 100 message panels in spare paris and plans to ship them to Roselle on Monday (Bulk). Secondly, Bob met with Molly, an prepares a PO for 3,000 + (depending on open orders from Stacey and projected number at TPI ) Message panels for 6’ & 8' OPMs.  Hub recaps to Madden the total number of OPMs they have at each TPI depot that needs to be retrofitted.  A labor force is hired and is sent to Roselle to open aif 6' & 8' opms and remove the clocks and make one good OPM from 2 OPMs (marking each completed OPM with a retrofitted sticker). Additional panels would be shipped from Roselle to TP! depots to have agents retrofit them PRIOR to the day they are to be installed. {Documentation outline to follow)  Once the production of the Panels are completed from Harbor they are shipped to Roselle and the remaining OPMs are made whole using the hired labor force again.  | know this is not the complete process flow, but does present a solution with out upsetting our current process.

@ TO:  FROM:     PHILIP MORRI A INTER-OFFICE RRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592 Distribution DATE: July 13, 1994 Marian Halpern LS WVarnaw ENERATION X F ROUPS - 4.  SUBJECT:  DETAILED FINDINGS  BACKGROUND/METHODOLOGY  The primary objective of this research was to further learn about Generation Xers. To achieve this objective, two focus groups were held among 18-24 year old males and females in Englewood, NJ. on June 3,1994.  Respondents were asked to discuss a number of issues, including:  « What they think Generation X is all about  ¢ Factors that unite and/or influence their generation  ¢ Similarities and differences between their generation and their parent's generation  ¢ Segments into which their generation can be divided and how those segments can be identified :  Towards the end of the groups, respondents were shown a number of print ads and were asked to sort them into piles depicting different segments of the population. They were then questioned about why the ads were for these specific groups, with a special focus on ads that they felt were for them  SUMMARY OF HINDINGS  These young adults view their generation as diverse, having varied interests and lifestyles. Differences between people are expected and accepted. These differences enable Generation Xers to have friends who are interested a variety of things and lead lives that are not the same as their own.  Despite the diversity found among these young adults, Generation Xers do appear to share certain attitudinal and behavioral characteristics. Specifically, these shared characteristics are that they:  - Resist segmentation and labeling  - Are self-focused  - Have mistrust for the news media  - Show marketing savvy  - Like to try new things and experience life  - Believe financial security is important but is not their ultimate goal  Respondents in both groups had heard of the term "Generation X", with some indicating that the term had negative connotations. Specifically, one young woman stated that Generation Xers "...supposedly don't care about anything."  9925698902 __label__Memo

Wu, Ph.D. Dept of Biochemsitry  University of North Texas Denton, TX 76203  Dear Dr. Wu:  Thank you for your expression of interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose a recent Annual Report that lists grants currently supported and a brochure describing policies of The Council. Our application procedure is a two-step process, comprising a preliminary inquiry and, if that is approved, a final proposal. To accomplish the first step, potential applicants should submit a brief (3 to 4 page) preliminary outline of the study for which support is sought. It should contain the following information:  1. A synopsis of the project under investigation, its present goals and status.  2. A brief outline of plans and goals for the proposed research, specifying the next steps to be taken. .  3. Anticipated duration and annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that The Council will only provide support for a maximum of 3 years. Although grants are made for one year at a time, up to two annual renewals can be considered on the basis of progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications. :  It would also be helpful to have:  1. Brief curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal professional level collaborators. The two-page NIH format is preferred for the preliminary inquiry.  2. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely related to the project for which funding is being sought.  Preliminary inquires are evaluated by the Executive Committee of our Scientific Advisory Board for scientific merit and for "fit" into The Council’s current multidisciplinary biomedical research program. The reviewers either encourage or discourage submission of a formal detailed application for full competitive consideration. That process takes approximately two months. If the vote is to encourage, then appropriate forms and instructions are provided. Submission deadlines for full (not preliminary) applications are May 31 and November 30;  activation is typically seven months later.

HK 2205125  ARNON PERRY*  )  This article focuses on two questions: To whot extent can the attitude toward and the consumption of aleehol, cigarettes, ond coffee be explained by o genetic factor? and To what extent can heredity be the link between two personality traits, anxiety ond extroversion-introversion, ond the attitude foward the consumption of  these three products?  Heredity, Personality Traits, Product Attitude, and Product Consumption—An Exploratory Study  ‘INTRODUCTION  This article focuses on the relationships between per- sonality traits, product attitude. and product consump- tion. It has been assumed in most previous studies in this area (1, 2, 6, 7, 16. 17, 19, 25, 26, 27, 29) that some form of reciprocal relationship exists betmeen product attitude or consumption and specific personality traits. There is evidence [4, 8. 11. £2, 14] which suggests that personality in itself-is affected by heredity. In this article we shall examine the extent to which heredity can explain the variance in specific personality traits, prod- uct attitude, and product consumption, individually as well as their interrelationships. :  The selection of products and personality traits for this study was based on results from previous studies. For personality traits, extraversion-introversion (ET) and anxiety (A) were sclected using scales devised by Ey. senck [10] and Bendig [3} respectively. Eysenck und Prell {13}, EysencK 19}, and Shiclds [20] found these traits to have a significant genetic componcnt. For prod- uct attitude und consumption, cigurcttes, coffee, und al- coho! were selected for two reasons. First. consumers of the products tend to develop hubitual patterns of con- sumption, making it difficult for them ty stop. Second, Partanen, Bruun, and Markkanen (18] in a study of the inheritance of alcoholic drinking, coffee_drinking, and cigurette_ smoking behavior found that, of the alcoholic drinking variables, densiry (a combined factor of fre-              ® Arnon Perry is a lecturer at The Leon Recanati Graduate School of Business Administration, Tel-Aviv University.

Both coffee drinking and cigarette smoking  showed _a significant heritability on the @meunt con- sumed. Although the relationship, if any, between ha-  bitual consumption and heredity has not been estab-. lished, it is not unreasonable to hypothesize a relationship between the two. : Some evidence was introduced by Smart [21], who found acurvilinear relationship between anxiety and the frequency of drinking among college students, using Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Eysenck [12] found “extraversion to be related to cigarette smoking, and Smith (22, 23]. in two separate studies using college stu- dents and preudult subjects and a different scale from the one developed by Eysenck, has found that smokers scored significantly higher on measures of extraversion.  METHOD  The research design employed here calls for a sample of MZ! and DZ twins. The underlying principle of the twin method is that MZ twins have identical genotypes, and therefore any observed dissimilarity within pairs must be related to environmental factors. DZ, same sex twins, while on the average differing in SO of their genes, provide a measure of environmental control not otherwise possible by sharing such factors as birth rank and mother’s age. Once the within-pairs variances (Viz and V)) have been calculated, the twin method allows  * Throughout the article the conventional abbreviations MZ (for nvonozygots-identical) and DZ (for dizygous-fraternal) twins are used. Identical twins (MZ) were produced from the same ovunr and therefore are identical in all their genes. Fraternal twins (D2) wete produced from separate ova and are actually brothers of sisters that happened to be born at the same time.  76  J  Journal of Marketing Research, Vol. X (November 1973), 376-9 __label__Scientific
1980 Accountability of: Jack Bellis Manager: D.W. Tredennick  Object: To improve the Copy Research Process in order to provide better guidance for copy decisions. Two separate aspects of this objective are:  1) The establishment of a Standard Communication Test  to serve as the primary research tool in ad/copy development.  2) To review all existing literature on print communication principles and ad research prin- ciples in order to heighten user understanding of why ad research is conducted as it is.  Establishment of Standard Communications Test  Accomplishments:  1) Design of test technique/methodology, including basic questionnaire, through consultation with J. Coulson.  2) Experiment with test to identify strengths and weaknesses and investigate any possible ad format bias (i.e., rough vs. finished ads, product vs. imagery predominant ads).  3) Documentation of test to establish sensitivity, reliability, and validity.  Results: A revised Policy and Procedure Manual for Copy Research which will define the role of the communications test and the role of the placement recall test in the copy research process (i.e., developmental vs. evaluative research). The revised manual will also provide detailed explanation of and docu- mentation for the two standard tests.

PHILIP MORRIS COMPANIES INC. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017     TO: Distribution pate: August 25, 1989  FROM: Murray H. Bring We?  SUBJECT: Scientific Article     Attached hereto is an important and interesting recently published article by Dr. Carl C. Seltzer at Harvard. It contains a critical analysis of the Framingham Heart Study, which has been the principal epidemiological study relied upon by the Surgeon General to reach his conclusion that there is a strong, association between smoking and coronary heart disease (CHD).  In this article, Dr. Seltzer disputes the Surgeon General's conclusion and points to a number of unexplained anomalies in the data. The most significant points are:  1. The statistical association between smoking and heart disease is below the level established by Hutchison and Wynder for the conclusion of a strong association. In fact, under the Hutchison-Wynder criterion, the association would be designated as "weak."  2. The Framingham data do not demonstrate any increase in the incidence of CHD based upon the duration of smoking in either men or women.  3. Most significant is the finding that smokers who quit smoking have a lower incidence of CHD than people who have never smoked at all.  Dr. Seltzer concludes that the important Framingham study simply does not support the "conventional wisdom" which the Surgeon General has propagated.  Attachment  Distribution Hamish Maxwell Jiohn A.

Berson  RE: TRUE FOCUS GROUPS - FINAL REPORT ~ MRD #5542/884  ---e tonnage ee nn  BACKGROUND, AND PURPOSE  A new True ldW tar line extension is scheduled for Test Market  during May, 1985. Part of the research Program for this new  product consisted of a qualitative exploration of several .  proposed advertising concepts.  The primary purpose of the qualitative sessions was to obtain  input. on the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and  Getermine which if any, offered potential. It was also important  to understand consumers’ reactions to a new True product in light : os of current attitudes toward the brand. | O     METHOD  _ A total of eight’ focus group sessions were conducted in two markets -~- Manhassett, Long Island and Atlanta, Georgia. All groups were composed of competitive smokers (10+ cigarettes per day) between the ages 25 and 44. The structure of the greups was consistent across both markets -~- half male, half female; haif lo-tar, half lo-fi (low tar prone). "Low tar prone" was defined  as having "top 3 box" purchase intent to try a low tar brand in the future.  CONCLUSIONS  Overall, the True Gold concept met with favorable reaction. The interest for this idea was fairly equal across the major lo-fi and low tar segments although females were certainly more positive about it than males. (While more males were positive than negative, favorability among this group occurred at a lower frequency when compared to females). Males tended to see the concept as more femiriine whereas females were more likely’to view  it'as neutrals | .  & ‘Because of the many differences in creative presentation, - ” packaging, tar level and filter, True Gold was seen as having little in common with the currently marketed True product. In  fact, many group members did not see the two as related until  GLETESE8 __label__Memo

From the Department of Medicine, University of Southern California M edical School, and the Nash Cardiovascular Foundation, Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Los Angeles, California,  Stimulation of the peripheral circulation is of decided benefit in the treatment ‘of a number of clinical conditions, especially Ray- naud’s disease, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and vasospasm accompanying arteriosclerosis obliterans as well as thromboangiitis obliter- ans. Such an increase in the blood flow to the extremities can be accomplished through medication with vasodilating drugs, however always at the risk of certain undesirable side reactions, as for instance, sleepiness, or dizzi- ness. Tt was therefore decided to determine whether or not the new quaternary amine 2,6 dimethyl diethyl piperidinium bromide (SC 1950),* synthesized by I. C. Winter and his associates, increases the blood flow to the extremities and thus exerts a significant in- fluence upon peripheral circulation. ‘his drug, described as a ganglionic blocking agent, has proved in animal experiments to be several limes as potent as tetraethylammon- ium bromide(1) and results in man and dog in lowering of blood pressure, reduction of tonus, and concomitant increase in the skin temperature of the toe(2).  Methods and materials. he effectiveness of SC 1950 was siudied in 5 normal indi- viduals and 21 patients with peripheral ar- terial disease.

Of the 21 patients with arterial discase, 14 were males, 7 females, the average age in this group amounting to 33 years (24 to 55). In 10 cases the diagnosis was arteriosclerosis obliterans, in 5 essential benign hypertension, in 4 thromboangiitis obliterans, while hyper- tension secondary to pyelonephritis, and to periarteritis nodosa was noted in one case each, The experiments were conducted under standard reproducible conditions. All subjects were dressed in hospital gowns and examined after 45 minutes of rest. Observations were made in an air conditioned room with a temperature of 25°C + 1.5°, the air velocity amounting ordinarily to less than 10 feet per minute.  Changes in the volume of the extremities were determined by means of a digital pneu- moplethysmograph(3) and a digital cup was fastened to the tip of the right or left second toe or finger. Plethysmograms were standard- ized so that volume changes were recorded in cu mm/5 cc per sec. Blood flow to the extremities was ascertained through venous ocelusion(4) and a collecting cuff placed at ankle or wrist and in selected cases at finger or toe. In order to establish the skin tem- perature, thermocouple junctions were fixed to the skin of the extremitics with cellulose tape, and readings from a 12-point electronic potentiometer were recorded every [5 seconds. These observations were exact within = 0.25°C, and the accuracy of the instrument employed was frequently tested with a Na- tional Burcau of Standards mercury ther- mometer, exact to within 0.1°C.

1991 PLAN NORTH DAKOTA  ROBERT E. FACKLER  SITUATION ANALYSIS  North Dakota has an 80 day state legislative session in 1991. Prefiling of bills took place December 4-6, 1990. A bill banning vending machines was prefiled.  The state excise tax on cigarettes was increased from .18 a pack to .27 in July of 1987. Taxes started the year at .30 per pack. A sunset provision taking place on 7/91 will lower the tax by .03 to .27 per pack.  1)  3)  4)  Cigarette Excise Tax Increase: It is likely that a bill to repea] the "Sunset Clause" that lowers the tax on cigarettes .03 per pack and is scheduled to take effect July 1, 1991 will be introduced. It would keep the tax on a pack of cigarettes at .30 per pack. There is also a strong anti-tax sentiment in ND. But a repeal of the Sunset Clause is an easier vote for the legislature than a new tax increase. For this reason, I feel it could pass. The SRGs wil] be working to fight the  repeal.  Other Tobacco Taxes: A bill increasing taxes on other tobacco products will likely be introduced. With the strong anti-tax sentiment in ND a vote for an increase in new taxes would be a much tougher vote than a repeal of the Sunset Clause. There is 50\50 chance of this one passing. Any Tax increase is unacceptable to the SRGs and they will be opposing it.  Smoking Restrictions: A Clean Indoor Air bill will likely be introduced. Some parts of it could very well pass. The SRGs have fought smoking restrictions in the past and will continue  to make this issue a priority.  Sampling Ban: There is a 50/50 chance that a bill will be  introduced. It is however, unlikely to pass. North Dakotan's are notorious for not wanting Government to interfere with the  business community.  on gS or  wal  ao G@  S __label__Report
a EEE —_— ee     __  DRAF'?-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT~-DRAFT-DRAFT-DRAFT—-DRAFT—DRAFT—-DRAFT—-DRAFT  HIGHLIGHTS DATE: April 24, 1990 BIOBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH =  Psychophysiology of Smoking - Integration of analytical chemistry data with EEG, heart rate, task-performance, and mood/feeling rating data from the 1989 EEG study was begun. Subjects were segregated into 3 groups based on  pre- to post-smoking plasma nicotine ‘rise’. Appropriate analyses of Variance are underway.  Drs. Reynolds, Robinson, and Pritchard met discuss a study to determine the optimal structure for DFC (Desire For Cigarette) measurement. Ina subsequent meeting, Drs. Robinson and Pritchard planned the detailed experimental design.  Basic Sensory Research - Evoked brain potentials, respiration, and sensory data were collected from one subject during exposure to nicotine. This session completed collection of required evoked potential data for 6 subjects. Collection of data from subject 5, an in-house volunteer, is all that remains for the completion of this phase of the work.  Mr. Roger Jennings prepared computer files of sensory attribute data on ETS chemicals from recently published reports. Sensory information on chemicals in ETS will be incorporated into a relational database that contains other information on the compounds. The data base will be used to answer end-user questions on specific chemicals or sensory characteristics.  UNIFY database software, currently on the Biobehavioral Division’s SUN computer, was evaluated by Mr. Jennings for use with the ETS data.  Dr. Jim Walker attended the 12th annual meeting of the Association of Chemoreception Sciences. He presented a paper entitled "Effects of Odorants on Respiratory Behavior and Nasal Patency." It was timely, owing to a  great deal of interest by meeting participants in the question of perceived irritation in humans. The following were noted at the meeting: an increase  in research on primate gustatory and olfactory systems, renewed interest in "taste" sensations mediated by the olfactory system, increased representation of manufacturers of fragrances and others who use fragrances to enhance product appeal, increased competition among NIH-funded chemosensory centers, increased interest in the "olfactory deficit" in Alzheimer’ Ss disease, sophisticated use of voltage-sensitive dyes and video- imaging techniques, interest in the measurement of human respiratory behavior, an increase in the number of industrial chemosensory scientists conducting psychophysical studies, an increase in the number of chemosensory scientists in consumer product R&D, and increased interest in odorant-evoked potentials.  Smoke Component Dose - Mr. Davis sought information from Dr. Brian Lawrence and Mr. Brian Smeeton (P&AT) about tea cultivation and the use of nicotine sulfate as a pesticide. Mr. Davis is preparing to survey a number of teas for potential nicotine content. We and others have observed nicotine in teas previously.  Nicotine Receptor Pharmacology - Dr. Eric Fluhler continued to characterize     the effects of nicotine on calcium flux in synaptosomes prepared from adult ~~  rat brain. Results indicate that micromolar concentrations of nicotine Significantly increase intrasynaptosomal concentrations of calcium. Modulation of calcium levels is thought to help regulate the release of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals in vivo. The abilities of several  f8OG 66L4G __label__Report

Role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in endothelial  cell retraction  REBECCA SHELDON, ALAN MOY, KATHY LINDSLEY, SANDRA SHASBY, AND D. MICHAEL SHASBY Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine and the Veterans Administration Hospital, Iowa City, lowa 52242  Sheldon, Rebecca, Alan Moy, Kathy Lindsley, Sandra Shasby, and D. Michael Shasby. Role of myosin light-chain phosphorylation in endothelial cell retraction. Am. J, Physiol. 265 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 9): L606-L612, 1993.— Endothelial cells retract centripetally when they are exposed to histamine and when extracellular calcium is chelated. This cen- tripetal retraction implies that a centripetal tension must be expressed in the cells. We asked whether phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin (MLC) was important for the retraction to occur, and, by inference, expression of the tension. In human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells and in porcine pulmo- nary artery endothelial (PPAE) cells tryptic peptide maps in- dicated that MLC was phosphorylated by myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). Activity of MLCK is inhibited by ML-9, a kinase inhibitor with relative specificity for MLCK, and when MLCK is phosphorylated by the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic mono- phosphate (cAMP)-dependent kinase. Pretreatment of HUVE cells or PPAE cells with ML-9 or forskolin-aminophylline (to increase cell cAMP) reduced basal MLC phosphorylation and prevented an expected increase in MLC phosphorylation fol- lowing exposure of HUVE cells to histamine. Pretreatment of HUVE cells with MU-9 or forskolin-aminophylline prevented HUVE cell retraction (measured as an increase in permeability of a monolayer of HUVE cells) in response to histamine. Pre- treatment of PPAE cells with ML-9 or forskolin-aminophylline prevented PPAE cell retraction in response to chelation of ex- tracellular calcium. These data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of MLC is an important component of endo- thelial cell retraction.  tension; substrate adherence; calcium  INFLAMMATORY EDEMA is associated with separation of adjacent endothelial cells (2, 4, 15, 17, 19, 24, 25, 28). Although there are multiple reports documenting this, the mechanism of cell separation is not well explained.  Agents that chelate calcium and interrupt calcium- dependent cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion cause edema and separation of adjacent endothelial cells (19, 25). These observations suggest that separation may re- sult from loss of tethering between cells and between cells and substrate. They also imply that a constitutive centripetal tension opposes the tethering, and unop- posed expression of this constitutive tension contributes to cell retraction when the tethering is released.  Other investigators have suggested that the separa- tion of adjacent endothelial cells involves initiation or augmentatios of a centripetal tension that is mediated by actin and myosin (22, 29). This position is based on the observation that 100 uM calcium, ATP, myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and calmodulin caused phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin (MLC) and contraction of the actin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells  after their cell membranes were removed with detergents (22, 29, 30).  L606  We previously observed that histamine caused retrac-  - tion of human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells,  that this was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with agents that increased cell adenosine 3',5'-cyclic mono- phosphate (cAMP), and that the increased cAMP did not prevent histamine from increasing calcium in the HUVE cells (4). More recently we found that MLCK constitutively phosphorylates MLC in HUVE cells (0.21 + 0.02 mol phosphate/mol MLC), that histamine in- creases MLC phosphorylation (0.19 + 0.05 mol phosphate/mol MLC), and that cAMP reduces the con- stitutive level of phosphorylation (to 0.06 + 0.02 mol phosphate/mol MLC) and prevents the increase in phosphorylation expected after histamine exposure (18). Although these experiments were consistent with the idea that cAMP prevented the response to histamine by preventing MLC‘ phosphorylation, activation of the cAMP-dependent kinase could also have other effects on the cytoskeleton of the cells that might contribute to inhibition of retraction. In the experiments described in this paper we extend these observations by deter- mining the effects of inhibition of MLC phosphoryla- tion by two very different mechanisms on the retrac- tion of endothelial cells in response to an increase in centripetal tension (histamine) and to a loss of tether- ing (calcium chelation).

The principle of the program is: “The best way to keep kids away from cigarettes is to keep cigarettes away from kids.” The PM USA Sales Force will be playing a pivotal role in ensuring the success of this comprehensive program.  Here are some of our immediate responsibilities.  . Effective immediately, we will discontinue free cigarette sampling to consumers.  ° Effective immediately, we will not distribute cigarettes through the mail.  * We will deny merchandising benefits to stores which are fined for or convicted of selling cigarettes to minors.  ° Before announcing Action Against Access, we were involved in placing minimum age signs and related materials provided by PM USA's "Ask First/It's the Law" educational program in more than 200,000 retail outlets across the country. Rapid placement of that material has become a basic element of Action Against Access, and placement is thus elevated to a priority assignment for the PM USA Sales Force. :  ° Bach member of the Sales Force must remain vigilant as we intensify our aggressive efforts to prevent the use of Philip Morris cigarette brand names or logos on any item marketed to minors, including video games and toys.  denial of merchandising benefits to retailers who are fined  eo so oe oe fae One of the strictest sanctions of Action Against Access is J or for or convicted of selling cigarettes to minors.

He would like to  interview you sometime between September 9-15 or after September 20.  Background:  Capital is the leading French economic/business magazine. It is published by the Prisma Group and has ties with the German group, Gruener & Jahr, which publishes the German edition of  Capital.  The French Capital was introduced in October 1991 and met with immediate success. It surpassed the then-leading French economic  monthly, L'Expansion. Today, Capital's circulation has reached almost 300,000.  Capital employs somewhat unusual angles: it tries to ‘humanize’ its stories, making the economy and business readable and appealing to everybody.  Capital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page story to a large company which is in the news because of its success (or failure.) Mr. Wattez  is preparing such a story on PM -- as an example of success. He has already interviewed Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael  Horst (EC) and Ray Viault (Jacobs Suchard). He has also seen PM sponsorship in action by attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand  Prix.  ¥999999%  , +  ry ¢ __label__Memo

"~ i] = Q. oO > ¢ = a emf °o o  THE ARGUS 5 4-23-9b RAMENTO — Assemblyman’ John’ Burton California could collect more than $1 billion OF its budget by filing suit against the tobacco in- ‘dustry to recoup public funds spent treating smoking- preiated ilnesses. == The San Francisco Democrat has been pushing a Frésolution to that effect, but with little success. First, the Republican-controlled Assembly shunted his mea- sur ‘Off to the Rules Committee. And Monday, Repub- icans on the Rules Committee killed it. -Burton said he didn’t know why Republicans — Olt eof whom are pushing measures to ease smoking strictions — ‘would dislike his measure, which calls it Aftoitiey General Dan Lungren to sue all tobacco roripaniés for the cost of treating Medi-Cal patients or nesses caused by smoking.                                        “Here’s an opportunity to get a lot of money for  acco suits idea _  2070397531  ath  the state budget,” he said. “Tes not a stupid, off-the-- wall idea.”  At least five states have already filed such lawsuits, and several more are expected to do so shortly. The Liggett Group, the smallest of the top five cigarette makers, stunned the industry last month when it said  “jt would settle claims filed by Florida, Massachusetts,’  Mississippi, Louisiana and West Virginia. *  Despite the potential gain to the state, Assembly Republicans felt that the decision on whether to sué was best left to the attorney general, said Wendy. Weber, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove.  Lungren spokesman Steve Telliano said the at- torney general hadn't decided whether or not to file a lawsuit, and hadn’t taken a position on Burton’s pro- posal. “We're monitoring what's being filed in the suits in other states,’ he said. : __label__News
March 26, 1984  To: OD. F. Pearson  RE: Moviegoer Meeting March 16     This will report on our meeting with Christ Whittle at which 13-30 presented an update and stewartship report. in response to my letter  of February 28.  Overall, 13-30 appears to be delivering the staffing and services required by the contract or spelled out in the original 1981 proposal. In those cases where there are exceptions, they seem to have a  reasonable explanation.  The following is a brief summary on each area covered:  Field Staffing  Internal and field staffing equals or exceeds that outlined in the original proposal. While some of the internal and field staffing also spend time on other 13-30 properties, it seems that overall the original requirements are being met. One significant change involves the substitution of full-time service reps in place of part-time  service people.           Monitoring  Monitoring and restocking of books is maintained on a twice weekly basis vs. the original plan to service weekly. Area managers now meet with chain theatre personnel every 6 months to maintain        " relationship, deal with problems, etc. A toll free phone service is now available to theatre managers to identify problems and request service.  Circulation by Market  f A summary of circulation by market is attached. We also have theatre detail by market available. This circulation has not changed significantly over the past 2 years.     Market Analysis of Annual Reader Poll  Reader response polls, conducted via insert cards, were part of the original plan. These have been executed to determine movie preference, frequency of moviegoing, etc. We may also use this service to determine demographics, brand preferences, etc. We can also use full run card  inserts on a cost basis for promotion purposes.        t96h €OnOS __label__Letter

Lerlllard  MEMORANDUM  August 21, 1995  TOs K. Paitakis FROM: A. Sadovnick  SUBJECT: PHONE CARD SUPPLIER  As discussed, Schneider Communications, our phone card supplier, was acquired by Frontier Communications on August 8, 1995. Frontier then merged with ALC on August 16, 1995. The new  company has a market value of $4.3 biltion, according to the attached newsletter.  The implication of this merger relative to our promotions on Kent, True, and Style is simply, that we are now dealing with a much larger supplier. Geri Matzke has assured me there will be no changes in pricing or any delay in implementing the program due to this merger.  Frontier Communications is an original provider of telephone time, as well as the fifth largest long distance carrier in the U.S. (see attached letter).

RUA SOON ayy  Subject:  To:        AL © C  e Memorandum  Alternate Approaches to Low-Sidestream Cigarettes Date: December 21, 1982  Dr. A. Rodgman From: D. E. Townsend Dr. D. H. Piehl Mr. J. D.Phillips  Several staff members in R&D have obtained information which is epplicable to the development of low-sidestream cigarettes. I have prepared two low-sidestream prototypes, one with information obtained by Dr. J. L. Harris and the other with Harrie’ information combined with the use of “carbonized” filler provided by Mr. J. White. Informal emoking suggeste that these prototypes do not exhibit the harsh, irritating mainstream taste and irritating sidestream sroma which ie common to the current CC~prototypes.  Dr. Harris has demonstrated (R&DM, 1982, No. 50; CIM, 1980, No. 27; CIM, 1977, No. 4) that the use of cigarette paper made without CaCO, filler results in very low smolder rates and hence low sidestream deliveries.” The major disadvantage is that due to the reduced smolder rate, the puff count is extraordinarily high (“20-25 puff/cig). He suggested that unusual configurations are required to obtain cigarettes with reasonable deliveries and puff counts.  Prototype DET-111682-B was prepared with CaCO,-free cigarette paper (supplied by Schweitzer) and 27.5mm long non air-diluted filters made with 2.9/44,000 tow. NOW 100 blend (high G-13 level) was used in an effort to reduce the puff count to acceptable levels. The resulte of smoke analyses are presented in Table 1. It is clear that as compared to WINSTON KS (SS 'tar' “25mg/cig), substantial reductions (750%) in measured sidestream ‘tar’ were achieved while satisfactory mainstream delivery and acceptable puff count were obtained.  Prototype DET~111682-A was similar to that described above except that the filler included 302 “carbonized” flue-cured stems (obtained from Mr. J. White). Mr. White has demonstrated that the use of “carbonized” filler in @ blend results in reduced sidestream deliveries. The results of smoke analyses for this prototype are also presented in Table 1. A comparison of samples A and B shows that the use of “carbonized” filler resulted in further sideatream 'tar' reduction. The sidestream 'tar' analysis for prototype A must be regarded as only an upper limit, however. Dr. Harris has demonstrated that the routine method for measurement of sidestream ‘tar’ is in error for cigarettes which contain “carbonized” filler. The actual 'tar' delivery is somewhat less than that measured due to a higher extinction coefficient for SS ‘tar’ from  cigarettes with “carbonized” filler. Thus, all we can say at this point is that the sidestream ‘tar’ reduction is in excess of ~ 60%,  The results of visible sidestream measurements are unavailable at this  time due to the load and priority of CC-prototypes. However, it is clear that the visible sidestream is very low.  LOST 6S2TS  RJR} FORM 2422—Rev. 7/70 __label__Letter

Guidelines 11/26/96 To: Berlind, Mark; Winokur, Matt  Mayada is correct in her statement regarding conflict of these draft ventilation guidelines with respect to "adapted" individuals. The ASHRAE comments state "There is no justification or clarification of why adapted occupants became the basis for determining ventilation rats. The strongest scientific basis for determination of ventilation rates is based on unadapted persons. There is no standard method to determine how an adapted occupant of a space can be satisfied or dissatisfied with the indoor air quality, particularly in relationship to other confounding indoor environmental factors..... "  We need to resolve this difference. Otherwise I think the guidelines look great, They sure are expanded in content since our meeting together. __label__Email

Would you also please pass on my appreciation to Koko for her help.  We are currently putting together the samples you requested of the different pack sizes, and should be able to get them to you in a few days.  I understand that the visit here by Chip Brumberg went well. He has confirmed that the CV reduction is due to leaf crop changes, and some minor modifications tp processing specifications have been agreed. This should settle things  down with respect to DIET processing for JT, although you should not expect DIET CV's to return to earlier levels as long as this blend / crop is in use.  I look forward to having you visit us over here at some time in the future.

I'd appreciate it if you would both keep this in mind as we go forward in 1996, and if significant projects arise that would throw us over budget, we will need to request more funds. Similarly, if we see that the projects are running under budget, we will have to reassess our needs and should reallocate any unused funds to other line items or projects.  apGlZ7£EL0Z2 __label__Email

~‘  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  TO:  FROM:  SUBJECT:  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, N.Y 10017  Herb Foster DATE: December 20, 1984  Richard M. Harvell  B&H Heavy Spending  This is the final report evaluating the B&H Heavy-up test which began in August 1984 in Shreveport, Seattle, Lubbock and Fresno. October will be the last month of data reported due to the Merit Box  introduction in November which took most of the available media that month.  Spending Levels  While spending for the total brand has doubled, the increase is applied to Lights in Lubbock and Fresno, and DUL in Seattle and Shreveport. As such, spending on those packings has essentially tripled, while spending on the remaining packings has changed very little. Below is a summary of the spending in each market.  B&H Dollar Expenditure (000)  Fresno Lubbock Seattle Shreveport     1983 local expenditures $ 137 $ 112 $ 579 $ 134 Previous 1984 projected 145 111 624 128 Current 1984 projected 275 215 1,213 243 Current indexed to previous 190 194 194 130  Market Share  After three months of data, this test cannot be adequately evaluated. However, at this point in time, the extra spending has had no effect on B&H. Share changes in the test markets as well as the total U.S. are insignificant (confidence interval is 95%).

June 20, 1988  TO: K. L. Verner  FROM: Y. M. Jones  RE: Factors Affecting SALEM’s Performance  Listed below are key long-term and short-term factors that have impeded SALEM’s ability to achieve Nielsen share objectives and volume for 1988 and, moreover, will also affect any projections pertaining to 1989.  I. Long Term 1) Continued growth of Savings Seqment  - SALEM particularly vulnerable due to franchise profile  - Represents a source of high switching losses for  SALEM 2) Continued decline of 18 - 34 year 01d target smokers among both General Market and Black Market smokers  ~ Losses of "quits" are not being offset by gains from "new" which places longer-term downward pressure on SALEM’s share trend  II. Short Te 1) Increased competitive price/promotion pressure  - Higher Savings Segment pressure including probable expansion of Alpine in 1988 and 1989  - Proliferation of menthol line extensions - New strategy by B&W to place market support  behind volume for Kool, typically. a major contributor to SALEM switching gains  2zEs SSS0S __label__Letter

DBL APR251988_RESD  —  April i8 ~ April 22, 1988  To: Mr. B. M. Wagner  ware  SUBJECT: Project URP Weekly Status  Central Laboratory Services representatives attended VRP status meetings 4/19 & 4/20. The meetings are summarized as follows:  .  ars .  . Cigarette Paper R&D will address the need for a specification on Sodiun Acetate in VRP paper. Sodium Acetate is found in VRP Paper as a result of the bleaching process.  The presence of Sodium Acetate causes a discrepancy between the method Ecusta uses for Potassium Acetate and the method RJR GA and RJR R&D use. Ecusta's method for detection of Potassium Acetate reports both Potassium and Sodium Acetate  - as Potassium Acetate. GA is able to to test for and report Potassium Acetate, Sodium Acetate or Total Acetate. The specifications as currently written addresses only Potassium Acetate levels.  The April 12th shipment of VRP paper contained nq Potassium Acetate but had signifigant amounts of Sodium Acetate.  Visible Sidestream Apparatus/Measurenment The Visible Sidestream Apparatus is to be delivered to QA 4/21. Operator training and correlation testing will begin as soon as the apparatus is operational. .  R&D is to provide written test methods to QA prior to analysis of test market product.  The test market product will be jointly tested by R&D and GA. Both the 85 and 100 mm brand styles will be split, with each lab testing half of the samples.  Brand R&D has requested QA assistance in measuring visible sidestream smoke on prototypes. QA will provide assistance to R&D as provided on other analytical methods, i.e. QA will  assist R&D with overflow prototype testing, provided the additional analyses will not put OA in an overtime  situation.

Friday, May 24, 1991  AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL  * The federal government’s increasing use of risk assessment in making decisions on how to control pollution was the focus of Congressman Scheuer’s Subcommittee on the Environment hearings May 21 on "Risk Assessment: Strengths and Limitations of Utilization for Policy Decision." Lester B. Lave, an economics professor from Carnegie- Mellon University, said that risk assessment methods adopted by the EPA often had little scientific support. Witnesses called for the creation of a new scientific agency to  review risk analysis methods.  IN THE STATES  * The Minnesota legislature passed two cigarette bills before closing its 1991 session. The budget bill includes a 5-cent cigarette tax effective July 1; another bill would create a subsidized health insurance program with a 4-cent cigarette increase on June 1 and a 3-cent increase in 1993. Both measures await action by Governor Carlson.  * In Vermont, lawmakers have agreed to raise the cigarette tax by 3 cents in penny increments through 1992. The budget package, sent to Governor Snelling, also raises the sales tax to 5 percent and repeals exemption for other tobacco products.  * The Missouri legislature passed a $375 million education bill with a 5-cent raise in the cigarette tax and a new 10 percent tax levy on other tobacco products. The measure, which also raises the sales tax and adjusts personal income taxes, must go before the voters on a November 5 ballot. Lawmakers also sent to Governor Ashcroft a privacy bill that would ban discrimination based on off-the-job use of lawful products.  * The Massachusetts House adopted a budget bill after rejecting a proposed 5-cent cigarette tax increase. As sent to the Senate, the bill does not address tobacco taxes.  * In Alaska, the legislature adjourned without acting on a proposed 12-cent increase on cigarette taxes and a tax increase on smokeless tobacco products. Also dying with adjournment were a vending ban and sampling restriction bills. Lawmakers did send to Governor Hickel a bill to put a smoking "warning" on signs currently required where  alcoholic beverages are sold, warning about consumption during pregnancy. continued...

Subject; OLD GOLD . To: Mr.Lennen Br .MitchelL Mr.Lynn Mr,Pietsch  The criminal analysis turned out quite unfavorably for Old Gold. But it led to a discovery which explains the resulta, and vy which,  to all indications, Old Gold can easily produce the best "bill of health” of all four brands.  This observation is almost absurdly simple, yet it has never been noted as far as Professor MacTavish can learn, in any of the scientific literature on the cigarette. Tt is the fact that the angunt of motsture present in the tobacco —- br to put it another way - the "freshness" of the cigarette — controls the quantity of irritating substances formed during combustion. The dryer the cigarette, the more irritating. And a difference in the amount of moisture, which would be imperceptible to the amoker, cen violently effect the results of an analysis.  MacTavish deduced this fact from a atudy of the results of his first test. But to prove it he made a simple test of the smoke from the four cigarettes under controlled moisture conditions and by adding only 2% to Old Gold's moisture was able to make it show up much better than any cigarette in the original test.  Te reason for thia powerful influence of moisture on the amount ef irritants formed is apparentiy that the butt end of the ciga= rette (when the tobacco is relatively moist or "rreah") acts aa  .a condenser and withholds some of the natural irritants from passing into the throat.  But before discussing the possibilities of using this observation to Old Gold's advantage, it would be best to review the original analyais of the four cigarettes. The four brands were bought at . the same time at the United Cigar Store in the Grand Central Sta+ ° tion, and the dealer told Professor MacTavish that they had ail  been received that morning fron the wholesalcr. Premunaply they were equally fresh. But you will observe in the results a con= siderable difference in moisture contont.  These arg the highlights of the original smoke analyals: Oo J : - 7 , ‘ ot 3 > . - . ' mr . , " . - oO  ‘ : a  ee ee eo we ee eo © ON& __label__Memo
HOWARD HEWETT  With his current release of I Commit To Love, Howard Hewett, the former lead singer of Shalamar, has fulfilled a lifetime desire. He candidly commented, "Doing a solo (album) has been a goal of mine for a long, long time. Shalamar's last tour (with me) received reviews calling it the ‘Howard Hewett Show' and now, it is."  Hewett joined Shalamar in 1979 and led the group through a string of hit albums including: Big Fun, Three For Love, Go For It and Friends. His last project with Shalamar was Heartbreak, which included the hit single “Dancin' In The Sheets" from the box office smash movie, Footloose.  A native of Akron, Ohio, Hewett began his career as part of the Hewett Singers, a gospel group that performed with the likes of the Staple Singers and the Mighty Clouds of Joy. However, his wish to expand his musical career soon led Howard to various R&B bands in his hometown and, finally, to Shalamar.  Now, aS a songwriter and singer, Hewett is embarking on a new journey in his already illustrious musical career.  # # #  699105342  3380 ERIE AVENUE, CINCINNATI, OHIO 45208, (513) 321-6688  699135342  PRODUC]              ED FROM B&W WEB SITE __label__Report

1- The National Restaurant Association has testified against the OSHA smoking ban. The N. R. A. study shows a projected annual loss of $18.2 billion in restaurant revenues if smoking is banned nationwide. This dramatic loss in sales would mean decreased jobs and government revenue as well. In light of all that, what is wrong with restaurants simply establishing their own ‘policies, either allowing smoking or not, but making their own decision on the issue?  2- Gaming facilities on Indian reservations are a growing source of competition for America's gaming industry. National and state legislative and regulatory restrictions do not, however, apply to Indian reservations. So efforts such as the statewide ban you supported in California will put the gaming industry at a distinct competitive disadvantage. How can you in good conscience support government policies which will ban smoking at commercial facilities while it is still allowed on Indian lands?  3- There has been a lot of talk that a national smoking ban would create a “level playing field" in which no restaurant enjoys an advantage over any other, since none could allow smoking. Yet that is based on the faulty assumption that things are "level" in the first place. The truth is that some restaurants rely more heavily on business from smokers than do others. Why is it necessary to force diverse businesses to use a single, identical, one-size-fits-all policy?  4- It seems clear that most Americans want less interference from government. Yet, the California Restaurant Association is advocating greater governmental interference, in this case in the form of a smoking ban. Once you've opened the door to greater government control, isn't it awfully naive to think you can keep government out of other areas?  5- The free market has already provided an answer to this issue: In most communities, some restaurants are smoke-free, some are not. Customers have a choice.  What is wrong with that? Why shouldn't restaurant owners and managers be allowed to set their own policies, and allow smoking, even as they are currently free to ban it? If allowing smoking is risky, for one reason or another, why shouldn't owners and managers be allowed to choose to accept that risk? __label__Report

Cunningham SUBJECT: Elan Test Market Timing Confidential  Due to the decision last week to utilize reduced smoke product on Elan, Brand is recommending a one month delay in the Elan test market from June 27 to July 25. Doing so will resolve  several issues.  ° Final decision of tar and nicotine levels for reduced smoke,  ° Completion of initial testing with reduce smoke product. ° Availability of teartape calling out reduced smoke.  ° Sufficient lead time to incorporate reduced smoke in ali materials and ads. :  The following outlines timing parameters for all materials.  Management Materials - Brochure and folder have been already turned over for production without reduced smoke call out, however, this can be handled with a single page insert in the folder or on the Sell Sheets which are printed in Black &  White. Trade pieces do not carry T & N's so this is not an issue,  Richmond Materials - Both the sample 20's and 2 for 1 sleeves are in production in Richmond. Mark Walchak confirmed a last possible day for assembly of June 15 for an August test’ Market.  Advertising - Final decisions must be made by June 10 to meet closing and proofing dates. Once an ad is released it  cannot be changed.  Outdoor - Decision has been made to run approved outdoor. Only T & N must be changed. Final decision for August test is first week of June.  Point-of-Sale - As insurance we will produce two separate sets of point-of-sale materials for the first month. These  materials need to be put into production by mid-May.

Visual  ind, particularly, auditory signals have  Ween studied in considerable detail in a humber of species, but our knowledge of timate chemical communication is still elatively poor.  The South American marmosets and Lmarins are excellent models for the study of chemical communication. Their very hall body size and arboreal life style place tertain restrictions on the effectiveness  bf visual communication which may  have favored the use of chemical signals.  l species in this family possess highly bpecialized skin glands which are employed in scent marking. The subject of our research, the saddle-back tamarin  tndertaken long-term studies of the bommunicatory content and chemical tomposition of these scent marks, along with their role in some areas of social behavior.          Our aim is to determine how communicatory signals are encoded and how they are interpreted by recipients. Our studies have shown that the scent marks contain a detailed communicatory code which enables the recipient to obtain important information on the scent donor. The monkeys can discriminate between their own scent and that of several other callitrichid species and subspecies. Cues for male-female discrimination, and discrimination between castrated and normal males, are also present. Moreover, the monkeys discriminate between scents from dominant and submissive males, and between familiar male as well as female individuals. The scent may also contain cues which allow the tamarins to assess the period of time that elapsed since the scent mark was deposited. The interpretation of such information is influenced by the social context in which it is perceived, as well as by the previous experiences of the recipient. These factors, in turn, influence the responses to the scent.  The scent marks are chemically complex. The major volatile compounds are squalene, cholesterol and a series of butyrates. In addition, volatile compounds, as well as a number of high molecular constituents, among them proteins, are important in determining the sensory qualities of these highly complex “social perfumes.”  Collaborators: A. Belcher, L. Richards  QOQAGYS338  Chemistry of Aphrodisin  Alan Singer  My research interest is the chemical identification of mammalian pheromones, compounds that act via the chemical senses to help regulate social interactions in a population of mammals. An important motivation for this research is the expectation that identification of such compounds with a demonstrable and biologically important function will lead directly to advances in the understanding of the chemical senses by providing useful stimulus molecules for the study of structure-activity relations and for the investigation of peripheral chemoreceptor mechanisms.  The approach is interdisciplinary, collaborative, and it is based on the classical technique of chemical fractionation followed by biological assay, a process that is repeated until pure active compounds are isolated. These active compounds are then characterized by appropriate chemical and biochemical techniques for the analysis of molecular structure.  One result of this work has been the isolation and characterization of aphrodisin, a protein produced by female hamsters that acts on vomeronasal chemoreceptors to elicit sexual behavior from males. The structure of this protein shows that it is a member of a superfamily of extracellular proteins secreted by glands in numerous animal species, and most closely related to the recently described odorant-binding protein. Experiments on the behavioral and physiological activity of “synthetic” aphrodisin (produced by molecular cloning in bacteria) have already demonstrated that identification of authentic mammalian pheromones will lead to significant advances in research on the chemical senses.

Molecular mechanism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptors involvement in autoimmunity.  Project Description  We propose to study the regulatory role of TNF and its two receptors, TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, and the mechanism of the involvement of this cytokine in the pathogenesis and genetic predisposition to autoimmune disease.  Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), a prototypical human autoimmune disease, is a disorder of generalized autoimmunity characterized by multi-system organ involvement and autoantibodies against nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens. The mechanism(s) responsible for the breakdown of tolerance for these self antigens are unknown. In scarch for mechanisms responsible for immune dysregulation in SLE, cytokines have received increasing attention. One particular cytokine, TNF-o has an important protective role under the appropriate conditions in a mouse model of SLE, the (NZBxNZW)F1 mice.  The TNF genes, which include the TNFa, LTa, and the recently cloned LTB genes, are unique among all known cytokines and growth factors in that they are the only cytokine genes located within the central portion of the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC). Because of TNF's location, and because many of its potential biological activities are related to immunoregulation and inflammation, the possibility that an "abnormal" TNF gene could be involved in autoimmune diseascs was tested experimentally. | have shown that activated peritoneal macrophages from NZW mice produce 5- to 10-fold lower levels of TNFa. than non-autoimmune strains. Furthermore, this low TNF production was associated with a unique polymorphism in a simple tandem repeat sequence identified within the promoter region of TNFa. Most importantly, treatment of NZBxNZW mice with recombinant TNFo. caused a very significant reduction in the incidence of nephritis and other autoimmune disease parameters in the treated mice.  Further studies have revealed that: (1) TNF production is reduced also in a subset of patients with lupus, similarly to the (NZBxNZW)F1 mice that have an inherited lupus-like autoimmune diseasc. (2) Lupus patients with low TNF inducibility have a 3-5 fold increase in nephritis incidence; (3) In classical backcross experiments we showed that low TNF production in the NZW mouse is linked to the MHC,  In search of the mechanism of low TNF production in the lupus mouse, we have cloned and sequenced the 5’ regulatory regions from a total of 12 high- and low-TNF producer autoimmune and normal mouse strains as well as the 3'UTR of the TNF gene, from the stop codon at position 6215-6217 downstream (approximately 1.0 kb), in several strains. Several single bp mutations in the 5’region and nine sites were found to be associated with mutational events in the 3°UTR. The most interesting mutations were in the 3°UTR: a 5 base GACAC insertion at position 6381 and a 3 bp insertion of GAT, which disrupts the first AU-motif of TNFa. in the NZW mouse. To probe the functional relevance of the 5' regulatory regions and the 3'UTR mutations in the TNF gene, we have made constructs in which 5’ TNF promoter fragments from the low-TNF producer NZW mouse or from the high-TNF producer SWR mouse were linked to the luciferase reporter gene followed by 3'UTR sequences from the NZW mouse, or 3'UTR sequences from the non mutated SWR strain. The different constructs were transiently expressed in the RAW 264 cell line, activated with LPS and IFNy, and luciferase activity measured. Results published recently (J. Immunol. article enclosed) suggest that mutations in the 3’ untranslated region of the TNF gene may be primarily responsible for the genetic defect in NZW mice. It is noteworthy that, while luciferase activities are significantly reduced in the constructs with the 3'UTR originating from the NZW mouse, the level of luciferase mRNA is not affected suggesting that this is a post-transcriptional effect.  As a first step in investigating the regulatory mechanisms of TNF and their distinct signal transduction via each receptor, we considered isolation and characterization of the mouse receptors 10 be important. The cloning and sequencing of the TNF-R1 was recently completed and published.  We also cloned the mouse TNF-R2 and recently completed the sequence of the gene. We arc now in a strong position to be able to directly analyze and fully characterize the promoter of TNFR-2 in comparison with the promoter of TNFR-1. In parallel with cloning of the promoters of the receptors for regulatory studies, we have done regulatory experiments comparing the expression of the two TNF receptors using  50726195 __label__Scientific

R. J.

Unfortunately, no conclusions can be made in this regard.  While residues of endosulfan and maleic hydrazide were detected, these two pesticides are used/registered for use in several countries. Also, the residues are well below any of the limits that have been established in these countries. Furthermore, these two pesticides can be applied to more than one type of leaf. Though there are differences in pesticide formulations which may/may not account for residue content; the duration in the field, weather conditions,  etc., can impact the degradation of these pesticides. Lastly, the effects of blending can dilute the residue content in the final product.  Please let me know if] can be of further assistance to you.

¢ iw aa Ve Aesth Coumats om LMA: Bua f i he thelts brkckon 17 August 1998  Comments on Risk Mitigation Measures for Phosphine Fumigants  Peepared by: Inventa Corp., Pestcon Systems, Inc., & Degesch America, Inc.  Introduction .  ‘The present Applicator’s Manuals for metal phosphide fumigants were developed in the late 1980's as part of the Label Improvement Plan of the Reregistration Process. Substantial technical input for these Manuals was provided by the food industry, régistrants and EPA. Hours of discussions, careful thought and written communications, and arguments, led to the final document. The registrants believe that the Manuals have served well for their intended purpose - the safe and effective usc of phosphine fumigants for protection of stored commodities and for control of burrowing pests. Further, we believe that the present Manual and regulations do not need extensive revision and new risk mitigation measures should not be incorporated unless a need for them has been established on a scientific basis. Critical comments on the data base used in development of risk mitigation measures proposed by EPA have been made in the registrants’ 7 August 1998 submission to EPA entitled “Comments on EPA's Human Health Risk Assessment", dated 22 June 1998,  We feel that the present Manuals are readable, delineate all present-day requirements and, along with the certification program for training of persons applying testricted-use pesticides, have enabled the attainment of an excellent safety record, especially when compared with other fumigants.  1 Establishment of a Competent Person  Most or all of the suggested requirements listed by EPA in this section are already covered in the existing Applicator’s Manuals, Present labels require pre- inspection of the site and development of an overall plan for the fumigation by a certified applicator. This plan, in order to be a good plan must include placarding, notification, monitoriog and other tasks necessary for the safe and effective use of the fumigant. The registrants would have no objection to rewording sections of the present Manuals which, perhaps, might place more emphasis on this requirement. Copies of current Manuals can be provided to EPA, if requested.  There are two chilling suggestions made by EPA in this section on which the registrants would like to comment. The Girst is making the “competent person" legally liable for safe and effective use of the fumigant.

P. R. J. Burch Smoking and’ Lung Cancer: the Problem of Inferring Cause Jour. Royal Statistical Soc. A 141 (Pt. 4) 437-477 (1978)  Stating that the dogma that lung cancer is almost entirely due to cigarette smoking rests largely and necessarily on epidemiological studies, Professor Burch reviews the many methodological problems arising in epidemiology; such as the impossibility of randomizing for smoking, constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers, the heterogeneity of the human population, clinical diagnostic error changes, and the frequency association is identified with cause. Also, there is no comprehensive theory of carcinogenesis that as yet commands general acceptance. He then describes the association between smoking and lung cancer and their connection with sex and country. Secular trends in recorded mortality from lung cancer in England and Wales,  1901 to 1970, are derived from the Registrar General's statistics.  Estimates are made of the expected trends assuming that the assoctations found between the various types of smoking and lung cancer reflect causation. Observed and expected trends conflict. The secular trends in mortality  from lung cancer in British male doctors are also examined. He argues  that no definitive conclusions can be reached about the extent of any  causal link between smoking and lung cancer. It is very doubtful that  the entire association observed between smoking and lung cancer in occidental males should be interpreted in causal terms.     96n9 SILOS __label__Report

Resce  Extended Puff Count, Lower CO Delivery And Improved Conductive  Heat Transfer In TGA Models Using A Macrocapsule With Thermally Conductive Aluminum “Fingers”  Summary     The conduction--of heat from the burning fuel source in a TGA model back to the substrate (and tobacco) via an aluminun macrocapsule can be improved with the use of aluminum “fingers” which extend out from the macrocapsule and surround the fuel source. These fingers are actually part of the capsule but extend the length of the fuel source thus providing a ready path for the conduction of heat. Furthermore, this improved heat transfer serves to sink out more heat from the burning fuel thus lowering its combustion temperature. The result is two-fold: (1) the rate of carbon gasification is reduced and as a result the fuel is consumed at a slower rate, and (2) the production of CO via carbonaceous reduction of CO, is decreased because of the lower temperature maintained in the burning coal.  Background  Conductive heat transfer in a TGA model from a burning fuel source back to the substrate occurs chiefly through the aluminum macrocapsule. The fuel source is generally inserted only 1 or 2 mm inside the macrocapsule. The heat must travel from the burning fire cone, down the unburnt fuel rod and then across the 1 to 2 mm interface to the capsule. By improving the efficiency of this conductive heat transfer, more heat can be delivered to the substrate, sooner, thus permitting earlier flavor and/or aerosol delivery. The approach taken in this invention is to improve the interface between fuel source and macrocapsule. In this regard, a new type of macrocapsule is used which contains a number of finger-like protrusions which extend the length of the fuel source. The heat is transferred not only at the interface where  the fuel source is inserted into the capsule but also along these  92% $6595 __label__Letter

Kreisher  The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A, 110 East Fifty-Ninth Street  New York, New York 10022  Dear John:  I would Like to indicate for you some of my thoughts on the current Walton-Morrissey Smoking Machine, demonstrated at the March 9 meeting.  It is obvious that considerable thought and effort has gone into bringing the machine to its present state of development. From a mechanical viewpoint the design is simple, straightforward, and should require minimum maintenance. There are several design features I would like to comment on, some of which were discussed at the meeting.  The design of the inhalation chamber is such that smoke distribution within the chamber is a function of the smoke entrance velocity and the dilution air stream. Since the entrance velocity is constant, as the dilution air is decreased, the effective distribution must, there- fore, decrease. After the two second puff is terminated, the smoke begins to age for an interval equal to the exposure time. Due to the chamber design it also begins to settle to the bottom of the chamber where the concentration is increased. Dr. Rosenkrantz commented that animals in the lower area always expire first. Only a long term study would establish a definite pattern.  During the meeting, attention was brought to the close proximity of the cigarettes to each other. Dr. Rosenkrantz was to determine if the free burn rate is changed due to radiant heat. The current holder design is based upon the use of 45 mm diameter Cambridge pads which restricts the spacing of the cigarettes. As I pointed out to you at the time, 70 mm dia. Cambridge pads are available which would permit the cigarettes to be moved further apart.  A final point in question is the capillary entrance port. This design creates a potential for two physical changes to occur to the smoke  aerosol. As the smoke is compressed into the smail diameter tunnel, the chance for collision between particles is increased. If the  CTR CONTRACTS 009745  11229487 __label__Letter

Cleveland, Ph.D. ; . 087-36-3555 ene was active in the T-cell assay and well separated from the void peak (which might contain undigested material) was further fractionated by HPLC using a C18 reverse phase column. An active peak was then fractionated on a high resolution ion exchange column (Dionex, Omnipae NA-100), yielding six peaks, 5 of which were extremely sharp. Only one peak was active in the T-cell assay. Laser ionization mass spectroscopy by Dr. Brian Chait, Rockefeller University, revealed that this peak consisted of an incomplete digestion prod- uct having a molecular weight of 8612. Only a single molecular weight species was detected. N-terminal sequencing of the first 10 residues in the Howard Hughes Protein Core facility revealed a single sequence (xxLxxIxFQT) which was sufficient to identify the N-terminus of the ovalbumin peptide (ova 127). On the assumption that lysine was essen- tial (based on data not shown) , ova 185-207 was synthesized and found to be active. We are now synthesizing additional peptides to determine the boundaries of the epitope. Second, we have begun a determination of the v-region sequences of the B-lymphoma hy- bridoma (41-6.A7(1B9)). PCR amplified v-region cDNA has been ligated into a commer- cial vector . Clones with inserts of the correct size have been sequenced in the Cancer Cen- ter core facility. The heavy chain v-region sequence of the B-lymphoma fusion partner (A20.2J.PF) has been completed in this laboratory. To continue this work, we have begun a collaboration with Dr. Inghirami, a coinvestigator on this application, who has extensive experience with y-region sequencing. When the v-region sequences of the B-lymphoma hybrid are in hand, synthetic peptides based on these sequences will be tested with the T- cell hybridoma. If our hypothesis is correct, one of the v-region peptides should stimulate the ova-specific T hybrid. :  Aims. The first aim will be to complete the characterization of the ova epitope recognized by 32-6.F12, using synthetic peptides. ,  A second aim is to sequence the v-regions of the putative residue internal image B- lymphoma hybrid 41-6.A6(1.B9) in order to prepare synthetic v-region peptides. The resi-  due intemal image assignment requires the identification of a synthetic v-region peptide that is stimulatory for 32-6.F12.  A third aim will be to test our hypothesis that T-cell recognized internal images play a role in physiologic responses to foreign antigens. We will study fusions prepared with  splenocytes from unimmunized mice and mice undergoing primary and secondary respons- es to ovalbumin. .  A fourth aim will be to determine the degree of sequence homology between v-re- gion and ova peptides that is required for functional imagery. This is of great interest since  the frequency of residue intemal images in the repertoire will depend on the degree of homology required. : :  Budget: I estimate that this project can be completed in 3 years with annual direct costs of approximately $85,000, .     40021754 __label__Scientific
THE JOURNAL OF Bioacical. CHEMISTRY © 1993 by The American $ y for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.        Expression, Characterization, and Tissue Distribution of a New Cellular Selenium-dependent Glutathione Peroxidase, GSHPx-GI*  (Received for publication, March 26, 1992}  Fong-Fong Chut, James H. Doroshow, and R. Steven Esworthy From the Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research, City of Hope National Medical Center,  Duarte, California 91010  We have characterized a new selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, GSHPx-GI, by expressing a GSHPx-GI cDNA isolated from human hepatoma HepG2 cells in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells, which have virtually undetectable expression of either the classical cellular enzyme, GSHPx-1, or GSHPx-GI at the protein level. One of the G418-re- sistant clones, neo-D1, expresses the transfected GSHPx-GI cDNA. This is based on 1) the presence of an additional GSHPx-GI DNA restriction fragment detected by Southern analysis; 2) the presence of a 1.9- kilobase (kb) GSHPx-GI mRNA in addition to the 1.0- kb endogenous mRNA by Northern analysis; and 3) the appearance of a 22-kDa ™Se-labeled protein which is absent in parental MCF-7 cells revealed by SDS-poly- acrylamide gel electrophoresis.  GSHPx-GI expressed in neo-D1 is a tetrameric pro- tein localized in cytosol. GSITPx-GI does not cross- react with antisera against human GSHPx-1 or human plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-P). Similar substrate specificities are found for GSHPx-1 and GSHPx-GI; they both catalyze the reduction of H,Oo, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide with glutathione, but not of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. GSHPx-GI mRNA was readily detected in human liver and eolon, and occasionally in human breast samples, but not other human tissues including kidney, heart, lung, pla- centa, or uterus. In rodent tissues, GSHPx-GI mRNA is only detected in the gastrointestinal tract, and not in other tissues including liver. In fact, GSHPx-GI appears to be the major glutathione-dependent perox- idase activity in rodent GI tract. This finding suggests that GSHPx-GI could play a major role in protecting mammals from the toxicity of ingested ipid hydroper- oxides.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GSHPx- GI is the fourth member in the selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase family, in addition to GSHPx- 1, GSHPx-P, and phospholipid hydroperoxide gluta- thione peroxidase (PHGPX).     * This work was supported by American Heart Association Greater Los Angeles Affiliate, Grant-in-Aid 901 GI-2, and National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant CA 33572.

Tel.: 818-359-8111 (ext. 3891/2426); Fax: 818-301-8233.  Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity is due to the expression af multiple isozymes. Three of the isozymes have been previously purified and characterized at the protein level. They are: (a) the classical cellular glutathione peroxi- dase, GSHPx-1' (1), (b) the phospholipid hydroperoxide glu- tathione peroxidase, PHGPX (2), and (c) the plasma gluta- thione peroxidase, GSHPx-P (3, 4). Both GSHPx-1 and GSHPx-P are tetramers and have similar substrate specifici- ties. They can metabolize HQ. and fatty acid hydroperoxides effectively but metabolize phospholipid hydroperoxide and cholesterol hydroperoxide poorly (5, 6), On the other hand, PHGPX is a monomer and has different substrate specificities compared to GSHPx-1 and GSHPx-P. PHGPX catalyzes the reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxide, cholesterol hydro- peroxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide much more effec- tively than the reduction of H,O, and tert-butyl hydroperax- ide.  GSHPx-1 and PHGPX are present in most of the tissues that have been examined. GSHPx-1 is present abundantly in erythrocytes, kidney, and liver (7); and PHGPX is present in testis at a high level (8). On the other hand, GSHPx-P exhibits tissue-specific expression: it is detected in plasma, milk, and lung (3, 4, 9, 10). In humans, GSHPx-P mRNA is expressed in liver, kidney, heart, lung, placenta, and breast tissue: whereas, in the rodent GSHPx-P is not expressed in liver, although rodent kidney has a higher level of expression which may compensate for no GSHPx-P expression in liver (11). The cDNA sequence of these three glutathione peroxidase isozymes have been previously reported; they all contain a UGA codon coding for selenocysteine (12-15).  In addition to these three isozymes, a 24-kDa epididymal secretory protein homologous to glutathione peroxidase has been reported in mouse. This 24-kDa protein is inducible by testosterone, and it is only expressed in epididymis (16, 17). Since the published nucleic acid sequence of the 24-kDa protein does not contain a UGA codon, whether it should be included as an isozyme of the selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidases is debatable.  We isolated a GSHPx-GI clone from human liver and human hepatoma HepG2 cDNA libraries in Agt11; this CDNA shares sequence homology with GSHPx-L (18). The cDNA clone, GSHPx-GI, was subsequently reported by Akasaka et al. (19), who also isolated it from a human liver library. GSHPx-G1 cDNA contains a UGA codon; this suggests that it may be a fourth selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase isozyme. Because the protein product of GSHPx-GI had not heen identified, it was possible that GSHPx-GI was a pseu- dogene. In this report, we present data on the analvsis of     * The abbreviations used are: GSHPx, selenium-dependent gluta- thione peroxidase; PHGPX, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle's medium: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  2571 __label__Scientific

The Office of Technology Assessment memorandum released today demonstrates how little is known about the relationship of  personal behavior to disease and then, in turn, disease to costs.  Unfortunately, the staff of the OTA had little time to study this subject adequately.  If the report is supposed to provide a rationale for legislation earmarking a portion of the federal cigarette excise tax for Medicare, in our view it fails.  The report itself is littered with clever escape-hatch terms such as "estimate", "uncertainty", and "may", words normally used to hedge against legal action. Worse yet, it is based largely on fifteen to twenty-year-old figures, not statistics, lifted from fuzzy "studies" openly sponsored by front rank professional adversaries of tobacco. Could the desired conclusion have been determined in advance of the "study"?  Finally, this government bureau takes a position now, only two weeks before a consumer surtax on some tobacco products will be ended by law. This is blatant intervention confected and released by the staff of an agency to support a regressive tax increase which would cost the poor more than it costs the rich.  Lawmakers and opinion formers should read closely. They will recognize the specious, admittedly vague nature of this non-study. It is simply propaganda, a political press release requested by  one member of Congress.  If OTA does this kind of work in the vital defense and  security areas where it advises the Congress, we have a very  serious problem indeed.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Disturbances in hematopoiesis is a characteristic clinical finding in patients with AIDS. Patients present with abnormalities in one or more lineages resulting in neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The mechanisms by which HIV causes these disturbances are not known but are critical to an understanding of the hematologic pathobiology of the virus and the clinical management of patients with AIDS. In this grant, we propose to examine the molecular basis for our published findings of two mechanisms by which HIV can cause disturbances in hematopoiesis: direct suppression of progenitor cell growth and differentiation; and a negative effect on the accessory hematopoietic support function (HSF) of stroma cells. Using a murine embryonic stem cell (ES) line, as a model for stem cell development, and human stroma cell lines, transfection experiments will focus primarily on the role of the vpr regulatory gene in altering the developmental and functional properties of these hematopoietic cells. This focus is based on the observation: that vpr transfected into a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line can induce its differentiation. Thus, vpr may cause a disruption of the carefully regulated and coordinated processes of proliferation and differentiation that occurs during the development of progenitor cells into mature and functional progeny. A disruption in the function of stroma cells may similarly be affected by the activity of the vpr gene.  In their paper on HIV induction of rhabdomyosarcoma muscle celi line differentiation, Levi and co- workers showed that HIV expression leads to inhibition of the muscle cell's proliferation and the activation of the dormant endogenous differentiation Program. The effect was mediated by the regulatory vpr gene of the virus with its protein acting as a regulator of cell function. In discussing the implications of these findings, the authors speculate that “stem cell populations (e.g., skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, hematopoietic pre- cursors) are disrupted by vor and lose the ability to replenish tissues, leading to a gradual decline of mature effector population." Since some viruses can activate cellular genes in a variety of cells, it is reasonable to examine whether HIV regulatory genes can induce changes in the normal pattern of gene expression in hematopoietic progenitor celts and the accessory Cell function of stroma cells. Such an approach may provide evidence for the dysregulation of proliferation and differentiation as a mechanism of bone marrow suppress- ion, The authors also postulate that “cells that are subject to abortive infection, owing to an inability of the cells to support virus replication, nevertheless might be dysregulated by the activities of vpr.". Thus, non- productively infected cells of tissues that are not the usual targets of HIV in vivo, but are afflicted in AIDS patients, may be dysregulated in the absence of reverse transcription, integration, or residual viral nucleic acid. This may explain the consistent lack of evidence for a direct effect on progenitor cells in in vivo studies while in vitro experiments demonstrate that progenitor cells can be infected by HIV and their growth impaired. Though replication of the virus is, perhaps dogmatically, the yardstick by which a cell's tropism for HIV is measured, it is possible that abortive infection of a cell that is not the usual target of the virus can still alter the function of that cell. In this context, the marked suppression of progenitor cell growth in vitro following infection by hepatitis B virus correlates with only a transient replication of the virus in bone marrow cultures. We postulate, therefore, that while bone marrow progenitor cells or stroma cells may not be the primary target cell of HIV in situ, abortive infection may still have negative consequences on their development and function.  Our first aim is to determine whether the vpr gene of HIV is responsible for the suppression of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The mouse embryonic siem cell (ES) is a totipotential cell line that has the Capacity to develop into every tissue type when injected into host blastocysts. As such, it has become a valuable tool in the study of hematopoiesis and its molecular biology, and so will be used as a developmental model of hematopoiesis in these studies. Several characteristics of ES cells make it a good model to define the role of vpr (and other regulatory genes) in stem cell suppression, and a good substitute for primary bone marrow derived CD34+ cells whose use in similar studies may be technically more difficult. Since ES cells are a pure population of truly totipotential cells, they can be used to gain insight into the biological significance of novel genes, and dissect the molecular processes that occur during the early events of commitment, self-renewal, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, in vitro techniques have been developed to study hematopoietic cell differentiation in ES cells, and the profile and pattern of genes activated during this process have been characterized and are consistent and reproducible. Thus, the expression of genes involved in the early stages of hematopoiesis precede those required for the terminal stages of differentiation. Alterations in the normal process of differentiation is reflected in a distorted profile of gene expression. These observations are relevant to the proposed study. Finally, based on our studies on studies of the vav proto-oncogene, genes of particular interest can be readily and stably  50647413 __label__Scientific

Expression of the Transcription Factor NFATp in a Neuronal Cell Line and in the Murine Nervous System*  (Received for publication, March 30, 1994, and in revised form, August 8, 1994)  Andrew M. Hoi, Jugnu Jain§1, Anjana Rao§t, and Patrick G. Hogan:|  From the EDepartment of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, the §Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Department of Patholagy, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115  The transcription factor NFATp, which has a central role in cytokine gene induction inT cells, was previously thought to be expressed only in T cells and other im- mune cells. Here we report that NFATp is also expressed in the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line and in the murine nervous system. Antisera against T cell NFATp recognize proteins of similar apparent molecular weight in T cells, PC12 cells, and murine olfactory bulb. The immunoreactive proteins from PC12 cells and from ol- factory bulb bind to an NFAT site of the murine inter- leukin-2 promoter with the same specificity as T cell NFATp. Immunohistochemical staining localizes NFATp to neurons, specifically to olfactory receptor neurons and to their terminals in the olfactory bulb. The pres- ence of NFATp in the nervous system suggests that it has arole in the transcription of specific neuronal genes in response to increases in cytosolic calcium.  ee  The transcription factor NFATp is essential for transcription of cytokine genes in activated T cells (1-7). NFATp cooperates with Fos and Jun family proteins in the nucleus of stimulated T cells to activate transcription of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)! gene (8-11) and acts in concert with these or other transcription fac- tors to increase transcription of other cytokine genes (3, 4, 6, 12). NFAT p was originally identified as the “preexisting” component of the inducible nuclear factor NFAT (8, 13-15); its activation in T cells depends on a caleium/calmodulin/caleineurin signaling pathway and is sensitive to cyclosporin A and FK506 (15, 16). NEATp is a phosphoprotein of apparent molecular mass ~120 kDa (11, 15, 17), which exists in T cells as several isoforms aris- ing from alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts (18).  ‘A nuclear factor similar or identical to NFATp has also been identified in B ceils (2, 19-21). Extracts of unstimulated B cells contain factors that bind to the distel NFAT site of the IL-2 promoter and form a complex on this site with Fos and Jun family proteins (19). As in T cells, the activation of NFAT is initiated by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is pre- vented by treatment of the cells with cyclosporin A (20, 21). Antisera against T cell NFATp recognize the protein-DNA com- plexes from B cells” and identify proteins comparable in appar- ent molecular weight to T cell NFATp in Western analysis of B cell proteins.’ Recent work has documented the presence of     * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant CA4!471 {to A.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not detect proteins that bind to an NFAT oligonucleotide in brain or liver extracts (22). In trans- genic mice, expression of a reporter gene under control of a multimer of the NFAT site was restricted almost entirely to activated T cells and B cells and was not apparent in brain (22). On the other hand the components of the caleium/calmodulin/ caleineurin pathway that activates NFATp in T cells are abun- dantly expressed in the brain (23, 24), Likewise, Fos, Jun, and other transcription factors that combine with NFAT» in T cells are induced in neural cells by growth factors and other physi- ological stimuli (25-29).  Here we have reexamined the possibility that NFATp is ex- pressed in neural cells. We present evidence that NFATp is expressed by the PC12 cell line, a rat adrenal chromaffin tumor cell line (30) that has been used in studies of intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, and neuronal differentia- tion. Further, we demonstrate that NFATp is present at rela- tively high levels in the murine olfactory bulb, largely in ter- minals of olfactory receptor neurons, and may be expressed at lower levels in certain other regions of the murine central nerv- ous system.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Cell Culture—PC12 cells were maintained in L.15CO2 medium with 7% horse serum, 7% fetal calf serum, and other additives as described (31). Murine T cell clones Ar-6 and CLL7W2 were grown as described (32).  Antisera—The principal antiserum used in these experiments was affinity-purified antiserum against peptide 67.1 (AISSPSGLAYPDDV- LDYGL), a sequence located near the N terminus of murine NFATp. Antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with the peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and was purified hy affinity chromatography on a resin (Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad) bearing immobilized peptide 67.1. Other reagents used were antisera against the peptides 67.2 and 72 (18) and an antiserum directed against a recombinant frag- ment af NFATp that includes the DNA-binding domain (18). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG (F(ab’), fragment) was from Cappel; Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit-IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; and normal rabbit Ig (Pentex rab- bit gamma globulins, fraction [1) was from Miles Laboratories.  SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Aualysis— Cytosolic extracts from PC12 cells and from T cells were prepared as previously described (15). Spleen and the indicated brain regions were dissected from 3- to 4-week-old mice and were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mat NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 ma EDTA, 100 pg/ml suybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 yg/ml aprotinin, 250 us leupeptin, 10 mm iodo- acetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 0.3 g, wet tissue weight/ml. 10% SDS was added to bring the final concentration of SDS to 2%. The solution was boiled for 10 min and then centrifug: d for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was collected. Pretein con- ventration in the samples was determined with bovine serum albumin as standard (33).     +4. Raghavan and P. G. Hogan, unpublished data.  28181 __label__Scientific
Tobacco - Europe  FRANCE: CAN THE EVIN BILL ON TOBACCO BE APPLIED?     La Tribune Desfogses, 12 Jul 1995, p.29:-  CNCT,< a French association in charge of making sure that the Evin bill on limiting advertisement on tobacco and alcoholic products is enforced properly, >is being involved in a number of legal issues with tobacco makers in France.  This its because the tobacco manufacturers are bypassing the Evin bill, which proves to be difficult to enforce.  In addition to contesting a number of statements of the bill, like arguing that it is a hindrance to personal Freedom, the tobacco makers keep presenting scientific surveys which tend to prove that tobacco cannot damage health.  CNCT algo fights this, arguing that the studies are biased owing to the fact that tha tobacco makers finance them. The association denounced recently a study by Jean-Jacques Rosa of IEP<, the French institute of political studies>, which showed that tobacco was more profitable than damageable to the community. The study was financed by CDIT, the French entity which supplies information and documentation on tobacco>.  (ESMERK/FRENCH/ER .

nun INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM . TO G. W. McKenna FROM M. D h SE C R a : ° . n : ° a n : No "34  Information is attached with regard to Evolutionary and  Revolutionary second generation programs. Both programs are similar in that they target low/no CO and glass replacement as  key objectives. The Revolutionary program additionally seeks to simplify manufacturing, while the Evolutionary program targets product development around designs that are consistent with first generation manufacturing concepts.  Abbreviated action plans are provided for each product concept. Certain dates involving other departments were assumed based on usual time frames. These dates are, therefore, subject to approval and agreement.  As you will notice, there are a multitude of product concepts. This number will probably expand even more before it begins to focus on key opportunities. Decision dates are, therefore, built into the plans, where possible.  The thing that becomes most obvious in reviewing the product concepts is the need for (1) good and innovative consumer research and (2) a sound and, perhaps, entrepreneurial business perspective to realize the greatest possible profit potential  from the unique technology that we now possess. This technology provides the opportunity of developing a wide variety of smoking  products where the profit potential is immense. It is critical that this technology be married to an innovative consumer  research program that is capable of identifying market opportunities for non-traditional smoking products.  ADS  M. D.

October 30, 1987  MR. J. DOUG SIMPSON  SUBJECT: Funding For Air Purification Device Development, Prototype Construction, and Testing  Assisting in the Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) investigation for Fundamental Research and Development Department at Bowman Gray Technical Center (BCTC), we have designed subject device. Development and testing of this device has the potential of reducing the impact of “ETS” in public buildings particularly food service and entertainment establishments.  We are requesting a grant of $4500 to accomplish subject work. To the best of our knowlewdge at this time these funds will cover the cost of engineering, materials and labor required to fabricate a prototype and testing to develop effectiveness data for this device.  Legal council at BGTC is presently investigating patentability of subject device. A decision should be reached by mid November on this matter.  If this funding is granted and we are advised to proceed with this work the prototype can be constructed and ready for testing by January 1, 1988.  Please advise as to how we can further assist you in this matter.  Gi  Richard P. Lortie, P. &.      RPL: gws (33 76v)  Copy to: Je: Cc. Henderson Cc. W. Nystrom  L76T CbPTS __label__Letter
CC: DRS. Raman. SYERCE, MoALT Is     Name: Martha C. Nowycky, Ph.D. Title: Nicotinic Receptors: Role in Secretion of Catecholamines from Chromaffin Cells  Grant #: 4373  Reviewer: Pierce  Critique  This proposal appears to be a fine tuning of what is already known about the opening of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channels resulting in non specific cation flow and depolarization of cells. Calcium influx is obligatory for the exocytotic fusion of catecholamine-containing granules with the plasma membrane. The Pl has found that opening nicotinic catecholamine reactors by puff application of nicotine triggers exocytosis which is regulated by calcium contribuled from intracellular stores. There are 3 such pools: an IP3 sensitive store, a caffeine sensitive store and an IP3-and caffeine-sensitive store. She noticed that the exocytotic response to standard depolarizing voltage pulses that open calcium channels was potentiated after the cell had been exposed to nicotine. This potentiation did not require extracellular calcium, persists for 10 minutes and again, she believes that the mechanism may include activation of specific intracellular stores. Similar potentiation of depolarization-induced secretion was observed when cells were exposed to thapsigargin which elevates calcium in bovine chromaffin cells. The PI is proficient in patch clamping and with her associate, Dr. Formina, has studied the effect of nicotine on depolarized evoked secretion and she postulates that the mechanism may involve specific intracellular calcium stores. She will use a perforated patch mode to study secretion in the absence of cell dialysis which allows enough time for the slow run down observed in whole cells, which will enable her to study the potentiation effects. The strategy is to deplete or block the various intracellular calcium stores, and then study the reactions in the presence of nicotine. She will also determine which second messenger systems participate in nicotine triggered secretion.  The experiment seems logical and are in the hands of a person capable of carrying them out. Iam ambivalent about these experiments and would recommend a priority of about 1.8 but could be moved in either direction by Dr. Sabatini.  Recommendation  Approval with priority of 1.8.

te tnemete nes  Lorillard  MEMORANDUM  January 22, 1990  MEMORANDUM TO THE FILE: Tobacco Institute Executive Committee  At the 1/17/90 meeting of the TI Executive Committee in California, the Plan outlined in the attachment was presented, discussed and approved.  Pursuant to instructions from Mr. A. Tisch, who was not in attendance, I questioned at length, and in detail, the extent to which any of the proposed $6,649,000 budget, which includes a $1,000,000 contingency, could be met from already budgeted 1990 TI programs. After lengthy discussion, and responses from Mr. Chilcote that the overall costs could possibly be less if extensive telephone banks and some polling research were not to become necessary, the program was approved.  Mr. Johnston, as Chairman, indicated that as costs for the program are developed and assigned, the Staff is instructed to make a good faith effort to allocate some of the costs to existing budget slots. The latter assurance was given in response to my strenuous urging tht the costs be met through the existing budget. Those demands were made by me at Mr. Tisch’s instructions, with the understanding that if I failed to convince the TIEC membership to our view, I was authorized to vote for the project as a special assessment, "out of budget" program. I did so vote.  I requested Mr. Johnston to telephone Mr. Tisch upon his return from California to discuss the Executive Committee’s deliberations, and informed Mr. Tisch of the Committee’s actions during a discussion with him on 1/22/90.

Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA  (Received 3-11-1988; accepted 15-11-1988)  Summary — Nicotine was found to markedly potentiate haloperidol-induced hypokinesia in rats. Nicotine alone was without effect. Subsequently, concurrent administration of 2 mg nicotine gum to 10 Tourette syndrome patients being treated with haloperidol produced a substantial decrease in tics and improvement of concentration and attention span. Nicotine gum alone was without effect. While 80% of children showed improvement with nicotine gum, 70% completely discontinued the gum because of side-effects, primarily involving nausea and bitter taste.  Nicotine may prove useful for treating other neuroleptic responsive disorders, such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease.  nicotine / haloperidol / Tourette syndrome  Résumé — Potentialisation par ta nicotine des effets de "halopéridol chez les animaux et les malades atteints du syndrome de Tourette. J/ a déjd eté constaté que ta nicotine potentialise netiement l'effet cataleptique de Thalopéridol chez le rat. La nicotine seule est en revanche sans effet. Par conséquent, ladministration de 2 mg de nicotine sous forme de chewing-gum a des malades atteints de syndrome de Tourette et déjd traités par halopéridol entraine une réduction notable des tics et ameliore la durée de concentration et d'attention. Le chewing-gum @ la nicotine utilisé seul est encore sans effet.

La nicotine peut se montrer utile dans le traitement d autres troubles justiciables d'un traitement neuroleptique telles la schizophrénie et la maladie de Huntington.  nicotine / halopéridol / syndrome de Tourette  Introduction  Tourette syndrome is a complex disorder invol- ving long-term motor and vocal tics which is commonly treated by administration of haloperi- dol. However, there is now considerable caution about the long-term use of this neuroleptic, particularly in view of the risk of later tardive dyskinesia. In addition, a number of those recei- ving this medication frequently complain about the side effects of akathisia, drowsiness, separa- tion anxiety syndrome and impairment of concen- tration during schoolwork [4]. It is therefore important to investigate any agent which could  potentiate the beneficial effects of haloperidol, and thereby reduce the amount of this neuroleptic needed while retaining the desired effects. Ideally, such an agent could also increase concen- tration and attention, given the high comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with Tourette disorder. The present paper describes research demonstrating the potential of nicotine as an adjunctive therapy with neuroleptics. Recently, Moss et al. (10, 11] demonstrated that nicotine produced powerful increases in reser- pine-induced hypokinesia in rats. We were inte- rested in whether nicotine could also potentiate the behavioral effects of the dopamine receptor     50609172 __label__Scientific

As we see it now, let's plan to stop our buydowns, except for Monarch, and stop couponing as of August 19, 1993: the 20th is a Regional Holiday.  im We will supply you weekly with a Grid reflecting chains and what date they plan to reduce their prices. At that time, we should make these calls for rollback P.O.S.  only - no couponing.  m We also discussed 'Brand Distribution’ in light of MBOs, etc. Obviously, some items will get lost in the shuffle; however, it is our job to protect our hard-fought for distribution and not simply - and randomly - discontinue items. A few exceptions exist; i.e., Doral Non-Filter and some of the Sterling Kg brands.  i» As discussed, Monarch Box offers excellent opportunities and should be a high  priority. Individual MBOs will be reviewed during W/Ws; however, don't plan on throwing in the towel, so to speak. Brand distribution will still be viewed as a part of  MBOs and evaluations in general.  As an example, enclosed is a Division Comparison, reflecting distribution and product availability.  It's ‘good news’, ‘bad news' time.  Our Division distribution and product availability in chains and independents on these specific brands is pretty much in line; however, our distribution in independents overall is the lowest in the Region, and our product availability on entry, reflecting out-of- stocks, is way off the mark. Please review these numbers, and let's address improved stock levels in every call. A sure way to do it is to set a goal of either a prebook or orderbook order for every account called on, every time you make the call.  uw ke ~) ee Ww W ~~ © an __label__Report

Here is one item we wanted to discuss:  e Diamond Shamrock - The issue here is to have everyone on board with the same plan.  I spoke today with R. P. Dotson, and H. J. Heintz in San Antonio. They had planned to call Diamond Shamrock today (though did not get through) to resolve the issues with Hogshead. H.J. was was able to set up an appointment with Jim Manning for this Friday.  As per discussions with David Owens last week, R. P and H. J. were going to propose that Diamond Shamrock accept Hogshead and sell it in their generic branded savings display, alongside Doral. They would not benefit from the $0.50/carton deal. I do not believe that would give Hogshead due chance for success.  According to R.P., I am not sure with the merchandising contract we have with Diamond Shamrock that we will be able to ‘force’ them into accepting the Hogshead display as another footprint.  At a meeting today with Jim Helm, Kathryn Noxon and Michelle Soyars, we discussed the idea of having Diamond Shamrock accept the temporary Hogshead counter display and switch it out with existing RJR displays. For example, have the Hogshead display up for a month instead of Doral, and for another month instead of Select, Camel, etc.  e That leads to the idea of a test within a test - to determine exactly what impact having full retailer support has on the success of the brand. Testing the success of Hogshead with a retailer who does not support the brand, versus testing it with retailers who do, i.e. full partners Circle K and NCS supporting the brand against a Diamond Shamrock more conventional approach.  We could potentially have a similar situation in Pittsburgh, with UniMart. I just wanted you to be aware of the situation, and wanted to hear your reaction/recommendation.  uw e ib H aa a N © Ww __label__Letter

LUKE’S MEDICAL CENTER  17632 WEST CONGRESS PARKWAY, CHICAGO 60612 D” ti Y DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY  December 20, 1977  Dr. Vincent Lisanti Associate Research Director The Council for Tobacco Research-USA, Inc.  110 East 59th Street New York, New York 10022  re: Grant Application #1133M     Dear Dr. Lisanti:  The original proposal (#1133M) included studies on endo- thelial cells and platelets. However, due to decreased : funding for the period July 1977 thru June 1978, progress @ on several of the important long term aims has been sev- erely impeded, This has resulted in a drastic change of research priorities and has necessitated the deletion of studies pertaining to platelets from this proposal.  Dr. Wu has submitted a separate proposal (including a sep- arate budget and progress report) dealing with platelets only. These are two separate, independent and unrelated proposals and should be evaluated as such. Independent budgets and possible budgetary cuts will effect either endothelial cell studies or platelet studies and will not require reallocation of decreased funds and hence decreased productivity or elimination of specific aims in either of the research areas. These two important research areas should not have to compete for available funds within the same grant proposal.  We would appreciate your consideration of this problem and the two separate proposais. If you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me,  Sincerely     rd) Associate Professor        50128017 __label__Letter

1992 SECOND QUARTER REPORT  Timothy B. Nestor July 8, 1992  1. Evaluate the effects of air flow and’ oxygen concentration on ignition propensity. ” a. Develop an enclosure and evaluate effects of air flow. (2Q).,  Due to a change in priorities, work’ involving the "Localized Air Flow" apparatus*was delayed until late June. Currently, cigarettes G and J are being used to determine the appropriate levels of Kt on California standard fabric. Once the fabrics have been chosen, an « experiment willbe conducted using air flows of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 cm/sec.  b. Complete evaluation of O, effects at constant flow rate and flow effects at constant 0, on "Flow- Through" method with selected TSG cigarettes. (2Q)  The objective of this study was to determine whether the "Flow-Through" method could discriminate between selected  _ "remake" TSG cigarettes. Cigarettes 506 (BELN-21), 529 (FELC-25), 525 (FNLC+25), and 528 (FNHN-25) were selected for testing. These cigarettes represent a wide range of ignition propensities as reported by the TSG.  Ignition test results of cigarettes 506, 529, 525, and 528 on UFAC type II fabric at various air flow rates are shown in Table I. Ten replicates were run at each point and are represented by a percent ignition in the table (i.e. #/10). A well-defined differentiation between cigarettes was not observed. This can be seen in Figure I, a plot of percent ignitions versus air flow rate for all cigarettes. A formal analysis of variance has not been performed on the data; however, one could generalize that the cigarettes performed similarly at low flow rates, and cigarettes 525 and 528 produced more ignitions then 506 and 529 at the higher flow rates.  The results do not indicate a wide range of ignition propensities as reported by the TSG. Because of this, work involving various 0, percent has been postponed.  P8O@L LECTS __label__Report

Livilld  MEMORANDUM December 18, 1987 TO: Vv. D. Lindsley J FROM: E. F. DeLaura RE: -~DA ~WEEK T  Attached are some key findings from Harley's initial test market performance in Terre Haute, Indiana.  KGROUND  Harley-Davidson cigarettes were introduced in test market in early September of this year. The brand was moderately sampled and supported by newspaper and FSI inserts during its first few  months.  DESIGN  A 12-week AAU was conducted in mid-November among non-menthol, Lo-Fi/Low Tar smokers which were further defined by the following  specifications:  Target Group - Males, 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of college  Additional Sub-G  - Males 50 yrs. and older  - Males 18-49 better educated  - Females 18-49 yrs., less than 2 yrs. of college  MRD_ NOTE  Please note that prior to the AAU, Lorillard's Telemarketing Program was conducting its screening for its two carton free- offer in Terre Haute. Although no product (Harley) had been dropped, the incentive post card for the free cartons was mailed to those who had been screened. There is the likelihood that some of the respondents in the AAU received the Harley carton offer prior to the AAU interviewing. Thus, awareness levels may have been affected by this mail-in offer; no estimate can be  made.  LSL8EP0L8 __label__Memo

Clemente  Acting Executive Director  NYS Temporary Commission ou Lobbying 2 Empire State Plaza, Suite 1701  Albany, New York 12223  Re; 1995 lobbying activities of the Tobacco Institute Dear Mé. Clemente:  We are requesting that the Lobby Commission investigate whether an epregious omission in lobby disclosures for 1995 was made by the tobacco industry, its trade association and their lobbyists. Information made public az a result of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the State of Minnesota against cigarette manufacturers provides disturbing ovidence of a tobacco industry campaign to kil! tebacco contro} legislation in New York State,  According to the 1996 budget of the Tobarco Institute, the trade association for the : tohacco industry, an expenditure of $279,700 was made in 1995 for something denominated as : the "New York State Preemption Plan." This item is reported om page 3-17 in the 100-plus page budget. The liew ix assigned to the Nationa! Headquarters "Spectal Projects” Account. The budget provides spending by line item for 1996 md includes 1995 spending figures. spparently for comparison purposes. In fight of the fact that this entry appears in a document dated October 27, 1995, which provides hudget as wall as estimate entries for 1995 spending, indiootes that the monies identified were actually being spent. (A copy of the budget document ie attached hereto.)  The $279,700 expenditure for the New York State Preemption Plan” is reported separately and appears to be in addition to routine lobbying expenses reported on pages 3-10 and : 4.14, and in addition to other expenditures including donations to accociated business ‘ organizations, campaign contributions and professional fees.  Preemption by the state of laws and regulations enacted by local government is 3 primary stiateyy of the tobacco Industry as it attempts to frustrate and overturn efforts to regulate the use and marketing of tobacco products, Evidence that the Tobacco Institute clneely tracked the  progress of state preemption legislation is provided by a May 1993 Tobasco Institute document tracking the progrees of such bills in a number of states.

Lanzillotti  Monthly Report, Project Delta - April 1982  Objectives:  1. Provide experimental data for nontobacco smoking article patent application.  2. Conduct experiments on the use of heat to transfer flavor.  3. Conduct experiments to measure the transfer efficiency of flavorants from tobacco to smoke.  4. Prepare reports on extrusion technology and the preparation of nontobacco combustible heat sources.  Conclusions:  1. A meeting was held on the fifteenth of April with Bob Shaw to discuss our application for a patent on nontobacco smoking articles. Bob is now preparing the application based on information supplied at the meeting. Experiments are being conducted which will supply additional data requested.  2. The electric cigarette has been used to generate a smoke aerosol from after-cut solution. Initial measurements show that a typical after~cut taste is produced when the gas stream temperature is 150°C. When the gas stream temperature is raised to 200°C the taste degenerates to a burned sugar character. Additional experiments are being conducted to measure the temperature of the solution during heating under each of the above conditions.  3. Our G.C. has been fitted with two new columns in order to enhance our ability to measure the concentration of flavors in TPM extracts. The system is being recalibrated for the new columns.  4. Information from our notes is being assembled for reports on various aspects of experimental efforts during the course of Project Delta. One special report on binderless extrusion has been prepared and others on foamed tobacco, combustible heat sources, the delivery of extruded tobacco, and the taste of extruded tobacco articles, are being written.

Meeting Minutes - Park 500 NPDES Permit  A meeting was held at Park 500 on August 14 at 2:00 to discuss the draft NPDES wastewater discharge permit received from the State Water Control Board.  Attendees: G. L. Hill W. E. Poorbaugh B. E. Honts J. N. Tenhet J. J. Petchul J. T. White  W. P. Pitts  The following is a brief summary of the major issues dis- cussed at the meeting. Any attendee wishing to correct or add to these minutes should contact the author.  1. Phosphorus (P) is the only controlled parameter which has both a mass (in pounds) and a concentration (in parts per million) limit. Together, these two limits Place a cap on our maximum flow. The P concentration limit is fixed by state regulation at 2.0 mg/L but we should ask the SWCB to drop the P mass limit or increase it if we plan to increase our flow.  2. The question concerning growth at Park 500 and waste- water plant expansion for the next five years must be addressed immediately. Unless we request additional flow in September, we will be committed to our existing flow of 2.2 mgd. This will very likely prevent any expansion at Park 500 unless another permit is negoti- ated and possibly until more wastewater treatment capacity is added. State rules and attitudes and Park 500’s physical situation have all changed in the last year. Three years ago we were able to start construc- tion on the Bermuda Project without waiting nine months for a permit. We will not be able to do that again.  It is important to use this occasion to expand Park 500’s treatment capacity if there will be justifiable need in the next five years.  JNT89052 -il1-     e99V*Tprcoe __label__Memo

Specifically, Boffetta apparently makes two claims.  First, that we have drawn conclusions from the studies which are not consistent with those stated or intended by the authors.  Second, that it is inappropriate to compare conclusions from a meta~analysis of ETS with single study findings.  Richard suggested that you begin to consider responses to these allegations. In the meantime, we'll let you know if we learn more about the article and will see if it is possible to obtain an early copy.

CHARGE NUMBER: Project. 1901  PROJECT TITLE: Biochemical Modification of Tobacco PERIOD COVERED: September 1-30, 1985  PROJECT LEADER: 0D. M. Teng  DATE OF REPORT: October 7, 1985  I. Flue Curing Studies  Objective: Alter conventional flue curing condition by maintaining sufficient moisture in the leaf at elevatedi temperature to enhance the leaf  proteases activities so the modification of leaf protein will be more complete.  Status: Total of four sets of experiments were completed. Test curings were conducted at high temperature-high humidity condition for different  periods of time. The lamina and stems were then directly dried, using the conditions for normal stem drying.  Plans: 1. Stem the samples  2. Chemical analyses. 3. Biochemical evaluations. 4, Subjective evaluations.     II. Air Curing Studies  Objectives: To determine the effect of moisture on air-curing of burley tobaccos.  Status: Burley tobacco plants were stalk-cut and hung in chambers, with four moisture levels, for air-curing. Air-curing willl continue for the next six to eight weeks.  Plans: . Complete the air curing.  Sample during different stages of curing. Chemical analyses.  - Subjective evaluations.     1  2] . 3 4 III. Direet Utilization of Tobacco  Objective: To determine the feasibility of producing acceptable smoking materials with improved chemical, biochemical andi subjective characteristics without going through conventional curing.  Status: Control and Ethryl-treatedi tobaccos were dried andi shredded. Stemming, drying and shredding were conducted by the Development personnel.  Plans: 1. Tobacco materials will be treated under different conditions and then submitted for chemical, biochemical and subjective  evaluations.

620507831  PRODUCED FROM BéW WE                    INVESTIGATION OF SMOKE AEROSOL  BY  —  ELECTRON-MICROS COPY  PART VII  February 1966  A characteristic property of smoke aerosol droplets is their ability under certain conditions to separate into two virtually distinct phases. In most of our work to date we have devoted our attention to the use of screens and methods of collection that avoided this separation, because we were hoping to get information bearing on the aerosol particles as they actually are in the free state. Even when we found that passage through a carbon filter increased the tendency of the droplets to spread we endeavoured to use screens which limited this to spreading of the droplet as a whole and stopped short of phase separation.  We discussed “spreading” in some detail on pp. 7, 8, and 9. of our report PART V. April 1965, and we include at Plate I. of that report a reproduction of a photograph showing what we there termed “a typical case of advanced spreading". In this case the spreading was due to the aerosol having passed through a charcoal filter. We have now carried out some further experiments which) while preliminary, suggest how this phenomena might be further investigated.  6<0507851 __label__Memo

The accepted means of measuring these two parameters is discussed below, and some representative data pertaining to commercial and experimental cigarette filters are discussed.  Pressure drop is that quantity obtained when the pressure differential between two points is determined. In the case of cigarette filters, it is the pressure difference between the two ends of the filter at a normal air flow of 17.5 cc./fsec. at IS°R. and 1 atmosphere. The pressure difference is usually expressed in centimeters or inches of water. Most filter tips in use fall within the range of 2.0-12.0 cm. of HO. ‘ Efficiency of a cigarette filter is a measure of the fraction of smoke retained by the filter. If we use  the notation S, to represent the smoke presented to  the filter, and Sy the smoke passing the filter, the’ efficiency (Ee) may be expressed as  S, may be measured by smoking cigarettes under standard conditions (35 ec puff, 2-scecond duration, leminute frequency, at 75°F and 60% relative humidity) and obtaining the dry TPM yield according to the procedure employed by the FTC. 5S, is measuxed on cigarettes smoked to the same butt length as for Sy put with the filter matexial removed from the tip.

Hewitt, co-directors of UC!’s Reconstructive Microsurgery and Transplantation Laboratory. The research team also included Dr. David Furnas, chief of plastic sur-~, gery, and Dr. Bruce Achauer, a plastic surgeon and director of the burn unit at UCI Medical Center.                       the National Institutes of Health, were published recently in the journal, Transplantation.  Black, a bio-engineer, said the” findings are encouraging.  “This research could spark a revol- ution in transplant surgery,” he said. “For the first time, we have shown that tissues of this kind can be transplanted for long terms of survival in animals,” oo.  But he added, “The bottom line is that there’s still a lot of work to do before we can apply this clinically in people.” :  He said the transplant research at UCI has taken place over the past six years.  “Most of the success has been attributed to cyclosporine,” | Blac! said, referring to as anti-rejection drug discovered in the mid-1970s.     Cyclosporine allows the body to protect itself against infection, but suppresses the part of the immune system invoived in the rejection of transplanted tissue. In humans, the drug has been used to help prevent rejection in kidney, bone marrow, heart-lung, pancreas and liver trans- plants.  Black said the UCI experiments determined that the drug could also help in composite tissue transplants. The tests also focused on how much cyclosporine was needed and what  side effects the-drug -migh' Finally, the researchers found that the transplanted tissues could survive for the duration of the animal’s life.  The transplanted rat legs showed signs of near-normal .muscle and nerve activity. But the limbs did not function completely — the rats could not walk normally on the tranplanted. legs —- because of the complexity of reconnecting the nerves and muscles required for such movement.  The rats used in the UCI tests normally have a three-year life span. Black said some of the rats that underwent leg transplants lived as long as 700 days after the surgery.  He said researchers were able to  accomplish the transplants with rela- tively low dosages of cyclosporine, an important finding because the drug can be toxic at high levels, The finding that the transplant limbs survived after discontinuing cyclosporine was unexpected, and the UCI scientist said additional studies are planned. While functional human limb transplants are years away, Black said the UCI experiments may have more immediate implications in the re- placement of large areas of skin, muscle, blood vessels and bone damages by burns, gunshot wounds or other injuries. He said such tissue grafts could eventually replace the prosthetic devices used today.  50288669  it haven...  umans __label__News

Wick > s Vice President, Operations J P RY Rm  December 4, 1986  MEMO TO: Mr. Richard Morgan Director, Quality Assurance  SUBJECT: Lamina Particle Size  We've had several questions about why we're looking for increased particle size in stemming and there has been some work done to illustrate that larger  particle size improves filling power.  My position has been that we're looking for a cleaner product in pneumatic separation to reduce stem particle “choke ups" in high speed machinery and that we're reducing the smaller scrap level of particle size which gener- ally equates to product waste in the end. From this, if we achieve a higher filling capacity with larger particle size, that's a bonus feature.  Anyway, this discussion with our Research people in Canada produced some good discussions. , * /  { ‘         HGW/ fb1  cc: Mr. L. C. Cook Mr. L. G. Hannemann Mr. C. E. Snyder Mr. R. E.

Test Method  A paired two cigarette mall intercept test was conducted by Dwight Spencer and Associates. L-11,942A was compared to L-12,059B by 60 Hi-Fi (less than 15 mg.) smokers. These panelists were asked to rate each cigarette on ten smoking attribute statements. The scores represent a range of 1 to 7, in which 4.0 is the mean. The lower the score the greater the agreement with the statement; and the higher the score the greater the disagreement with the statement. Also, the panelists were asked for overall preference and to compare each product to their usual brand. The smokers were broken down into four groups:  Reynolds Smokers 35 & over Competitive Smokers 35 & over Reynolds Smokers under 35 Competitive Smokers under 35  Results     See attachment.

MESSENGER “Madisonville, Ky. - | ‘Decémber 27, "1962         +  Of Family | Farm  pee Tobacco may be providing a “last strong “""v" hold for the traditional “family farm” in the United States—an institution which THE MESSENGER hopes ‘will never disappear. ~ *. Stephen E. Wrather, director of the tobac-_ co division of the U.S. Department of Agri- ‘> eulture’s marketing service, made the point ~ the other day that while other types. of farms — ‘are disappearing at a rapid rate, uprooting . “families they once supported, tobacco farms: “Rave actually increased in number. This may oe surprise some, but here are the figures:  “8 Nearly 9,000, 000 farms have disap- oa - peared since 1919, about 45 per cent of ‘. the total. In 1919 there were 6,500, 000 US. farms. Last year there were only 3,800, 000. none , “4. Tobacco farms meanwhile have reg: < "istered a gain of 21,000 in number since  - 1919—from 496, 000 that year to Slt  @ 000 now. TO “The decline in: “farms, Director ‘Wrather - . pointed out in his piece in TOBACCO NEWS, ’ has been steady except for a slight upturn - from 1928 to 1935, when the depression ~- brought about a return to the land. After that the downturn began at a heavier pace  .,. than ever as farmers moved to cities for  "-.<: jobs in business and industry. . _ Nearly all types of farms have been af-  -" fected. Here are a few examples of the de- | . clines among farms. for the major cash crops,  Le from 1919 to 1959:  Corn. farms dropped in number from 4,900,000 to 1,900,000. - . Wheat farms declined from 2,200,-  000 to 931,000. Cotton farms are down from 1,900,-  000 to 499,540. '. Sugar beet farms dropped from. 47,- 0006 to 23,700. . Among the major cash crops, only soybean and. tobacco farms have shown                  an increase.  @ We are glad the USDA man mentioned soybeans, which have come to be.a most im-  portant crop in our own county and ‘section.  The rise in soybean farms came with dis- covery of new product uses for the beans, —  such as soybean. oils for food: products and  : Paints.

Mr. Wrather allowed that ‘the movement away from the farm to the | ‘city results largely from changes in farm — technology and “better employment oppor-     .. and flock into the Big Town for job oppor-  980 to 1958, as has been reported many: “times. since, and commonly it is said that  ‘’. mechanization, better seed and fertilizer and ~ “the drop in manpower needed in farming.  ; “dustry has required more manpower in years  7 chines, and if the signs do not deceive every- body, the role of the modern miracle machine  --< vesting. the situation is different from wheat,  “ does most of the work.

Still, while: personal attention is still the byword for the tobacco farmer, improved methods and equipment have enabled him to get bigger crop yields and a higher cash re- turn per acre.  The TOBACCO NEWS piece pointed out that the number of farm families who depend ‘on tobacco. runs a. good deal higher than the actual number of. tobacco farms, since medi- um-size and larger acreage allotments con- tribute !o the support of two, three or more tenant families. All in all, the piece asserts, the historical: place of tobacco in American agriculture is. expected to remain stable, which is a hope which a lot of Hopkins coun- tians will share, for tobacco is still an im- portant crop in our farm economy: __label__News

® Cigarette additive reduces risks  of smoking, firm says  ip /By JUDITH EGERTON (a ‘arma Writer:       ) A new Louisville firm said yesterday that  it has produced a cigarette additive that re-”  duces the health risks of smoking.  That announcement, however, didn’t re- ceive ao enthusiastic response from tobacco companies or health officials.  L. Douglas Keeney, president and chief executive officer of C.A. Blockers Inc, in Meidinger Tower, said yesterday that the firm has successfully produced standard- sized cigarettes containing an additive that  _ Heutralizes the effect of nltrosamines, which ate carcinogens associated with lung can- cer.  The product, to be called N-BLOCTIN, could be available to tobacco companies this year, Keeney said. But first, tests will be done on people who smoke the cigarettes with the implanted additive. In a six-month test period, bronchial biopsies and ceil counts will be done on the smokers, he sald, to determine the product's effectiveness,  Keeney Sald in tests involving laboratary mice, N-BLOCTIN had proved to be “highly  “effective” In blocking the accumulation of nitrosamines in the lungs.  The lab work was spearheaded by Dr. William Waddell, a toxdology specialist and chairman of the University of Loulsville De- partment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, who for years has been researching toxie effects of tobacco and searching for a com- pound to prevent the accumulation of car- cinogens, according {o Arthur Keeney. Keeney ls a former dean of the UofL     School of Medicine, the father of L. Douglas Keeney and a company shareholder.  The additive, developed by Waddell, is composed of a high molecular weight alco- bol. The test cigarettes with the additive were developed al the University of Ken- tucky, Arthur Keeney sald,  “Nitrosamines are the most abundant car- cinogens In tobacco smoke and are believed to be a significant factor in smoking-associ- ated cancer of the lung. We belleve thar N- BLOCTIN will significantly reduce the ongo ing risk of ing cancer among cigarette  smokers,” be said.  Olhers aren’t so sure.  “With 4,000 chemicals having been identi- fied in cigarettes ... you aren't going to eliminate the health risks of cigarette smok- jog,” said Dr. Ron Davis, with the US. Of-  fice of Smoking and Health. But, he said,  you could lower the health risk by blocking -  the nitresamtnes.  Dietrich Hoffman, a toxicologist with the noo-profit American Health Foundation In New York, said “the concept Is good,” but he would have to see the data to know If the  development is a true breakthrough. Tobac-. ,  co analyst John Maxwell Jr. doesa't think the CA. Blockers announcement yesterday ts Significant for the tobacco industry, It has Dever been ‘proven that tobacco products contain carcinogenic substances, he said, The additive “Isn't gatag to get very far wun the tobacco industry because they feel there isn’t anything to block,” he said.  A spokeswoman for R.J, Reyna olds Tobacco Co. sald more work needs to be done before scientists  _ Can evaluate the additive,  Keeney said the additive would not be subject to approval from the federal Food and Drug Administra-  ‘tion because it's a cigarettereiated  product and the FDA doesn't regu- late clgaretes.  . Keeney, 36, worked In markeUng at Brown & Williamson for about three years. He and seven ‘other shareholders formed CA. Blockers legs than two year ago after they acquired the patent and research work for the technology that neu- trallzes nltrosamines from Waddell and Carolyo Marlowe, a medical school research associate married to Waddell. .  The company, which has no tles to any tobacco company, went pub- lic in October, Keeney sald. Yester- day, the stock closed unchanged at  624 cents a share jn overthe-count- er trading.  sv9z691LL0e  The Couri Journal fa . @f “21-88 (5) a  {| Pa 24     (©) OG1424 __label__News

Am. Farm Bureau Holds 77th. Annual Convention  BOYDTON — The 77th annual Convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation was held at the Convention Center in Reno, Nevada, the week of January 7-il, 1996,  The activities began on Sunday when the Women’s and Young Farmer’s Programs were held.  The American Farm, Bureau  ‘Women announced that, through volunteer fund raising, the women had raised thirty thousand dollars in private funds to help build and make operational a fruit and vegetable canzing facility in the Western Ukraine. The check was presented during the meeting to the Citizens of Network for Foreign Affairs, The campaign was launched in Oc- tober 1994 and after ten Farm Bureau women spent three weeks in the Ukraine with the .C.N.F.A. Agribusiness Volunteer Program, . Money was donated by farm families across the U. S. and the project helped to reflect this year’s meeting | theme ‘‘Grasstoots to Global’’,  | In the “Young Farmer meeting, “the “discussion meet was held. yk oung frmers from many states  t “crigagaid i in ten rounds of discussions on previously assigned topics in an elimination process. The winner was Casey Niemann of Kansas and his prize was a new Dodge pickup truck. The A.F.B.F. Achievement Award went to Mike DeSutter of Il- linois. He was also the winner of a new Dodge pickup.  At the opening session, A.F.B.F. President Dean Kleckner gave an interesting and informative address, speaking to the 5,700-+ farmers and ranchers in attendance. :  ‘Kleckner serves on the National commission of Economic growth and,Tax reform which is chaired by  Jack Kemp. His question. was, “How Big Government and at what cost?’” His philosophy is: cut the  budget, stop spending, no new.  taxes, and spend within it’s means like all businesses and home owners must do. We need leaders with an understanding of budgeting.  Farm programs have been ‘“‘over- whelmed’* by the National Budget Debate, but Farm Bureau is calling for adequate financial support for agricultural research and market development programs. These pro- grams are agriculture’s future. Dollars: spent in these areas are returned many times over.  Last year the United States sold approximately $53- billion of agricultural goods to foreign buyers and ‘it is expected that this year’s sales will reach $58 billion, Farm Bureau will continue to work to ex- pand trade throughout. the world.  Kieckner also pledged that Farm Bureau will continue to seek proper- ty rights protection and. common sense reform of environmental regulations and the Endangered Species Act.  Kleckner stressed that. ‘cutting the capital gains tax rate, raising the Estate Tax exemption level, in- creasing the deductions of self employed health insurance, and providing enhanced depreciation schedules must remain tied to farm program approval as these measures will affect farmers in a positive manner,  The farmers and ranchers atten- ding the convention also heard talks by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, who is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Ed Madigan, Secretary of Ariculture, spoke to all county  presidents: in attendance at a lun- cheon on Monday.  Speed skater Bonnie Blair ad- ~  dressed the group on Tuesday..In .  her speech, she stressed ‘‘Set ‘ goals and be dedicated, have a balance in your life, and don’t be afriad to take tisks: These. three things apply to life no matter if you are a farmer, a speed skater or any: other profes sion in Which you are engaged."’ There were. conferences and workshops on many topics during the week, Some of these topics in- cluded Risk Management; Precision Farming, , Property Rights, Tax Reform, Dairy, Beef Cattle,  .

FSC-502-C  December 13, 1994 TO ALL FIELD SALES PERSONNEL SUBJECT: Petition Against Tobacco Regulation  In October, we sent you petition packs to combat a very serious threat by the anti-tobacco forces to encourage the food and drug administration (FDA) to place severe regulations on  cigarettes. The petitions were to be placed at selected retail locations.  Thus far, the responses have been minimal and we encourage you to follow-up with retailers to retum completed petitions as soon as possible. The deadline for petition returns has been  extended to December 31, 1994.     The threat against our industry is very real. The power shift in Congress in no way diminishes this threat. Our goal is to demonstrate, by the petitions we receive, that smokers and the general public are against any further regulations on tobacco.

Anion-Exchange Chromatography to Determine the Concentration of Chloride in Sweat for Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis Marvin E. Miller, Janice M. Cosgriff, and Robert H. Schwartz  For the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, we use the “Macroduct Sweat Collection System” (Wescor) to sample sweat, and anion-exchange chromatography to determine its chloride content. The chromatographic system consists of a What- man Partisil SAX 10-m coiumn, an isocratic phosphate- buffered mobile phase, and ultraviolet detection at 200 nm. The sweat chloride concentrations of 10 individuals with cystic fibrosis ranged from 101 to 131 mmol/L (mean 111, SD 9 mmol/L). For 11 controls the values ranged from 13 to 54 mmol/L (mean 28, SD 11 mmol/L). We conclude that the procedure is reliable for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.  Additional Keyphrases: reference interval (disease and normal) : pilocarpine iontophoresis - Macroduct Sweat Collection Sys- tem + vapor pressure osmometry compared  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is usually suspected on clinical grounds, and the diagnosis is confirmed by finding an above- normal electrolyte concentration in sweat, as reflected by chloride, sodium, or osmolality. Various analytical tech- niques for these sweat determinations include chloridome- tric titration (2), chloride-selective electrodes (2), electrical conductivity (3), and most recently, osmometry (¢, 5). We used a commercial sweat-collection system to obtain our sweat samples, and we have developed a liquid-chromato- graphic procedure for determining the concentration of chloride in sweat.  Materials and Methods  Apparatus. For chromatographic analyses we used a Varian 5020B liquid-chromatographic system equipped with a UV-100 detector that was interfaced with a Varian 4270 integrator (all from Varian Associates, Instrument Division, Palo Alto, CA 94303), and a 250 x 4.6 mm (i.d.) Partisil-10 SAX column (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ 07014), operated at 22°C. The mobile phase was KH,PO, (10 mmol/L, pH 4.6). The flow rate was 2.0 mL/min from 0 to § min, then 0.7 mL/min until the chloride peak was complete- ly eluted, at about 10 min. The pressure was 10 133 kPa (100 atm) at 2.0 mL/min, then 4053 kPa (40 atm) at 0.7 mL/min. The wavelength for detection was 200 nm.

Received May 3, 1985; accepted June 25, 1985.  injected 5 yL of sweat for each sample. The concentration of chloride in sweat was determined by the area under the chloride peak, as compared with those of known chloride standards, for which absorbance at 200 nm was linearly related to physiological concentrations of chloride in sweat (0-150 mmol/L).  For comparison, we determined sweat osmolality with a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT 84321), a method shown to be reliable in the diagnosis of CF (4, 5).  Reagents. We used reagent-grade monobasic potassium phosphate and doubly distilled de-ionized water to prepare the mobile phase, which was then filtered and de-gassed. Standard chloride solutions were prepared with doubly distilled de-ionized water and reagent-grade sodium chlo- ride.  Procedures. We sampled sweat from 10 individuals with CF and from 11 normal controls, using the “Macroduct Sweat Collection System” (Wescor) (4), This system uses pilocarpine iontophoresis followed by sweat collection in a “Macroduct’—a disposable, half-dollar size, plastic device that fits snugly over the iontophoresed skin and is secured by Velcro straps. The sweat flows into a small hole at the center of the “Macroduct” and into a microbore spiral plastic tube. The intact sweat is then directly injected into the chromatographic system.  Resulis and Discussion  The sweat. chloride concentrations and sweat osmolalities of the CF individuals and controls are shown in Table 1. In patients with CF the concentrations of chloride in sweat were 101 mmol/L or more, whereas controls had values 54 mmol/L or less. These results were consistent with the known phenotypes of the controls and the CF patients. In addition, there was complete agreement of the sweat chlo- ride concentrations with the sweat osmolality determina- tions.  This anion-exchange chromatographic method for diagno- sis of CF is simple, rapid, and inexpensive. The procedure is made possible by the ease and reliable procurement of sweat with the Macroduct Sweat Collection System, a system that potentially can be used in connection with a variety of analytical techniques.  This sweat collection system overcomes many of the problems of previous approaches (6). Its advantages include: no condensate error, an easily visible sample, complete recovery of sweat (ie., there is almost no dead space),  CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 31, No. 10,1985 1715 __label__Scientific
An Art Director's Viewpoint     Advertising Age, December 23,. 1968  How to Get a Woman's Attention:  By. Stephen Baker  The man-woman situations depicted in the Silva Thins commercials are selling cigarets by. the millions.  In| case you haven’t watched television: lately, these are the commercials which  have slight maso- chistic overtones. There is this long bony character who wears no smile and dark glasses; who seems to be very. preoccupied,. as: it in a daze; who loves his ‘Impossible Cig- arets” so much that he prefers them to even the most beau- tiful girls.  He likes cigarets and hates: women so much, in fact, that he forsakes the latter on deserted highways, ocean liners, cable cars, mountain tops, penthouse apartments and anywhere else if the girls as much as dare: to touch his cigarets. He is the epito- me:of the modern male-on-the-prowl who picks his. women: the way you’d pick. your hors d'oeuvre off a smorgasbord table; they are merely to satisfy his momentary appetite. He is obnoxious, arrogant and quite possibly incurably selfish, but he executes his rude antics with admirable eloquence.  This infuriating oaf may yet.go down in marketing history as one of the most bril- liant. creations of advertising pundits. Ob- viously,. viewers of either sex—and partic- ularly. the young—enjoy vicariously the adventures of the Silva Thins man.  Women (an important market for this cigaret): especially dig the scene of “The Impossible Cigaret.” Psychologically, they seem to fee] right.at home: with the situa- tions. They quite willingly put themselves in the place of the suffering heroine.  Puts Women Where They Want to Be  The makers: of this campaign demon- strate a shrewd insight into the emotional make-up of today’s woman.. Using what appears: to be a masculine approach: in their advertising, they: are reaching the very core of: their feminine audience. The hero. in the Silva Thins commercials ap- pears. to be just what the doctor ordered. His: strength lies in his aloofness. Ignoring practically every rule of etiquette, he summarily puts his girlfriend'in her place,.     Stephen Baker  (4)  and exactly where so many women would unconsciously like to:be:  The Silva Thins commercials, bold as they may be in their approach, are an open proclamation to the American pub- lic that it’s: still the male who rules the roost, or should be. Here the: woman is presented with a boyfriend figure who dominates instead of being dominated. While he makes no attempt. to make out with: her—in fact if anything he takes the opposite tack—he establishes a rela- tionship that pleases her feminine instinct.  It will be interesting to watch the sales of Silva Thins continue to climb. The fact that concurrently another cigaret, Virginia Slims, is trying to: reach the female mar- ket. with its “For-Women-Only” cigaret makes things even livelier. Our guess. is that the appeal of Virginia Slims—which claims that its cigaret' is made for women to permit them to assert. their independ- ence at last—will not be as. successful: as that of “The Impossible Cigaret.”  It's easy to change cigarets. It’s not so easy to change the fundamental! psychol- ogy of women, #     Ignore Her  Silva Thins character may go down in marketing history, says Steve Baker.     1002403141 __label__News

STATUS  Denitration : The isolated yeast strains. Nos. 1011, 1014 and 1018 were re-tested for growth: and denitration in tobacco extract and in. yeast extract / peptone / dextrose broth. The growth rates in tobacco extract were between 0.45 and 0.6 hr and in yeast extract between 0.65 and 0.8 hr -, .  Strain 1011 was used for a. growth and denitration trial. in  the: fermentor. The trial. was not successful. A reason may be that on the contrary to the shaken flask trials, the PH was controlled. Agitation and aeration were also very. ditferent. The: trial will. be repeated.  Identification : Identification of the isolatedi yeasts was terminated. finally, 11 strains. out of the 25 were found to be identical.     Bacteria : A minimal (salt) medium, supplied with nitrate or nitrite as a mitrogen source and ethanol as a carbon source, was used to isolate denitrating and. denitrifying bacteria both aerobically and anaerobically. Different strains were: isolated and are currently being; tested to determine their characteristics (2).  Plans : - Repeat the denitration trial in the fermentor using strains 1011, 1014 and ioue?. - Test Lsolated bacteria for denitration. / denitrification. - Isolate bacteria at higher temperatures. - Continue efforts for the identification of bacteria.

‘ March 5, 1991  MEMORANDUM  MAR 11 1991  TO: Dr. James F. Glenn CC: HCM RFG  FROM: Hilda and Leonard Zahn  SUBJECT: International Conference on Indoor Air Quality and Climate, Toronto, Canada, July 29-Aug 3, 1991  A speaker at the opening session said that in seeking to con- serve energy in recent years, “we have created a monster." The monster has several faces: medical problems, building problems (which have expanded beyond the "sick building syndrome" of com- mercial buildings to include residential homes and even apart- ments), and social, economic and political problems.  Other aspects are involved as well. Research into indoor air quality (IAQ) has grown at a tremendous rate since the first in- ternational meeting on the subject was held in 1978. Until re- cently, scientific attention had been focused chiefly on outdoor air quality;-.now, however, there is a new science -- indoor air chemistry -- with more funds and more investigators, especially in the industrialized nations. There also is a surprising amount of work going on in less-developed countries, much of it in col- laboration with western researchers.  There is more concern about IAQ because most people spend about 80-90% of their time indoors during their lives, and tight- ened structures generate and retain more harmful or potentially harmful organisms, agents, gases, odors, and particulates. The list contains hundreds of items, some of them produced naturally by the human organism.  The overall situation is compounded by the fact that the com- plex actions of- many indoor substances as well as the interac- tions between them are presently little understood. The immense amount of variability of human reactions to agents indoor adds to the complexity of trying to determine what factor (s) may create a risk and who is at risk upon exposure.  Scientists are not always helpful with data that often seem to be a bit far out. For example, taking a shower subjects everyone to inhalation or dermal absorption of a number of volatile organ- ic compounds (VOC) in the water. Many of these chemicals have been shown to be harmful to health.  It seems valid to say that people in the developed countries generally are not adversely affected by all the putatively harm- ful substances they encounter every day while they are indoors.  It is equally valid to say that nobody really can say what are @  the long-term effects of many of the things floating in the in- oS  door air. oO  °  °  a  eonard PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL ° ahn  and Associates, Inc. 13 LINCOLN ROAD «P.O.

° July 26, 1968  Dr. Murray Senkus  SUTTON SMOKING MATERIAL  In August 1967, personnel from the Sutton Research Corporation, Santa Monica, California displayed four sets of cigarettes to COMPANY personnel. One of these sets (70-mm. filler rod, no filter-tip) contained a non- tobacco filler, the socalled Sutton material. The other three sets (70-mm. filler rod plus 20-am. Estron filter tip) contained 1:3 tobacco blend:Sutton material, 3:1 tobacco blend:Sutton material, and the tobacco  blend alone. - A Sutton material cigarette on smoking burned much like a tobacco  cigarette, gave an ash which behaved and looked much Tike tobacco cigarette ash, and produced smoke which had a very bland taste. This bland taste  persisted even when the cigarette was smoked to a relatively short tutt length. Analysis of the Sutton material cigarette smoke indicated that it was as low as or lower than tobacco smoke in respect of the concentrations of those components considered harmful to the smoker by some authorittes. The components of interest include nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanide, acetalde- hyde, acetone, acrolein, phenol, carbcn monoxide, and certain polycyclic - hydrocarbons. ‘“espite the fact that these analytical date were derived from .  a number of cigarettes much smaller than usual, the results were encouraging.

‘ We sermemarte oe  TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT:     THE COMBINED ROLE OF TOBACCO SMOKE CONDENSATES, AVITAMINOSTS AND ALCOHOL IN THE ETIOLOGY OF ORAL CANCER  INTRODUCTION :     During the past twelve years IT, as well as many of my colleagues, have observed that a large percentage of patients afflicted with oral cancer illicited histories of excessive tobacco smoking, concomitant abuse of alcoholic beverages and diets deficient in essential protein and vitamins. It is theoretically possible that the dietary deficiency cowld condition the oral tissues or be a predisposing factor en- abling the carcinogen present in the tobacco condensate to induce the development of a cancerous process. The role of alcohol may be that of a synergistic direct irritant, or indirectly by its action on the liver to effect degenerative changes leading to cirrhosis; thus impairing an important immune center of the body.  Experimently, it is the purpose of this project to induce in laboratory animals  (white mice) cancer of the oral tissues by combining the factors, tobacco condensates,  alcohol, and dietary deficiencies.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE :     Six groups of white mice, each group to consist of ten mice will be subjected to variations of tobacco application, alcohol and diet. A control group will be in- cluded. The tobacco condensate will be diluted in 50% acetone and will be painted  on the oral mucosa four times weekly. The alcohol will be placed in the drinking water of the animals and changed completely four times weekly. A 10% solution of a standard brand of whiskey will be used. The diets, when deficient, will be re~ stricted in Vit. "A", "B" complex and "OC".  ANTMAL GROUPS:     Group I The oral mucosa will be painted on the same gite with the tobacco condensate.

1-5-6/Ambient smoke  Thurs., Aug. 11, 1977-S.F.Examiner-Page 37  Other voices /in orice ree Second-hand smoke —is it harmful?  By Charies H. Hine, M.D.  S A MEDICAL SCIENTIST involved tn research, I ve been asked more and more often of late to comment on legislation now pending in the California Legislature to prohibit or restrict smoking in all places of employment and most places to which the public has accem.  Rather than enter the political arena, | confine my remarks to facts established by competent research and in which qualified medical experts — tocluding those who often represent anti-smoking organizations — concur.  Senate Bil} 500. now under consideration by our Legislature, begins with these words:  “The Legislature finds and declares that tobacco smoke and smoke from other plants is harmful to the health, comfort and environment of non-smokers...”  The Legislature can no doubt find that tobacco amoke is disturbing to the comfort and desired environment of nonsmokers, but to declare it harmful to the health of non-smokers contradicts medical facts.  A pon-smoker cannot contract cancer or other diseases from second-hand smoke..  Before further addressing the question of disease, ft ts necessary to dispel several misconceptions about sidestream tobacco smoke.  Firstly, because it is diluted by the environment, it is not “more toxic” than the smoke inhaled by the smoker.  In addition, any ‘attempt to measure ambient tobacco smoke must take into account complex variables such as smoke concentration, room volume, ventilation.  Another misconception is that'the exposure of a gsone«moker can be measured in terms of a specific sumber of cigarettes. Although misleading, the concept of using 2 given number of cigarettes is understandable, especially for lay persons and non- thedical journalists.  However, such an extrapolation involves highly unreliable estimates and is usually based upon dnfealistic experiments.  _ Apart from a discussion of disease, there probably are physical irritations involved with exposure to high concentrations of tobacco smoke.  This may be caused by constituents of tobacco smpoke like ammonia, acrojein and aldehydes, especially When they are coupied with warm, dry air.  It fs not inconceivable that the odor and high visibility of tobacco smoke play a part in the annoyance feaction of some non-smokers to tobacco smoke.  _ Unfortunately, definite evidence available that such ts the case dees not exist. While (bere have been some experiments, which create simulated exposures, these studies employ experimental conditions which are not typical of those in real life.  The medical literature to date does not indicate any significant heaith risk to the non-smoker {rom environmental tobacco smoke normally encountered in Gay-to-day situations.  It ts of interestito exarnine the observations of scientists who have generally expressed anti-tobacco sentiments.  For example, Dr. E. Cuyler Hammon, vice president, Epidemiology and Statistical Research, of the American Cancer Society, addressed the International Conference on Public Education About Cancer in Monaco tn 1974.  A delegate asked Dr. Hammor his views on the hazards of tobacco smoke on non-smokers who inhale it. The official summary proceedings of the conference  reports  “Dr. Hammon stated that there was ‘no shred of evidence that a non-smoker can get cancer from ‘second-hand’ smoke and there is a lot of evidence that be cannot... He added that'to suggest passive smoking (inhalation of smoke by non-smokers) could cause cancer is dishonest, and that he would be prepared to testify as much in court.”  Dr. Johnathan Rboades, chairman of the National Cancer Advisory Board and a past-president of the  American Cancer Society, ts another prestigious spokesman for the anti-smoking movement. He declared:  “I do not have bard evidence in that direction (that: there is 2 harmful effect from smoke on the non- smoker). To my knowledge, it is not, in fact, actually barmful”  The “Journal of Preventive Medicine” reported to its professional readership:.  “It appears that passive inhalation of (second-hand) tobacca smoke by non-smokers or smokers does not increase \heir risk for chronic illnesses such as cancer. of the respiratory tract, emphysema or cardiovascular  Dr. Ernest Wydner, of. the American Health Foundation; is one of. the major scientific voices of the antismoking movement. He sums it up this way:  _“Passive smoking can provide tears or can be peoerwise disagreeable, but it has no influence on the ealth.”  California's legislators face a potitical decision concerning what some non-smokers find disagreeable or annoying.  To proclaim such a law necessary to protect the health of non-smokers is a premise contradicted by scientific evidence. The opinion of researchers does not provide a sound scientific basis upon which the proposed law may rest.  Dr. Charles H.

CBB-82778  -PROJECT NUMBER: 1806  PROJECT TITLE: New Tobacco Processes SECTION LEADER: S..R.. Wagoner  PERIOD COVERED: June, 1988  I. GT_ART - SUPPORT  A. Objective: To provide processes for converting and_casing stem ' materials for the Bermuda Hundred Pilot Plant.  B. Results: Batches of Louisville cut rolled stems (CRS) .were cased with either monopotassium citrate or citric acid and shipped to the Bermuda Hundred Pilot Plant.  The D Pilot Plant CRS line was utilized to produce CRS at 150, 90 and 53 cuts per inch for trials at the BHPP. These trials showed: that all three cpi values produced the same pressure: drop vs velocity profile for the absorber. This profile was also different. from the Louisville CRS, as the Pilot Plant materials  produced less pressure drop at a given velocity.. The reasons for these results are being investigated.  C. Plans: Continue to produce stem products as required by Project ART  Transfer the Hauni WD. tunnel from the Louisville Stem Processing Facility to D Pilot Plant, providing the capability of superheating stems with equipment that has. produced IS of acceptable quality in production...  II.. PROJECT ART - COMMERCIAL. PROCESS DEVELOPMENT  A. Qbjective: To conduct trials providing information for development of the ART commercial process.  ‘B. Results: Post-ART filler was processed through the VT separator in MC Core 1 to provide clumps for steam treatment. (This ART run was performed at nonstandard conditions to produce filler containing a high percentage of compacted clumps.) The VT provided a good separation at a maximum feed rate of ~2000'1 ‘hr. _The run yielded 43% heavies (161 1b) containing 87% clumps The heavy fraction was then processed through the burley spray  ' cylinder in the Semiworks at 500 lb/hr. Residence. time was 1.5 minutes, and steam was applied at the entrance and exit. The. exit filler contained 20% clumps of reduced size. Moisture analysis of the input and exit materials showed the OV. value to increase from 25.5% to 26.4% across the steam cylinder. This VI separator was 24" wide, therefore a larger 36" unit would’ process ~3000 lb/hr. Thus, if this. approach was used for the commercial facility, the designed flow rate (5700 lb/hr) would require two VI separators.  tnirideOiieesea wie were produced containing post-ART CRS __label__Scientific
4 SU: DRS. GILL, PIERCE. MCALLISTER, OTR, o7>  Spring 1997 - App. #4721 - William A. Pryor, Ph.D. - Louisiana State Reviewer (Primary): McAllister Cigarette Smoke, Beta-Carotene, Alcohol and Cancer  BACKGROUND and PLAN: Pryor is a “living legend" in the world of reactive oxidant species, particularly those involving free radicals and/or cigarette smoke. For many years, he has been a proponent of the theory that some low molecular weight water soluble quinone system radicals in cigarette smoke are responsible for DNA damage, specifically production of single strand breaks. Since his tar extract system produces superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, the mechanism, along with the identity of the radical remains obscure.  Now comes the famous (or infamous) CARET trial (beta-carotene and retinol efficiency trial) and the ATBC (alpha-tocopherol-beta-carotene for cancer prevention) study in which it was revealed that smokers had suffered higher rates of lung cancer with beta-carotene supplementation. This was confounded by the finding that in fact alcohol intake more clearly correlated with cancer incidence. It has been suggested by some that at high circulating levels of beta-carotene in the CARET study, cigarette smoke might actually be interacting with that molecule to generate oxidizing tumor promoters. Pryor believes he is in a unique position to help unravel this birdsnest of interacting variables. He proposes five lines of inquiry:  1. Does the aforementioned radical actually cause single strand breaks in DNA? In fact he has already shown that it does albeit at a tremendously high level of the tar extract.  2. Does his quinone model compound bind to DNA? His model system for these studies is an aged catechol solution which he has now prepared with carbon-14, He will ascertain its DNA binding ability.  3. Does BaP bind to DNA in the presence of tar extract but not microsomes? Does BaP bind to DNA in the presence of microsomes with or without tar extract? Does the binding differ if normal or ethanol-induced microsomes are used? When binding occurs, what are the effects of beta-carotene and alpha tocopherol? He has in fact already demonstrated BaP binding, but it is in the presence of cigarette tar levels of up to 50:1 weight to weight excess over the DNA target.  Can this be meaningful in any physiological sense?  4. Do the micronutrients beta-carotene or alpha-tocopherol bind to DNA in the presence of microsomes and/or cigarette tar extract? Does the presence of BaP influence the binding of these micronutrients to DNA? With this series of experments, he hopes to test the hypothesis that carotenes may react with the radicals and/or oxidants to form species that can add to DNA to give an adduct that will then affect the subsequent binding of BaP. This is another kitchen sink series of experiments that could take tremendous amounts of time and when the results are extrapolated back to in vivo ranges, might or might not have something to do with reality.  5. Do BaP DNA-adducts form in rat hepatocytes exposed to ACT? Are there differences in BaP DNA/DNA adducts between normal and ethinol-dependent rat hepatocytes? What is the effect of beta-carotene or alpha-tecopherol? This is actually one of the more interesting questions that he wants to address and may in fact relate directly to the ethanol finding in the ATBC study.

The malority believe that smoke flows freely from smoking to non-smoking ereas, and 100 percent amoke- fre |s the only way to protect both employees in the workplace and the public at large, The minority group would rather allow businesses to set thelr own policles and avold mandating policy altogether,  The primary difference of opinion centers around protecting the rights of business owners to 86t policy versus protecting the nonsmoking publle. The minority position of the commtittes belleve that since thera Is no threshold established for the amount of second-hand smoke that is hazardous, wa do not have sufficient basis to establish a 100 percent smoke-free poiley. They feel that each business owner should be allowed to set thelt own smoking policy. The majority believe that & threshold is net necessary. Second-hand amoke has been proven to be harmful to nonsmokers. In our survey to business owners in E! Dorado County, 83 percent belleve that second-hand smeke is hazardous to nonsmokers’ health.  Another area of disagreement ts in the treatment of employees, Many members belleve that all businseses should be treated the same. Allowing smoking sections in restaurants will expose employees to second-hand smoke, but the ordinance requires all other businesses to provide smoke-free alr for employees. Please refer to the attached letter from Betty Turner, Policy Director of the American Lung Asscciation for further explanation.  TCAL0447628 __label__Letter

INDUSTRY YOUTH INITIATIVES  BACKGROUND  The tobacco industry has long taken a number of affirmative steps in response to concerns about youth smoking. However, the youth smoking issue continues to drive legislative issues and media coverage -- and the levels of anti-smoking charges against the industry on this issue are increasing.  OBJECTIVE  To demonstrate to the public, legislators and decision-makers, that the tobacco industry has and continues to support its longstanding commitment that its preducts are not for young people.  To reaffirm and broaden this commitment, a five-pronged effort has been developed to counter youth smoking. The program includes model state legislation for minimun age requirements; model legislation for vending machine sales; a new youth industry code; a retail sales initiative; and a new, tobacco-specific booklet, to expand the industry's popular Responsible Living Program.  THE INITIATIViis  1. Retail Avareness Program  The tobacco industry will work with the retailers who sell tobacco products to reinforce adherence to both state laws and our own conviction that smoking is for those adults who choose tc smoke. The program is designed to assist the retailing industry, and to enlist their support and cooperation, in observing prohibitions against the sale of tobacco rroducts to persons who are below the legal minimum  Distribution will be through the membership of the co- sponsoring organizations. The program will also be advertised in state and national retail trade publications. The Tobacco Institute will provide promotional kits in numbers requested by the sponsoring organizations. Decals and other materials, noting the sponsoring organizations, will be provided at no cost to the co-sponsoring organization.

This agreement, which will require Congressional legislation for implementation, calls for disbanding and dissolving The Council for Tobacco Research within 90 days after such legislation goes into effect. Anticipating that such legislation may be enacted, we have decided that it will not be prudent for us to fund further grant applications.      Accordingly, we have suspended review of all new and competing renewal grant applications. However, we intend to meet the obligations we have to current grantees. In short, those of you who have an active grant with CTR can expect that our obligation to you will be met, but no new grant applications or competing renewals will be considered,  I deeply regret this decision. I believe that the vicious attack on CTR by the Attorneys General reflected a profound misunderstanding of the mission of CTR in supporting the biomedical research community. It is unfortunate that this action will deprive the scicntific community of $20 million dollars annually that might well be spent on important scientific research. This ill-considered demand by the Attorneys General will penalize the biomedical  rescarch community and the public at large. You have the collective good wishes of the staff of The Council for Tobacco Research and our sponsors.                                           Respectfully,  vf James F.

a) . ple yy  RJR Interoffice Memorandum  SUBJECT: R&D Perspective on DATE: November 19, 1987 Blind Product Test  TO: W. M. Hildebolt FROM: M. F. Dube  The results of a blind product test of fresh aftertaste (FAT) products were reported on 11/5/87. The management summary provided by MDD is included as an attachment. The products utilized the recently developed controlled release pellet technology with a low level of menthol. These products had measured smoke menthol deliveries of less than 6.5 ug/puff as compared to approx. 70 ug/puff for Salem Lt. and approx. 45 ug/puff for Newport. Three low menthol level products were tested, in which pellets containing 3%, 5% and 7% menthol by weight were inserted in the filter. No menthol was added via conventional means (i.e. top dressing, filter flavor). Products were tested among 18 - 49 year old non-menthol Full Flavor and Full Flavor Low Tar smokers, male and female.  In the FF category, all three products were rated inferior on %70+ acceptance. All three products increased menthol, minty and artificial taste attributes. As we've seen repeatedly in qualitative work, FF non-menthol smokers will not accept a product if they can detect menthol. Further corroboration is provided by an earlier 1987 Concept/Product Test in which non-menthol smokers were given a concept, stating that "a hint of menthol" was used in the products. These products were overwhelmingly rejected.  In the FFLT category, the 5% menthol product was rated parity among total category and superior among 18 - 24 year old smokers and among smokers with a high fresh aftertaste ideal. The 3% and 7% menthol products were rated inferior to the Control among FFLT products with the 3% level apparently too low and the 7% level too high. For the 5% product, tobacco taste, strength and harshness attributes were maintained while fresh aftertaste and cooling aftertaste were increased. Increases in mildness, menthol, minty and artificial taste were also noticed; however, this category did not view these attributes negatively as evidenced by the positive acceptance scores.  These test results are highly encouraging in view of the fact that the suspected target category for a new product with fresh aftertaste is FFLT, young adult female smokers. Additionally, the 5% menthol pellet product was parity among category indicating that its performance was comparable to existing brands. However, it did have the aftertaste improvement vehicle which should enhance acceptance in the FFLT category. We expect to have a product with this technology on the market within the next 12 months.  n ® Qo oO N an 00 Ka S __label__Letter

aa  t  .  RJR R&D Statistical Support  InterOffice Memorandum  SUBJECT: Visible Sidestream Smoke Measurement DATE: January 24, 1985  TO: Joe Inman FROM: Michael J. Morton  Brand R&D  INTRODUCTION  Sidestream smoke measurements were taken on 52 products: 11 prototype products, 16 ultra low tar products, and 25 top brands. The measurements were made by Becky Dunn and John Aldridge. The sidestream smoke measures reported were visible absorbance values. Each number reported is the  average of 3 readings. Two different devices were used to make the sidestream smoke measures. Forty-five products were measured on one device  and the remaining 7 were measured on the other. Some products, a monitor product and NOW 85, were smoked on both machines to assess differences in  the two devices, and to monitor the machines’ performance.  The primary goal of the study was to determine which of the ll prototype products give off less visible sidestream smoke than all of the 41 commer- cial products. Additionally, a comparison was made of the two measurement devices and the visible sidestream smoke values for all products in the  study were compared.  I will first deseribe the results of a comparison between the two measure- ment devices and then I will describe the comparison that was made among the 52 products.  DEVICE COMPARISON  An analysis of variance on the two measurement devices showed an average difference of about .0178 visible absorbance units between the two machines. (The newer machine read about .0178 lower than the original machine.) That difference was not quite significant at the .05 level (it yielded a p-value of .060). So there is some indication of a difference between the two machines, but it is not statistically significant at the standard level. The difference was relatively constant for both types of cigarettes that were used to monitor the machines. The difference was .0185 units for the so-called Monitor product (whieh had an average absorbance of about +75) and -0170 units for NOW 85 (which had an average absorbance of about .54).  In the next section, comparisons are made between the products, both assum- ing that the two devices are indistinguishable, and after adjusting for the estimated device difference. The conclusion about which prototypes are dis- tinguishable from the other products is not changed according to which as- sumption is made.  8£04 STé6Qag __label__Letter

PM USA has won.  In particular, last fall PM USA was successful at the Federal Circuit in arguing that the relevant claims of B&W's US Reissue Patent 32,615 re a cigarette w/ a reduced circumference were invalid, which upheld a '99 ruling to the same effect by federal district court in Louisville in a trial beginning in '89. B&W attempted to have a rehearing at the Federal Circuit and was denied. The time has now passed for B&W's last recourse, a petition to the Supreme Court, without any filing by them.  Re specifics, this clears the way for future PM USA production of Superslims for export, assuming no relevant BAT patents in the particular countries of destination. We are currently researching the issue specifically in Japan to see if there are other BAT patents in addition to the BAT Japanese patent successfully invalidated by JT with PM assistance and will report the results when available in ~3-6 weeks. Of course, our proposed global resolution to BAT in response to their offer to setile the issue in Australia would resolve this question on a worldwide basis.  Special recognition needs to be made of Jim Schardt, who handled this entire matter for many years with great skill, patience, and foresight.  We'll keep you posted.

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE Richmond, Virginia  F. G. Owen DATE: December 7, 1989  SUBJECT: EVALUATION OF KABAT SAMPLING/ANALYSIS TEST AT LPF  Objectives;  1.  Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat concentration (PPM) within a hogshead of strip.  Determine the amount of variation in the Kabat application and process systems at the Leaf Processing Facility (LPF).  Determine the average difference between Kabat (methoprene) results  generated at Universal Leaf Tobacco Company (ULT) using the GC method and results generated at PM using the HPLC method.  Conclusions:  1.  The average amount of variation in the Kabat concentration for the fifteen (15) hogsheads which were sampled during the test was 1.1 PPM. The "projected" average variation in the fourteen (14) hogsheads which were not sampled was 1.3 PPM. Based on a 95% confidence interval of the overall average variation, the Kabat concentration within an individual hogshead can vary by + 2.4 PPM around the average value.  The Kabat flow for each system was set at a rate which was calculated to achieve a projected Kabat value of 7.5 PPM at a constant rate of tobacco throughput. The variation in each Kabat system at LPF was determined on  a 95% confidence interval. The data for each of the systems is as follows:     System er# NL _x_ Projected Ae a foroaee sx_ 95% CI. 1 49 5.7 7.5 - 1.8 1.3 + 2.6 2 49 6.0 7.5 - 1.5 1.3 + 2.7 3 49 6.2 7.5 - 1.3 2.2 + 4,3  All parameters were held as steady as possible during the tests which were conducted, therefore the estimates of variation for each system are probably the best that can be achieved at this time. Under normal operating conditions, the variation would probably be greater.  0769AF  ESOSTPEZO? __label__Memo

Since there appears to be a trend toward increasing body weight in male adylts below the age of 45, this raises the question as to whether the weight gained by former amokers is attributable to smoking cessation or is an effect of aging.  Unfortunately many of the studies that have examined the relationship of smoking cessation to weight gain have foeused on cross-sectionaldata."" An analysis based on longitudinal data, the Comatock and Stone study," confounds the problem by using 8 re- stricted age range (40 to 60 years) and by not having controlled for the fact that men (undifferentiated for amoking habita) below the age of 45 years tend to gain weight as they get older.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017  TO: Gina Fawcett DATE: = April 17, 1995  FROM: ‘Patrick Piscitelli SUBJECT: Marlboro Ultra Lights Test Market  As we discussed, the following forwards for your review the background information concerning the Marlboro Ultra Lights test market along with specific trade issues.  Background  Marlboro Ultra Lights Kings and 100's were introduced into three test markets during 1989. These markets were Indianapolis, IN, and Portland, OR, on April 17, 1989, and Nashville, TN, on September 18, 1989. During 1994, the test market was expanded to include Kentucky. The  Marlboro Ultra Lights test market is now in its sixth year.  Our objective has been to restore and maintain Marlboro Ultra Lights to the four test markets and restrict further distribution outside the designated area.  Trade Issue  Marlboro Ulira Lights has been found in a number of retail stores outside the test market areas. This has been an issue for almost as long as the brand has been available. Approximately 70 of our direct customers are selling Marlboro Ultra Lights to about 4,000 retail accounts located outside the designated test market areas. The product has been found in 21 states. These are  preliminary numbers based on data received from the STARS group.  Selected wholesalers use Marlboro Ultra Lights as leverage to win over retail accounts (located outside the test market) from their competitors. This creates an unfair sales advantage for those  wholesalers not designated as Marlboro Ultra Lights distributors.  Retailers have used similar tactics to gain distribution of Marlboro Ultra Lights. A retailer will demand their distributor to supply the product or else they will take their business elsewhere. For example, Clark Oil (a chain of 800 stores throughout the Midwest) threatened to take their business to a wholesaler that could supply them with Marlboro Ultra Lights. In addition, a Sam's Club in  Indianapolis allegedly solicited retail accounts in Northwest Indiana. Please note, the sales organization has attempted at least two times in the past to contain  distribution of the test market. Philip Morris notified direct customers by letter in April 1991 and May 1992 that we would discontinue selling test market product to any customer selling outside the  designated area.  If you have any questions, please Jet me know.  iev  ce: §, Jannetta M. Zieser  eSecos130c __label__Memo
PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE Pittsburgh, PA October 31, 1999 Daily 436,765  Pruett wins pole,  steals spotlight from ttle duel,  By The Associaied Press  FONTANA, Calif. — Scott Pruett stole the spotlight from the CART championship | bat tle, giving Toyota its first Champ Car pole yesterday | in qualifying: fort the season-end- ing Marlboro 500 at ornia Speedway,  Pruett, who will switch to NASCAR Win- ston Cup racing in 2000, turned his fast lap of 235.398 mph early in the session on the windswept two-mile oval. He then waited nervously for the drivers who were ‘fastest in practice to take a shot at him. a  “The toughest thing for me was td wait for Max,” Pruett said, referring to Max Pa- pis, who was the last driver in line and the favorite to win the pole.  But Papis, who ran out of fuel on the final lap of the U.S, 500 in July after dominating - the only other 500-mile event in the 20-race CART FedEx Series, came up short.again with a lap of 234.544.  Pruett, 39, who took over Papis’ ride with Arciero-Wells Racing after Papis left for Team Rahal this season, overshadowed the duel between series leader Dario Franchitti and rookie Juan Montoya, who go into to- .day’s race separated by only nine points in the battle for the $1 million PPG Cup title.  Montoya, who said he was slowed consid- -  “erably by the wind, qualified third at 234,251, with Franchitti eighth at 233,174. “My car was perfect,” Montoya said. “It  was just too windy. If you asked me what I ~  would change if] oa ied again, I would say, ‘Nothing.’ I'm confident. We have a good car.” Franchitti needs only to finish ahead of Montoya to win his érst series champi- onship, If Franchitti finishes in the top three, the Colombian cannot overcome hislead,  -  Z089E20802 __label__News

By GINA KOLATA     Y most objective meas- ures, Dr. Julie A. Swain is, like her twin sister, a stun- ning success.  She is the chief of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, a member of a Food and Drug Administration com- mittee that evaluates new devices, a member of an Agency for Health Care Policy committee that devel- ops medical practice guidelines and a member of the Defense Depart- ment’s peer-review committee for quality assurance.  A decade ago, when she was at Louisiana State University, she was the first woman to be chief of cardi- ac surgery at an American medical school. And, like her sister, she evokes effusive praise from col- leagues.  Blt Dr. Swain is bitter about her career. She, like her sister, wants to be the best, and the best, to her, is a position as chief of cardiology at a major medical center, something no woman has yet achieved. ‘‘I’m chief of cardiology at a very small medi- cal school,"’ she said.  Her failure to reach her goal is not for lack of hard work. Dr. Swain     ‘typically works from 6:30 in the  morning until 9 at night. She is di-. vorced and has no children, and she lives and breathes surgery.  And, apparently, it is not for tack of talent. Dr. Michael DeBakey, the eminent heart surgeon at Baylor University in Houston, said she “meets what I would regard as the highest requirements.”  Dr. Swain “is very industrious and very devoted to her career and very able,"" he added. ‘'! think she has the ability to succeed at the very top."  But Dr. Swain believes that the top positions are essentially closed to women. If advancement were just based on “hard work and how good you are, it would be wonderful,” she said. Women surgeons say itis much harder for them to get jobs, and when they do get positions as sur- geons, Dr. Swain added, they find it hard to get patients. She explained that surgeons are dependent on re- ferrals for patients, and many doc-     Dr. Julie A. Swain at the Universi- ty of Nevada School of Medicine.     tors will not send their patients to a female heart surgeon.  “There probably will be a woman President before there is a woman chief of surgery at a major medical school,’ she said.  Dr. Stephen E. Epstein, chief of cardiology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethes- da, Md., who has worked with Dr. Swain, said she is an “excellent car- diac surgeon” and that “she did a superb job’’ at the heart institute. | But he agrees that heart surgery “is a very hard field to get into as a woman."  Dr. DeBakey was reluctant to say that a hostile climate toward women had kept Dr. Swain and other able women from the top ranks. There are few such positions and many talented surgeons, he said. ‘‘Some- times it's just related to what oppor- Cuniues are available,” he said. “Lady luck plays a role."  But Dr. Swain said that if she could live her life over again, she would steer clear of surgery. ‘I would probably do interventional cardiology,”” she said. __label__News

Coo  Ce os ~=--  ee cet”  Four previous major reviews on the composition “of cigarette  smoke have been published by Johnstone and Plimmer in 1959 (30), Stedman in 1968 (67), on the vapor phase of smoke by Elmenhorst ‘and Schultz in 1968 (12) and on nitrogenous smoke components by - Neurath in 1969 (46).

Subject:  To:  RJR Interoffice Memorandum  BRIGHT 85/100 Date: January 4, 1984 1984 Flavor Development  Dr. D. L. Roberts i¢ From: R. F. McCarthy  Tne recent visit to Biddle Sawyer was very encouraging with regard to the improved flavor components which were reviewed for the BRIGHT filter flavor  system. The deterpinated hearts of peppermint represent a giant step for- ward in the fact that they will move us closer to a filter flavor system  which can be quantitatively/qualitatively monitored. Although we are at an impasse at this time in being able to monitor the current filter flavor sys- tem, it is imperative that we not lose sight of this objective in 1984. It is requested that all filter flavor development work be directed toward simplifying and reducing the number of flavor components added to the fil- ter. A revised flavor system with only peppermint hearts in the filter would be of the greatest interest in recognition of the current dilenma of not being able to monitor peppermint on our current products.  In addition to the present flavor improvement work which is currently under- way, it is requested that the aforementioned approach be assigned a level of  importance and priority that is commensurate with any flavor improvement work in 1984.  Please advise if there are any questions or concerns.     sdch  xe: Mr. B. V. Hardin Mr. R. L. Willard Mr. J. D. Phillips Ms. M. M. Wong Ms. B. J. Dula Dr. B. M. Lawrence  Ms. G. C.

Mercedes-Benz power under the Peuske engine covers is reportedly producing from 150 to 300 more horsepower than any of the conventional turbocharged Indy V8s or Buick V6és in the 33-car field.

Taking more of the total market all the time, filter smokes Agure to climb even faster, observers believe, now that smokers are back to fidgeting about their health. Meanwhile, filter folks are turning loose a clamor of claims in current promotion. Riggio Tobacco, which the king-size Regent, came out with a filter-tip Regent last week and claims it is the “only one to give you filtered smoke but unfiltered flavor.” Da Maurier, a recent filter entry, is Full paging this appeal: “Start today to smoke with greater peace of mind... with the world’s most efficient filter.” P. Lorillard’s Kent, now also king-size, says its filter “takes out more nicotine and tars than any other filter cigarette.” Liggett & Myers continues to thunder claims for its L&M Filter and repor.s sales are soaring. Brown & William. son is on a rampage of TV spots for its Viceroy; other filters are shrilling thaw safeguards to uncisy smokers. Ant American ‘lohaees. onl major  company without a filter offering, al- most certanly will have one soon.  None of this advertising, except Regent's, broke after release of Amer- {ean Cancer Society’s study on effects of smoking. But filter makers won't be long in ig & cue from the study, judging from du Maurier’s repeated advice on how to smoke “with greater peace of mind.” Impact of ACS’ study, too, will put an edge on competition between filters. Already Kent, which has steadily insisted its micronite filter is the best of any major brand, is un- derstood to be bristling wver du Maurier claim to the “most efficient Blter.”  Meanwhile, the cigarette clan as a whole is making no public predictions on the effect of the ACS report.

Subject: Ranch Roller Bag  Katie -- As discussed, Legal has a patent issue with the wheels on the catalog roller-bag. (We were reordering the exact bag without branding for the Ranch program.) Beth and | presented this bag as a back-up option, when we learned that there would be a long trademark search on the telescoping handle bag. We were under the impression that this option would easily be approved. Unfortunately, this assumption was wrong, since over the past few years (since the catalog version) a patent has been filed on the wheel housing/mechanism.  Based on this assumption of clearance, we placed an order for the first 500 ($16,750) to meet the April delivery date. Another PO was set up far the balance of 2,900 (for del. in late June). This PO could have been cancelled any time before late April prod. start, if we didn't get legal clearance.  In discussions today, the following resolutions have been determined:  1) Wheeled bags already produced can be distributed at Ranch. We are confirming what part of 500 are finished to-date -- estimate: 300. Firm answer tomorrow.  2) Balance of 500 -- and entire new order of 2,900 will be produced without wheels.  3) Spec Revisions will involve: a) Moving side handie to be even with other side handle. (This was moved closer to  the base of the bag to make for easier wheeling.) b) Piastic runner strips on base of bag will be centered within length of bag. (Currently, they're closer to top end to allow room for wheel mechanism).  We will have these spec revisions made, and forward to Christine for Jay Mohr's approval. Since we cannot proceed with balance of order until we receive this approval, our second delivery date will most likely be delayed. Call if you have questions.  Lori  Page 1 __label__Email

This weck J drafted letters for those activists in Jowa who committed to write letters on the FDA, As you may recall we had 15 people agree to do this. As always, pcople promise and then sit on the letter for days on end so J had to do quite a bit of follow-up.  Thus far we have copics of letters from the following people:  David Payer - former candidate for legislature and small business owner Jim Raife - health food store owner  Jim Kuhlman - health care professional  Todd Rector - Auditor  Mary Rector - Athritis sufferer  Michael Bennett - former candidate for legislature and real estate agent  The subjects of the letters covered a broad range. They included Mary Rector's inability lo purchase DMSO, the FDA's attempt to regulae tobacco, the FDA's policing of medical devices, the regulation of the health food industry, the regulation of vitamins and drug approval. I tried to vary the topics as much as possible.  Letters to the editor were also sent to the DesMoines Register covering the same topics. I expect to have copies of the remaining letters back to me by the end of the week, I'm faxing you copies of the letters I do have now.

Klein CONDITION LETTER - First Quarter, 1998  LORILLARD SALES TRENDS  Maverick Specials - We continue to gain distribution and volume in General Market C-Stores  Newport -  Kent/True -  Old Gold -  Style -  and Gas Station's as well as Cigarette Stores and Tax Differential outlets. Package sales are still growing in Urban Special Emphasis Calls. The Menthol packings are now becoming firmly established, and the 100 MM packings are becoming the best sellers overall. We continue to enjoy an average 10¢ price advantage in most retail outlets vs. Doral and GPC.  The Box packings continue to grow throughout the area. In many cases Newport Box Parent outsells Newport Soft. Newport Light Box 80's continue to experience excellent increases in sales and distribution. Most retailers are maintaining larger inventories which aids in excellent increased competitive trial. The Light Box 100's are also benefiting from renewed trial.  Each of these brand families continue to decline in sales with the exception of the Kent Heavy-Up in Region 17. This program allows Kent to maintain sales.  Sales in Region 25 have decreased dramatically due to the elimination of promotional support. Retailers report there are some brand loyal consumers who are continuing to purchase the brand without a coupon.  Clean-Up Program achieved our objectives, and the buy-down in the volume accounts moved the remaining inventory through in a timely manner.  6VELLVEs __label__Memo

HUMAN DILUTION MEASUREMENTS WITH VARYING LENGTHS OF CIGARETTES EXTENDING: FROM PUFF PROFILE ANALYZER HOLDER  Filter dilution determinations using the Puff Parameter Analyzer (PPA) were made on Barclay-type cigarettes! for each of 45 human smokers. For each subject, the filter dilution was determined using three methods: (a) 10 mm of filter available for the smoker, (b) 15 mm of filter available for the smoker, and (c) cigarette smoked with a plastic tip to prevent any occlusion or crushing of the grooves. The objective was to determine whether there was a consistent difference in the reduction of filter dilution observed between having 10 or 15 millimeters of filter available to the smoker. This was prompted by the fact that the glass: holder for the PPA leaves  10 mm of the cigarette filter exposed to the smoker which could  force the smoker to alter his puffing pattern.  The results, presented in Table 1, show that the test with 10 mm of filter available had an average dilution reduced to 32% with a standard deviation of 12%, while the test with 15 mm of filter available had an average dilution reduced to 37% with a standard deviation of 13%. While the difference between the two methods is statistically significant, the magnitudes of the  reduction are of the same order using either method.  ‘Cigarettes with grooved filters and non-porous plugwrap were made with the perforations located 17 millimeters from the mouth end specifically for this test.

June 18, 1977.  Hearing Clerk's Office, Docket No. 77P-0185 Food and Drug Administration  Room 4-65, 5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville, Md. 20857  Dear Sirs:  This is to advise you that I strongly support the immediate, strict regulation by the Food and Drug Administration of all cigarettes containing nicotine, in accordance with the petition filed with you by Action on Smoking and Health.  There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that cigarettes containing nicotine fall clearly within the definition of "drugs" which "are articles intended to affect the function of the body of man." In addition, the evidence against such cigarettes as a dangerous health hazard, both to the smokers themselves and to non-smokers unavoidably exposed to a smoky environment, is overwhelming - far stronger, in fact, than any evidence yet revealed against saccharin, which is already acknowledged to be under your jurisdiction and concerning which you have already taken definitive action.  Your prompt regulation of cigarettes containing nicotine can be a giant step toward saving untold numbers of U.S. residents, now living and as yet unborn, from illness and premature death due to lung cancer, heart disease and other human ailments already linked to cigarette  smoking.  ph E.

COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FoR == Uk Y ED ABSORPTION OF HCN; PM #576 WLK ET  Drs. Norman B. Rainer and Charles B.pHoelzel of the Research and Development Department of Philip*Morrts;-hreos— disclosed to me on and before February 4, 1971, their im-  proved absorbents for hydrogen cyanide.  The invention is a class of absorbents for HCN for use in cigaret filters and other applications where selec- tivity is desired, comprising amine complexes of certain heavy metal salts, particularly the complexes of cuprous salts, carried on solid substrates,  For selective removal of HCN from cigaret smoke various filter compositions have been proposed. Alkaline additives such as alkali metal carbonates and the like have been ap- plied to conventional filter materials. Activated carbon or charcoal with a surface treatment of copper salt converted by heat to the oxide have been tried. Keith et al, U. S. #3,251,365 discloses iron and zinc oxides on high-area car- riers. Horsewell et al, U. S. #3,550,600 employs zinc acetate as absorbent,made alkaline with certain bases such as polyethylenimine, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, or borax. These compositions have some effectiveness in removing HCN preferentially. The best results reported show 50 to 85%  removal of HCN. Moreover, the activated carbon types remove Significant proportions of other gas phase smoke components,  so that there is an effect on flavor of the smoke stream.  The present inventors have discovered that it is possible to remove 90% to 100% of the HCN from smoke, by the proper choice of absorbent quantity, substrate, and condi- tions as will be described in detail below. At least certain of these absorbents have been shown to be relatively harmless and non-toxic. They are easily prepared and quite inexpensive.  The substrate for the complex should be a solid having a surface area of at least one square meter per gram and preferably much larger. A particularly effective support will be discussed below. The complex compound may be applied to this from solution (perhaps 0.2% to 5% concentration) in a volatile solvent, such as alcohol, and the solvent evaporated. Other familiar methods of applying or distributing the absor- bent may be used. The absorbent/support is then made a part of the cigaret filter so that the smoke will have intimate contact with it. If the support is granular, this may be done by filling a space in a filter plug with the material so as to  ESTz0r9z07 __label__Scientific

Head, Department of Cytochemistry  Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research Rue du Bugnon 21  1005 Lausanne (Vaud)  Switzerland  Dear Doctor Lauchtenberger:  | Your letter of May 11, 1968 was read and discussed at the May 25th meeting of our Scientific Advisory Board,  It was their consensus that further areas of common scientific interest between you and the Board may be found when aufficient time has been given to the analysis of results obtain ed in the past, improvement of mechanical equipment for exposing animals to smoke inhalation, digeussion of virus problems, etc. Hence, they did not feel, ready to encourage you to give notice to present members of your staff who might be needed for further projects in future.  in order to provide time for you to conclude your present work, for stock-taking and planning conferences on future programs, they agreed to continue support to your program at substantially the current level to a termination date of January 1, 1969. Meanwhile, the Board indicated a willingness to consider work other than the  present project if you can advise them of a project of interest to both you and the Board.  If you are ready with any such proposal by August 1, 1968, it can be considered at the September lth meeting of the Board. The next meeting thereafter will be on an undetermined date in December with a deadline on November 1st.  As you know, certain steps are being undertaken in the hope of perfecting the equipment for chronic exposure of small animals to whole, fresh, normal cigarette smoke and of developing a better method for measuring the actual exposure of lung surfaces, especially to particulate material. While it is hoped that these goals may be reached quickly, there is an element of uncertainty as to when every- thing will be considered ready for resuming animal inhalation studies on a large scale. Meanwhile, however, plans can be laid, feasibility studies may be practicable and perhaps studies of gas-phase inhalation or of gas-phase constituents may be possible, and studies of cells  -— in culture-couid be-continued.,- There are also many virus-probiens ——  requiring attention and some of these might be emphasized during the interim, __label__Letter

HIGHLIGHTS 5:48 PM MON., 23 JAN., 1984 BIGBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH  i.Smoke Component Dose (Chamberlin, Reynolds)  Software has been developed for the HP-84B computer which success- fully transmits positioning and valving commands to the human-mimnic smoking machine controller. The timing of the commands (one command every 40 milliseconds) appears to be entirely adequate. Software for the HP-1000 computer which translates puff-profile data into positioning commands is already on hand. Minor modifications of this software are required to incorporate valving commands. Once this is complete, a test in which full sets of commands will be generated, downloaded to the HP  HP-86B, and transmitted te the smoking machine will be made. Assuming the success of this test, the smoking machine will be operational with-  in a matter of days.  2. Psychophysiology (Gilbert, Chamberlin, Ingram)  Computer processing of the EEG data from the smoking and stress  study is complete, including the generation of plots of EEG power spec-— tra. Essentially all other data from the smoking and stress study have  been entered into computer data files, proofread and corrected. Statis- tical analyses of these data are underway. Preliminary results should  be available shortly.  3. Nicotine Pharmacology (Lippiello, Davis, Robinson, Ingram)  The first experiments with the new, tritiated, L-nicotine have  been completed. The binding affininty (Kd ~ 20 nM) and maximum binding Capacity (Bmax ~ 100 fmoles/mg protein>d of the surine neuroblastona-as—  sociated receptor sites agree well with our previously reported values. The Baax value translates into roughly 2000 binding sites per cell. Ex- periments to determine the pharmacological specificity of these sites  have commenced. |  The Zeiss ICM405 phase/fluorescence microscope has been ordered. |  Dr. John Robinson is attending the Winter Brain Research Confer- ence in Colorado. At this meeting, he will confer with Dr. Deaduwyler (Bowman Gray School of Medicine) and Dr. Dudek (Tulane University) in  regard to establishing research protocols for the study of the effects of nicotine on the rat hypothalamus. It is hoped that this work can be  carried out at Bowman Gray concurrently with recently funded work on the rat hippocampus. Additionally, Dr. Robinson will consult with Dr. Dead- wyler and Dr. Weodward (Univ. of Texas Medical Center at Dallas) in re- gard to generation of research proposals for the thorough investigation of the effects of nicotine on the rat brain by means of in-vive ionto- phoresis and/or imaging of metabolic sites of 2-deaexyglucose.  4. Blood Chemistry (Davis, Ingram)  ( The procedure described.by Curvall, et al. (3. Chromatog., 232, 283- 293 (4982]) for the extraction of nicotine and cotinine from blood plasma is under evaluation.

JOURNAL-AMERICAN New York, New York November 18, 1957  ADVERTISING AGE December 2, 1957  Cancer May Have Multiple Causes, Says TIRC’s Hockett  New Yorke, Nov. 26—An abun- dance of evidence is accumulating that shows lung cancer cennot be explained by any single, simple factor, such as cigaret smoking, Dr. Robert C. Hockett, associate sci- entific director of the Tobacco In- dustry Research Committee, told the New York City Advertising Men’s Post 209 of the American Legion last week.  “A care is sometimes made for the anti-clgarct theory by selecting the evidence,” Dr. Hockett said. “JLikewlse, a case against this the- ory can also be made by selecting the evidence.  “But taking all the known face tors in balance, one must arrive ct the conclusion that the answer or answers to human Jung cancer just aren’t known. Anyone may speculate on hie oct theory, hit such opinions should not be con- fused witn racts."  Describing the work of the scl- entific advisory board of the To- bacco Industry Research Commit- tee, Dr. Hockett said that the board of nine independent scientists has compiete freedom in the research policy and program, and has al- located about $2,000,000 so far in  grants to scientists working in ed- ucctional, medical and research in-  stitutions.  @ The position of the board, he said, is that so far too Little is known about lung cancer and heart disease to warrant any con- clusions as to specific cause or causes.  “Factors statistically associated with lung cancer do not necessari- ly have a causative role,” Dr. Hockett said. “The significance of the more recent studies is that they show lung cancer is related to a vast number of factors.  “It is certainly not justified tc assign to any one of them a pri- mary causative role, especially when medical science is just be- ginning to lift the curtain on thi unknowns about cancer.”  Emphasizing that getieralization: about the effects of smoking on health are unwarranted, Dr. Hock- ett cited a scientific paper giver last week at the Southern Medica’ Assn. meeting (AA, Nov. 1%) A study of 11,000 workers of Amer:  fean Tobacce Co. showed that thr workers smoke nearly ¢wir- i much a> the average smoker abc sty have average or below aver- age cancer and heart diserse risk: and live beyond the average lift expectancy.  a “If nothing else," Dr. Hocket: said, “this shows that smoking, ir itself isn't necessarily or invaria- bly associated with higher dest! rates or higher risks of cancer anc heart disease.” 2 __label__News
a  —_ ATTACHMENT C     TO: D. Dangoor DATE: February 16, 1990  FROM: N. Lund  SUBJECT: Marlboro Ultra Lights  This provides an alternative to our February lst testing plan for  Marlboro Ultra Lights. We recommend replacing the original proposal with a plan to open new test market(s) with alternate packaging,  (soft), and marketing programs highly targeted to competitive smokers.  Rationale for this direction is discussed below. Rich’s recommendation is attached. It provides more detailed support and begins to sketch out the new plan.     Brand developed a plan to increase competitive conversion and restore Lights growth trend in the current test markets. While the plan would likely achieve these objectives, full costing out of the  programs discloses a spending level so high as to raise serious questions about expandability and projectability of results. This  factor, combined with several strategic issues outlined below, lead us to a recommendation to abandon development of the Phase II plan in current test markets. We believe we can generate new, perhaps more  relevant, learning through new test market(s).  TEST MARKET RESULTS SUMMARY  Performance in three test markets suggests Marlboro Ultra Lights is likely to achieve a 1.2 ~ 1.4 share of market, contributing however only +.3 incremental share points to PM and +.5 to Marlboro. Further, the entry is not demonstrating growth and Marlboro Lights has been destabilized. While nearly 60% of converters fall within our 25-44 year old target, smokers fall disproportionately to the younger end of that target.  STRATEGIC ISSUES Ideal Ultra Launch Timing/Implications  Brand believes Marlboro Ultra Lights should ideally be launched when such a launch would add significant on-going growth for the brand.  We believe that two factors would make for the ideal launch environment: 1) a vital ultra category defined by accelerated growth and/or 2) a slow down in Marlboro Lights growth trend. Accelerated category growth could result from heightened health/social concerns and/or a marketplace destabilized by the introduction of a  revolutionary product.  SOISICTH IG __label__Memo

=D , or 097985 RIF_  RJR INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM CO N FI f) E NTA |  Subject: Extramural UBS and Date: October 8, 1985  Drosophila Assays yr. From: Dr. R. Oeskin  To: Dr. W. Sf Simmon a) ily “le le  This is to update you on the plan for conducting unscheduled DNA  synthesis (UDS) and SLRL Drosophila assays extramurally. In  conversations with G. Burger and J. Hayes it was confirmed that we  would ask SRI and Litton (Hazelton) to conduct the in-vitro UDS  assay using two samples of cigarette condensate. One sample would  be from a Kentucky reference cigarette (1R4F) and the second  comparative sample would be from a RAN product. The cost | associated with this assay for two (2) samples at SRI would be | $11,000 and at Litton would be $10,400, for a total of $21,400.  Johnnie Hayes has contacted Or. Valencia at Wisconsin and she is  fowarding a price list to us for the Drosophila assay. Litton  charges $23,500 for a routine Drosophila assay. I suggest that we  meet with Gary, Johnnie, Chin, and Bob Suber to decide on a  strategy for submitting samples for the Drosophila assay. 1 estimate that it would cost approximately $100,000 to run two (2)  samples through the Drosophila assay at two labs. This is based upon Litton's price list. This appears to be prohibitive and  should be limited to the minimum number of samples.        Johnnie Hayes is initiating conversations with Litton and I have requested a proposal from SRI to conduct the in-vitro UDS assay. Fach lab will also be asked to provide us with a schedule for initiation of assays and delivery of draft final reports. I expect that we can have contacts in place and can send samples no later  than October 21, 1985.  cc: Dr. A. W. Hayes  Dr. R. L. Suber Dr. G. T. Burger Dr. J. R. Hayes Dr. C. K. Lee Dr. W. Y.

Mitsuteru Numazawa*? and Masao Nagaoka Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai 983, Japon Yoshio Osawa*?  Medical Foundation of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo, New York 14903 Received October 22, 1981  Synthesis of 16a-hydroxy-17-oxo stervids 3, Sb, and 6b and 36,16a-dihydrozy-6-17-ozoandrasten-3-yl sulfate (2) from 16a-bromo-17-ox0 steroids 1, 5a, and 6a and the reaction mechanism of the controlled alkaline hydrolysis are described. Treatment of the bromo ketones with NaQH in aqueous DMF gave the 16c-hydroxy 17-ketones sterenoelectively in 95% yield without formation of other ketols. The eodium salt of 3-sulfate 7 was also obtained in ons step in 85% yield from the bromo ketone (fa). Isotope-labeling experiments and time-course studies showed that equilibration between the 16-bromo epimera Il and 2 precedes the formation of 8, in which the true intermediate is 2 and not 1, and that the ketal 8 is formed by the direct S,2 displacement of the 166-bromine. The 169-mcrpholino derivative 8 obtained by reaction of | with morpholine was shown to be an isomerized product of the 16a isomer which is produced also by S,2 displacement of the 168-bromine. The mechanism of keto! rearrangement of 3 to the 178-hydroxy-16-o20 compound 4 was found to involve a hydration to the carbonyl function. The new hydration-dehydration mechanism is proposed for the ketol rearrangement.

- Attachment II  Pros and Cons of Group Blending at RJR Stemmeries as Assessed by Leaf Program  T. Je Porter, vr. = 2/16/89 Pros  i. Market and grade mixing in staging areas prior to stemming will yield a consistent group prior to  processing.  2. with multiple in-feeding of farm bales/prize room tersa bales, there will be good grade/market/bale mixing.  3. Group vs. grade runs will result in longer stemming runs with fewer changeovers. strip particle size should improve and moisture and stem content should be in  better control.  4. With fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for blending, stemmery groups will have to be run in statistical process control for nicotine.  5. Blending bulkers will be used for blending, not simply for conveying tobacco.  6. Fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units will result in better utilization of storage space and simplified retrieval for blending.  7. Storage remnants will be reduced.  8. Group blending at the stemmeries lends itself to whole container blending at primaries.  9. Blend modeling will be simplified with fewer grade/belt/crop/nicotine units available for use.     1. Increased manpower and larger staging areas will be required. More time and effort will have to be devoted  to planning/executing required staging.  2. Multiple in-feeding units will have to be purchased and installed.  3. Group market/grade/bale staging may be by-passed if staging is deemed inefficient/inconvenient by stemmery  personnel.  c9TS 9b60S __label__Report

There is a negative association with gross national product per capita and a positive but mnconsis- lent assocration with saturated and monounsaturated  fai intake. The principal finding 3 8 strong and specific Negative assoqalon between schzmic heart-disease  deaths and alcohol consumption. This 1s shown to be wholly attributable to we consumption.  Summary  INTRODUCTION  Ix a previous study! we reporied on the associations between age-specific to1al mortahwy and a vanety of eco nome, heatth-service, and dietary varsables in 18 devel- oped countries. Our conclusion was that, in general, the healih-service factors showed neghgible association with morality, the dietary factors were of hitle amporiance, and the only consistent pattern was 9 negative associ- ation between gross nauonal product (G.N.P.) per capita and mortality. Age-specific total mortality is,  _however, 8 crude measure by which to compare coun-  tries and so we have embarked upon a comparison of parucular diseases.

The cards were developed in response to the interests of Doral smokers. We surveyed Doral smokers about their interests and hobbies last year and nearly half of them told us that they are "collectors." The Doral collector cards align with these adult smokers’ general interest in collectibles.  The intent of the program is absolutely not designed to get you to smoke more cigarettes.

Tot  From:  Subject:  ) PHILIP MORRIS INCORPOR =D INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Mrs. Thelma C. Heatwole . pate: December 23, 1968  G. E. Inskeep Remarks on Office Action on Helf, 582-518, PM #472  The bentonite in the present specification is not described as "calcined" and is not intended to be, but is the naturally occurring finely divided or substantially colloidal form.  Kauffman specifies and claims repeatedly calcined bentonite as the carrier for medicaments or vaporizable smoke-treating agents, and describes the calcined bentonite as having "few, Lf any, of the distinguishing characteristics by which bentonites are commonly identified and that it is a substantially different substance from the starting or non-calcined bentonite." (p. 3, col. 2, 1. 44). The calcined product is said to be no Longer colloidal. The agglomeration which is responsible for this means  that the product would not have the characteristics itemized on p. 7, 1. 12, of the present specification, since there would be  considerable pores and fissures and the particles could absorb nicotine (at least in the sense of taking the liquid into the pores). The molded form of Kauffman would be even less applicable.  The calcined bentonite is said to be a selective adsorbent for nicotine. This would make it unsuitable for choice as a carrier intended to release nicotine to the smoke; that is, it could hardly be characterized as a "weak adsorbent," by the definition of our specification. As was remarked in regard to the first Office Action, our requirement for weak adsorbents for nicotine rules out those, as in Irby, et al., and Kauffman, having a strong affinity for it. Because they do not teach the use of weak adsorbents, those references do not, even when taken with Bavley, et al., make obvious the present invention.  It is admittedly unfortunate that one or two of our weak adsorbents (silica gel, zeolite) have the same name as adsorbents  eee  EISPLEQSO? __label__Memo

NICOTINE PREDICTION MODEL     A statistical computer model would show how much Nicotine will be in our cigarettes after 2 years aging based on Nicotine In the tobacco crop, our purchase pattern, the effects of aging, cigarette design parameters (paper porésity, filter density, etc.), tobacco processing’  (¥ G7, % GI3, Ammonitation, de-nic, etc.), and blending (% grades, belts, tobacco types, etc.).

PUFFED TOBACCO  The study of puffing with volatile liquids, e.g., Freon-11, near ambient temperature has been continued to-extend the useful range of operating conditions. The process had produced a 230% increase in cross- sectional area of flue-cured stem sections previously. The concentration of Freon-11 vapor in the atmosphere-used to treat the stem sections has been estimated to be 5.4 mg./ml. by MS. An attempt to estimate the quantity of Freon-11 absorbed by the stem sections continues.  The stem section method has been applied to puffing with aqueous C02.

J     ARTICLES  Xenograft Model of Progressive Human  Proliferative Breast Disease  Fred R. Miller, Herbert D. Soule, Larry Tait, Robert J. Pauley, Sandra R. Wolman, Peter J. Dawson, Gloria H. Heppner*     Background: Progression of proliferative breast disease has been associated with increased risk for development of invasive carcinoma. Cell lines have been developed to facilitate the study of this process. Human cell] line MCFIO0A originated from spontaneous immortalization of breast epithelial cells obtained from a patient with fibrocystic disease, and cell lines MCF10AneoN and MCF10AneoT were created by stable transfection of these cells with the neomycin-resistance gene and either the HRAS gene or the mutated T-24 HRAS gene, re- spectively. Purpose: Our goal was to develop an experimental model of progressive human proliferative breast disease. Methods: MCF10A, MCF10AneoN, and MCF10AneoT cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of male nude/beige (C57/BALB/c nu/nu bg/ bg) mice (12 mice for each cell type). These mice were examined periodically for formation and persistence or growth of palpable nodules. One mouse per group was killed 1 week after cell injection; thereafter, mice were observed as long as possible. Cells were recovered from palpable lesions by enzymatic dissociation of the excised lesions. Cells re-established in tissue culture from a week-14 tumor (MCF10AneoT.TG1) were injected into 12 male nude/beige mice. Southern blot hybridization analysis of the HRAS gene locus and cytogenetic analyses were performed. Results: Transplanted MCF10A and MCF10AneoN cells formed transient, small palpable nodules that regressed and disappeared during the 4th and 5th weeks. In 10 of the 12 mice, T-24 HRAS gene- transfected MCF10A cells (MCF10AneoT) formed small, flat nodules that persisted for at least 1 year. Three of these xenografts became carcinomas. One (removed 7 weeks after transplantation) was an undifferentiated carcinoma composed of polygonal cells with large, vesicular nuclei and numerous mitoses. The second (removed after 14 weeks) was an invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The third (removed after 56 weeks) was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Initially, xenografts of MCFLOAneoT.TG1 cells showed intraductal proliferative changes; after 23 weeks, the lesions showed  Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 85, No. 21, November 3, 1993  histologic features resembling those seen in atypical hyperplasia of the human breast, and later lesions showed characteristics of carcinoma in situ. The MCF10 lineage of cells of three MCF10AneoT.TG1 xenografts was confirmed by DNA fingerprinting and karyotype anal- ysis. Conclusions: MCF10AneoT and MCF10AneoT.TG1 comprise a transplantable xenograft medel that produces a broad spectrum of human proliferative breast disease. Implications: The reproducible establishment of repre- sentative stages in early breast cancer progression from the MCF10 model offers a new opportunity to analyze critical events of carcinogenesis and progression in breast cancer. [J Natl Cancer Inst 85:1725-1732, 1993]     Many human carcinomas evolve via a sequence from benign hyperplasia through atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ and eventually to fully malignant, invasive tumors with the potential to metastasize. In the case of colorectal neoplasia, the well-recognized polyp-to-carcinoma sequence is associated with a series of specific genetic alterations (7). Although the colon cancer model has become a paradigm for solid tumor development, definition of critical genetic events in breast cancer has been hampered by the lengthy natural history, architectural complexity, and relative inaccessibility for sampling of breast cancers, particularly at the small, early stages. In the human female breast, a spectrum of pathologic change has been termed proliferative breast disease. The progression of histopathologic features of proliferative breast disease has been associated with increased risk for the development of invasive carcinoma (2). Women with the most severe form of proliferative breast disease, atypical hyperplasia, have a fourfold to fivefold increased relative risk of developing breast cancer.  A series of human mammary epithelial cell lines has been derived at the Michigan Cancer Foundation from a woman with fibrocystic disease.

As you know, the impacts of secoridhand tobacco smoke ~ especially in children - are now Gocumented as significant. I hope you will join your colleagues in making New England the region of the country that shows the vay for  the rest of America when it comes to addressing this potential public health issue.  You can most directly do so by adopting no smoking policies in all of your restaurants. This single act would make a ‘substantial impact - both in the health of your customers and in setting an example for others in your industry.  EPA has classified Environmental Tobacco smoke (ETS) as a known human carcinogen. EPA has also documented that ETS causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. Not only does ETS aggravate syaptoaus in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children, but it also causes thousands of non-asthmatic children to develop the condition each year.  The service and quality you offer in your restaurants attracts the segment of our population which is most vulnerable to secondhand gnoke - teenagers and young children. Please consider this request. _an@ help us reduce the threat of secondhand smoke on all your customers, especially the youngest and most vulnerable.  ZI volunteer the support of EPA to assist you in obtaining this goal. Thank you.

Test Data  As we discussed over the phone, this memo requests that your Department develop the capability to routinely perform various computer statistical  analyses of H.T.I. product test data tapes for the Market Research Department.  We are all pleased about the progress your group has made along with  that of Tom Budne in the development of improved and more sophisticated statistical analyses of product test data. Now that this work is being done on a routine basis for P.0.L. tests, it seems worthwhile expanding this system to cover H.T.I. There are several advantages jin Richmond's performing the same statistical analyses on H.T.I. and P.O.L. data.  The first is greater comparability in evaluating product tests results. Another is that any improvements your Department, Tom Budne or the Market  Research Department make in these analyses can be shared. Finally, the proprietary nature of such statistical analyses will be preserved.  Let me know at your earliest convenience how best we can implement such a program.  Thank you for your cooperation.

TOBACCO June 17, 1960  Tobacco Man’‘s “Bible” .. .  HTBOO026*  Heimann’s New Book Traces History of Tobacco in U.S.  By Gerard Tetloy “Tobaccos" Editor in Danville, Va.  One of the most comprehensive works on the history of tobacco has just come off the press of the McGraw- Hill Publishing Company, New York,— a book which gives promise of being the tobacco man’s “Bible.”  Entitled “Tobacco and Americans,” it is the work of Robert K. Heimann, a tobacco expert in the field of research and it contains 260 pages and 300 extraordinarily good illustrations. It sells for $7.50.  The libreries are not without books about tobacco, but this one is so sweeping in its treatment that it will occupy a place in many a home of tobacco men. It begins with the dis-  covery by the Spanish freebcoters and  lorers finding in South America indians smoking, ‘tobago’. It then pro- ceeds fo trace the growth of the smok- ing habit and the development of America’s Brst export business. Sir Walter Raleigh and John Randolph both grew aud shipped tobacco to England where it was used as a barter medium for things needed by the Virginia colony.  Many anecdotes are contained in this well written book and the chronol- ogy of progress. It is a valuable history of the vcd and the economic growth of this nation. There are graphs and charts showing the rise of smoking and  the whole history of man’s great solace rauges from the primitive usé of smoke to the filter tipped cigarette.  The illustrations,—-many of them made available by the Arents Collec- tion in the Public Library of New  York, give added zest to the book, especially the old advertisements of plug tobacco and cigarettes.  e rise of the Hue-cured system and the accidental discovery that char- coal cured tobacco a bright yellow by a sleepy slave in Caswell county, N.C. is developed. and the story also of Union troops, who, foraging through the Carolinas found granulated tobacco at Durham, N.C., which was popular- ized by the troops and which laid the foundation of a tobacco empire.  This is no buok to Le digested at one reading.

To:  From:  Date:  Lu TOBAGCO COMPANY  MEMORANDUM  Mr. Randy Spell MLL. Orlowsky  March 8, 2000.  Subject: Various - MPID  A few suggestions regarding various pieces of information to be considered for inclusion in MPID reports:  Az  Minor Mannfacturers/Brand Report  Too much emphasis is placed on share of market analysis {see report dated 3/6), and not enough on providing volume data, Percentage gains/losses of share is really not very relevant as opposed to this comparison based on volume. The report should include additional information related to volumes, i-e., annual shipments for 1998 and 1999, year- to-date 2000, and an attempt to project annualized volumes for 2000, as well as percentage changes. This does not have to be developed to the division level, but could be helpful either on a regional or area basis. The report tends to dwell on what occurred in the past. This is good up to a point, however, some hypothesizing as to futures would be better. Since this report is based on Excei data, we should also consider similar additions to the MSA shipment analyses.  Pricing Comparisons  Some time ago, we discussed developing average pricing comparisons to establish a history as well as a current picture of the percentage differentials between the various price segments of the matket. What is the status of this information?  Given the growing importance of minor brands, we shonid include, wherever possible, a compicte view of the market by including the minors along with the majors. I am not certain of the availability of the minor sales data. A review should be made te determine what is available and how this information can be included as part of the on-going analyses.  8S8rFISS __label__Memo

(2) Review and observe the operation of the forced-air curing system installed in selected flue-cured tobacco barns.  (3) Review other field tests and production programs.  SUMMARY:  In November, 1985, a virus-like disease of tobacco was observed that has the potential of threatening much of the Brazilian crop. Dr. Guy Gooding, NCSU phytopathologist and virus expert, agreed to conduct an on-site investigation of the disease. His observations, on-site antigen-antibody reactions, and subsequent laboratory tests demonstrated conclusively that the disease is caused by the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV).  The operation of several experimental forced-air curing systems, designed by Mr. Mike Bernard, and installed in flue-cured tobacco barns, was observed. In all cases, tobacco cured in the modified barns, as compared to that of  conventional barns, exhibited a significantly deeper-orange color and a sweeter aroma.  Most field investigation plots were beginning to suffer from the lack of rain; however, they will still produce valuable data. Most tests were set to the field early and are currently being harvested.  KEYWORDS:  Brazil, Curing, Disease, Seed, Flue-Cured Tobacco, Irrigation, Tomato Spotted Wilt, Varieties, Virus  STATUS:     This is an ongoing project. Future recommendations and research proposals are primarily contingent upon the results of the current experiments.  -l-  Sind 2LS0sS __label__Report
The Tobacco Institute        1875 I Street, Northwest Washington, DC 20006 (800) 424-9876 «+. ON YOUTH SMOKING REDUCING ACCESS  Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has proposed measures whereby states would take new legislative action on proposals such as licensing tobacco retailers and banning vending machines.  Such measures are misdirected. The National Automatic Merchandising Association, the national trade association of the vending industry, indicates that nearly 80 percent of all cigarette vending machines are located where persons under the age of 18 are not allowed access or rarely frequent.  o Almost a third of all cigarette vending machines are located in bars and cocktail lounges. Nearly 40 percent are found in industrial plants and offices, and almost 8 percent are found in hotels, motels and other generally adult settings. Thus, a ban on cigarette vending machines would primarily remove adult - not youth - access.  Those few vending machines that are located in places where youth may frequent should be supervised, The tobacco industry will support legislation in the states to accomplish this goal. This action -- not a ban on vending machines in workplaces or bars - will help reduce youth access.  Licensing of tobacco retailers is also suggested as a regulatory approach to reducing purchase of cigarettes by young people. However, the logic used -- that tobacco should be sold in the same restrictive manner as alcohol -- also argues against this as an effective solution.  o A 1989 Health and Human Services report tells us that "despite the fact that it is illegal for virtually all high school students and most college students to purchase alcoholic beverages, experience with alcohol is almost universal among them and active use is widespread." The report indicates that two of every three high school seniors report alcohol use in the last month.  Right now, it is illegal for cigarettes to be sold to minors in almost every state in the country. Laws are already in place. Enforcement of these laws is the best way to keep adult products, like cigarettes, from being sold to young people.  In the past — and for the future —~ the tobacco industry has maintained responsible positions on the issue of smoking by young people. The longstanding policy of cigarette manufacturers is that the choice to smoke or not to smoke is to be made by informed adults.     TIO607-1122 __label__Report

INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM  SUBJECT: Quarterly Report, July - September DATE: September 28, 1984  Chromatography Unit  TO: L. A. Lyerly FROM: K. L. Rush  ANALYTICAL SERVICE TECHNOLOGY Ne  During the third quarter, a number of modifications and improvements were made. Among these were:  New Carbonyls In Smoke Method (Ayers)  The new method developed by Analytical Methods has been put into routine service. Two operators have been trained to perform the analyses. No significant problems have been encountered and data have been provided for a number of studies. Demand for these analyses has been moderate and is expected to continue at about the same rate.  Low Level Menthol In Smoke (Summers)  Optimization of the current method for the determination of the menthol content of cigarette smoke has expanded the working range to include a lower detection limit. The interest in this lower level of detection has has been the result of interest in cigarettes with menthol contents less than 0.05%, as compared with normal levels of 0.40 to 1.25%. Analyses of smoke from cigarettes with menthol contents of QO, .07, 11, and .27 mg/cig gave deliveries of 0, .01, .02, and .04 ng/cig respectively. Tests are in progress by the Sensory Unit to determine the least detectable level by the smoking panelists. More tests may be requested; pending the results  of these tests. Determination Of Wintergreen By Liquid Chromatography (Greene, Womble)  Modification of the liquid chromatographic method for the determination of licorice content of tobacco products has provided the capability to simultaneously determine the content of wintergreen in wet snuff ag well. This eliminates a second sample preparation by distillation and both can be quantitated from the same LC chromatogram. Also, since sample preparation only requires an extraction, this procedure could be used on site to monitor the production of wet snuff. Comparison of data from the established GC method and the new LC method to determine the accuracy and recovery has been completed, and the precision study is underway. All data collected to date show very good agreement between the two methods,  and both produce valid results.   696E  Lznos __label__Letter

These formulations have been reviewed by toxicology and are acceptable.  CONCLUSTONS : * Both one-third and full printed boxes meet toluene specifications.  * The one-third printed box is close to spec on total solvents, and can be produced at current specifications.  * The full printed box is out of spec on total solvents, but probability is high that levels can be reduced by the use of the vacuum chamber and/or aqueous top lacquer. Archer R & OD will conduct trials to determine effectiveness of  these methods in reducing total solvents in the full printed box by mid- October.  # Future specifications will be based on total solvent levels.  1926 99606 __label__Report

I am aware that the renewal of this application was not funded. However, since the submission of the proposal, we have made considerable progress towards the complete purification of the hepatocyte-derived adipogenic factor. If we could obtain a phase out fund of 15,000 dollars, this will allow me to continue supporting for 6 months the visiting scientist from Japan who has been carrying out this project. This will give him the opportunity to complete the very difficult but very important purification of the adipogenic factor for which he has worked so hard. Unfortunately, the Cell Science Center is going through a financially very difficult time so that people that would be otherwise supported in the interim by the institutional fund do not have this opportunity anymore. This will also allow us to obtain additional data so that we can write application to support the whole project. I am aware that this is a very exceptional request but because of the long standing interest of the Council for innovative research, I am hopeful that this request will be favorably evaluated. I will be very happy to provide you with additional data on the progress of the purification of the adipogenic factor if you need them.  I would like to thank you for your kind consideration in this matter.  Sincerely yours, 5 3 _— repyar psf  oe - OG) a Ginette Serrero PhD Louth (Nh, é/ ‘ ) -  enior Scientist , f % .

Subject: Date: July 25, 1985  To: From: M. F. Dube  The objective of the SA #2 research program is to develop products with improved sidestream smoke odor which positively influence smokers' perceptions. New Brands Marketing has begun concept development for SA #2 products and have suggested the following timetable:  Qualitative Hypothesis Exploration 8/7 - 8/8 Tene 7 Qualitative Concept Refinement 8/26 - 8/29 whe ? Quantitative Positioning Concept Test W/O 9/23 ~woho 7 Results W/O 11/18  The Quantitative Positioning Concept Test will be used to determine optimum  positioning, smoker segment, business potential and aroma categories which support  the positioning. For the quantitative concept test, products will be required to  demonstrate the odor benefits, although these products will not be smoked by the — 0  consumer. UrRe ty bot? |  In order to provide these products, decisions must be made on which aroma categories  appropriately address consumer wants and match the positioning concepts. The  Marketing suggestion was that internal screening, prior qualitative learning and  "best judgment" be used to arbitrarily select the aroma categories. It would be  unwise to make such decisions based on such fragile evidence. It is the opinion of  the SA Team that in-depth marketing research be conducted. Such research should  answer certain basic questions:  1. How do consumers categorize odors/aromas? 7  2. Which of these aromas have positive connotations?  3. Which of these aromas are tobacco/smoke compatible?  4, How many segments exist with different odor preference (i.e. male, female, 35+, FF, FFLT, ULT, etc.)?  5. Is there a universally acceptable aroma which is not segment specific?  6. Are aroma/odor concerns of smokers and non-smokers the same? Is this issue of greater importance to one of these groups? Are their preferences alike or different?  7. Within an aroma category, there is a wide breath of odorants, Which of these inter-category odorants best address the problem, are preferable to the  consumer, mitigate the concern? __label__Letter

First one is 9:30 a.m. CST, Hoover Building, Des Moines IA. Later press conferences will be held in Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Mason City and Sioux City.  Assume product liability legislation is included in his proposals. Do we expect Miller to announce his support for a tax increas as well? Any other info on what he's supporting?  Towa AP wire story indicated that the tax issue is D.O.A. with Republicans, including Branstad. On the media front, it's probably best to let the Governor and other legislators speak out against increasing taxes of any kind. If they're going to oppose the tax increase, we might be better off focusing the efforts of our allies on the other components of Miller's agenda. Thoughts? __label__Email

Medizinisches Institut ftir Umwelthygiene an der Univer- sitit Dusseldorf, Abt. fiir Psychophysiologie  D-4000 Diisseldorf, Fed.Rep. of Germany  Results from a pilot study (I) as well as preliminary findings from an exten— ded study (II) will be presented, in which either non-smoking students (I) or non-smoking adults from the general population (II) were exposed to ETS produced by an active smoker in a social, experimentally controlled setting.  Results from study I are based on 64 Ss of both sexes exposed to ETS corres ponding to either 0, 2.5, 5, and 15 ppm dcO. Duration of exposure was 60 minutes and CO was continuously monitored by IR-spectroscopy. Objective (eye blinks, la- crymal flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration) as well as subjective measures based on questionnaire items were taken at 20' intervals. COHb was mea- sured before and after ETS-exposure. Significant effects of exposure were found for blinks, lacrymal flow, COHb, as well as for most of the questionnaire—based information. With the exception of the questionnaire-variables, exhibiting dose- response-relationship, the majority of dependent variables showed clear threshold characteristics: The 15 ppm-condition only was significantly different from the control level. From this finding the tentative conclusion is drawn for a no-ad- verse effect-level for ETS to be located between 5 and 15 ppm, rather than below  5 ppm. (WINNEKE et al., 1984).  In order to substantiate this conclusion and to gain information about the generalizability of the annoyance-response a second extended study (II) was con- Gucted, in which the psychophysiological effects of ETS—exposure will be compared to those of noise- and odour-exposure; this study is not yet completed. The Ss of this study were selected from the general population living in noise- and odor- problem-areas of the city of Diisseldorf. Based on a social survey covering 2300 individuals only non-smokers from extreme groups with high or low annoyance characteristics, respectively, were asked to participate in the experimental part of the study. These were exposed in a social setting to ETS corresponding to aco of 0, 5 and 10 ppm. Apart from few technical modifications the set of outccme- measures as well as the basic experimental structure was identical to that of the pilot study (I). Results based on the first set of 72 Ss will be presented and  Winneke,G., K.Plischke, A.Roscovanu, and H.-W.Schlipkéter: Patterns and Determi- nants of Reaction to Tobacco Smoke in an Experimental Exposure Setting In: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Idoor Air Quali-  ty and Climate, vol.2, 351-356 (1984)  6ene z£b90S __label__Report

The Liggett “Settlement” Doesn’t Change the Facts  The law isn’t determined by public relations.  That’s why courts and juries have consistently rejected arguments that the tobacco industry should pay damages to smokers, and why courts continue to insist that states cannot ignore the fact that individuals choose to smoke and states choose to make substantial profits in the form or excise taxes.  Perhaps that’s why Liggett received such favorable terms in their “settlement.” Behind the media hoopla, here are the facts:  ¢ A $25 million dollar payout. But only if Liggett is acquired or acquires another tobacco company. Translation: nothing.  e A 25% payment from their profits. Liggett isn’t making a profit. Translation: nothing.  We continue to believe that as a matter of law, the states’ Medicaid lawsuits are fundamentally flawed.  Attorney General Grant Woods of Arizona may have said it best a few months before he decided to hop on the politically correct bandwagon.  In May 1996, the Arizona Business Gazette reported that Attorney General Woods said he “never liked the idea of filing suit against tobacco companies...such litigation made little sense, particularly since smoking is a voluntary habit and cigarettes are  legal...After all, if cigarette manufacturers could be sued for the detrimental health effects of their products, why not the people who manufacture and sell alcohol? Or even red meat?”  He was right then. He remains right today.  And what do other lawyers in this litigation think of this “settlement?” Stanley Rosenblatt, a Miami lawyer handling two cigarette class-action suits in Florida, who -- when he learned of the class action filed against and with the concurrence of Liggett -- told the New York Times: “This is a phony gimmick designed to enrich a bunch of plaintiffs’ lawyers.” Rosenblatt told the Miami Herald, “I have to take a deep breath to avoid cursing... This attempted settlement is a disgrace.”  Ht  9@SS bZSTsS __label__Report

Among the presentations made at that time were several by members of the University faculty and Experiment Station staff, who provided a very considerabie parade of taient. I especially remember being impressed by the potentials for modifying the chemical and physical properties of tobacco by means of genetic manipulations, —- variations in cultural conditions, and by alterations in processing methods. The repetitive plea of these scientists was, “If the investiga- tors of health problems can tell us how they want tobacco altered to make it ‘safer’ for smoking in the form of cigarettes; we are quite confident of being able to accomplish the changes desixed.” ~  There was, however, no answer given to this question. The -  geneticists, biochemists. agronomists, and processing experts were compelled to retire without having been given any clear health-related goals toward which to target their investigations.  uae The inability of health researchers at that time, to provide such  ' goals, did not, of course, stop all progress.

WHY YOUNG PEOPLE BEGIN SMOKING  nti-smoking advocates and government  researchers have long acknowledged  that family and peers are the primary influences on smoking by young people. The Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development before Congress put it simply: “The most forceful determinants of smoking [by young people] are parents, peers and older siblings.”  These influences, unlike the asserted influence of cigarette advertising, have been shown to be  both powerful and direct.  Anational study published by the federal government in 1992 reports, “The smoking practices of older brothers or sisters living at home were more closely associated with teenager smoking than was parental smoking. Thirty percent of adolescents reported currently smoking in homes where only older siblings smoked, compared with 15 percent of teenagers from homes where only their parents smoked.”  “As expected, the smoking patterns for both teenage boys and girls were highly correlated with the smoking practices of their closest friends. Teenagers with no best friends of the same sex who smoked, seldom smoked (about 3 percent). However, almost half of adolescents with at least two best friends who smoked were smokers themselves,” the report said.  A four-country survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) further provides support for the influences of peers and family as the most forceful determinants of youth smoking. The WHO study, published in 1986, reported:        “Studies of why people start smoking identify the influences of parents, siblings, and friends as the most important causal factors.”  THE PRESIDENTS COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS        “When young people start smoking, the most important predictor is the smoking behavior and smoking-related  oe  activities of ‘significant others’.  “The strongest statistical relationships are found with the smoking habits of the best friend.”  The survey also found that smoking among school children is “strongly related to the number of smokers in the family.”  Peers and family members have been repeatedly demonstrated to play a key role in smoking by young people. Cigarette advertising, on the other hand, has not.  Advertising was listed by one percent of respon- dents in 1991 — and not listed at all in 1993 — in a Gallup survey as the principle influence on the decision to smoke. Peer pressure and family influence were cited by almost three-quarters of respondents as the major factors.  (continued on back)  TI1354-0621 __label__Report

SLevrillard  MEMORANDUM September 24, 1993 TO: W. R. Deaton FROM: E. F. DeLaura RE: Panel Results: Harley Lights 100 MM R&D #1385-6/93  Attached are the Low Tar panel results for The Harley Lights V 1OOMM proto.  Results for the previously reported Harley Lights V 85 MM and the Regular brand are also shown as a source of  reference.  Just to note, the Regular brand testing in which these Low Tar NM panel members tested their own brand blinded, will serve as benchmark data in this and subsequent/panel memos.  The Regular brand results represent the "ideal ratings" as most respondents were extremely favorable in their  evaluations for their regular brand (in test).  Product Specs are as follows:  Harley Lts. 100 MM 9.8 mgs. tar -71 mgs. nic. Harley Lts. 85 MM 8.5 mgs. tar .66 mgs. nic. Conclusions  The Harley Lts. 100 MM proto (1385-6-93) attained an average acceptance of 6.5 among total respondents. While the product scored well among 100 MM and smokers 30 years of age and over, it netted out poorly with the 85 MM smokers and  those 18 to 29 years of age.  The 85 MM proto (1592/93-93) fared better in total, 6.8, and among all sub groups. Of note is how the 18-29 year old smokers rated all three products the lowest of all the  sub-groups. (See Table 1)  Product Performance Total Smokers  The key problem with Harley Lts. 100 MM is its "too light/not strong enough" taste. It was not cited as overly harsh tasting or having an unpleasant aftertaste.  (See Table 2) __label__Memo

Dear Dr. Eng:  Thank you for your interest in our program of research support. I am pleased to enclose our Statement of Policy, Information for Applicants and a recent Annual Report that lists currently supported grants and contains abstracts.of papers that have appeared over the last year acknowledging support from The Council for Tobacco Research.  Our two-step application process is described on a separate enclosed sheet; it addresses several topics including eligibility, funding levels, award duration and specific ‘ instructions for submitting a Preliminary Application. Each application is reviewed by . members of our Scientific Advisory Board, a panel of established biomedical scientists  who serve as our peer review committee.  Briefly, applicants must be faculty level scientists having appointments at not-for-profit institutions. The Council supports independent investigator-initiated projects (one, two or three years) in a variety of biomedical research areas. In the event you receive an award, annual, non-competing renewal applications are required and continued funding is based on your progress and the materials you submit with the renewal request forms.  The Council encourages proposals from younger researchers, but as you will see from the Annual Report, a number of our awardees are established scientists. Complete scientific freedom is assured and our only expectation is publication of research results in appropriate peer-reviewed journals.  Sincerely, rm.  cel  i . hey Ve teh a  Arthur D.

It has been shown that in rats. a systemic administration of kainate induces apoptotic cell death in various brain regions. Jn this study, we assayed the extent of brain injury after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 mg/kg kainate to rats, using the quantitative TUNEL technique and Nissl staining We examined the role of melatonin on kainate-induced brain injury by (a) injecting melatonin (4 x 2.5 mg/kg ip.) prior to and after kainate injection and (b) injecting kainate at the time of low circulating melatonin levels (day/light), and high melatonin levels (night/dark). The extent of kainate-triggered DNA damage and the loss of Niss! staining were lower in animals treated with melatonin, or when kainate was injected at night, i.e. in the presence of high endogenous levels of melatonin. Our results suggest that both the pharmacological use of melatonin and the circadian secretion of endogenous melatonin during the night may reduce the extent of excitotoxic brain injury. Further studies are needed 1o fully characterize the relevance of our findings for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative processes which involve excitotoxicity and apoptotic neuronal! death.

The latter effect of melatonin may include the scavenging of free radicals  The pineal hormone melatonin is synthesized from {12,22], the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase {20}, the serotonin by an initial N-acetylation, a rate limiting quenching of singlet oxygen [5] and the stimulation of step in melatonin synthesis which is catalyzed by the glutathione peroxidase [1]. The antioxidative action of  melatonin has been proposed as a putative endogenous neuroprotective mechanism [22].  Direct evidence of the neuroprotective action of melatonin has been found in experiments with primary neuronal cultures; it has been shown that mclatonin reduces the excitotoxic action of the glutamate receptor agonist kainate [10]. In vivo, melatonin reduced the extent of kainate-triggered brain damage [11]. A possi- ble mechanism of protection against kainate ncuroloxt- city may include the melatonin-provided prevention of kainate-triggered lipid peroxidation [16]. In vivo, kainate, which triggers convulsions and brain damage,  enzyme serotonin \V-acetyltransferase. In the rat pineal gland, the night-to-day ratio of serotonin N-acetyl- transferase mRNA content is more than 150 [3,6]. Thus, it appears that in the rat, both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in the increase of melatonin levels during the night (for re- view, see (21}).  In the brain, the biological action of melatonin may involve specific G-protein-coupled membrane receptors {24}, nuclear melatonin receptors [2] and the antioxida-     * Corresponding author.

ANETHOLE  TOXICITY PROFILE  Anethole (B71) is a naturally occurring compound found in oils of aniseed, star-anise, fennel and leaves of Clausena anisata (Opdyke, 1973).  REGULATORY STATUS  FEMA GRAS  FDA GRAS  HUNTER LIST (Not to exceed 0.15% in cigarette, cigar or hand- rolling tobacco; and 0.5% in pipe tobacco)  JECFA (ADI 0 - 0.6 mg/kg for man)  COUNCIL OF EUROPE (ADI 1.5 mg/kg trans-anethole)  METABOLISM .  Human studies indicate that anethole is excreted largely in the urine (Caldwell and Sutton, 1988, Le Bourhis, 1973, and Sangster et al., 1987). A 500 mg oral dose was excreted as hydroxybenzoic acid (5%) and methoxybenzoic acid (52%), while a 1 g oral dose did not yield detectable blood levels of anethole (Le Bourhis, 1973). A major portion of a 1 mg dose administered to two human subjects was excreted in the urine as 4-methoxyhippuric acid (Sangster et al., 1987).  In another study, human volunteers given an oral dose range of 1 - 250 mg (~0.01 - 5 mg/kg) trans-anethole exhibited metabolic patterns similar to those seen in high-dose rodent studies. 4-Methoxyhippuric acid was the major metabolite and the majority of the dose was eliminated within 8 hours (Caldwell and Sutton, 1988). In mice and rats, [methoxy-**C] anethole is extensively metabolized by o-demethylation and oxidative transformation of the three-carbon side chain, yielding a variety of products (Sangster et al., 1984a).  Reed and Caldwell (1992) report that trans-Anethole exhibited a modest enzyme inducing effect in female Charles River SD-CD rats following administration of either 300 mg/kg/day trans-anethole for 7 days or 0%, 0.25%, and 1.0% in diet for 21 days. Appropriate vehicle and positive controls were included for both assays. Anethole did not appear to be a potent, broad-spectrum inducer of hepatic enzyme activity in a screening study in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice (unpubl).  E6ESLILS __label__Scientific

Aiken United States Senate Washington, D. C.  Dear Senator Aiken:  I hope you had a chance to read this statement which we published in several newspapers the first of this month.  We mean what we say about our commitment to honest scientific research to help answer the questions about  tobacco, and would welcome your opinions. I can assure you that no amount of carelessness about the facts, for which some of the anti-tobacco forces are responsible,  is going to put us off course in seeking the truth, which is the only way to resolve the continuing smoking and health controversy.  We hope that our industry's voluntary discontinuation of broadcast cigarette advertising, as formalized by the Congress to be effective January 2, will help to provide a climate beginning in 1971 for the kind of objective approach to the tobacco question which the public  deserves.

PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: - Mr. T. M. Howell Date: September 5, 1989 Fron: . J. M. Dobbs of BF ; _. Subject: . Justification for PVT System.  I recommend that a Ruska Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium System be purchased so that we can perform, among others, the following experiments.  (1) Determination of tobacco “solubles" - CO, equilibrium. With this apparatus we will be able to isolate solubilized tobacco components which condense from CO, during depressurization. Collection and analysis of the solubles in the CO, phase will yield phase equilibrium properties between the precipitate and the tobacco matrix.  (2) CO, - Nicotine equilibrium —_ a oe oe - This system will be used to measure the equilibrium properties of this mixture beyond the present lower pressure data. The effect of pressure and temperature on the activity of nicotine in CO, can be determined from these experiments.  (3) Solubility measurements above the current 4000 psi limitation to 10,000 psi. . ae a Presently we do not have any equipment to test Gahr’s patented concept of using N, and CO, mixtures to selectively extract nicotine from tobacco. This system could be used to further test the feasibility of this concept.  The Ruska PVT system is a mercury free variable volume system with a working pressure of 10,000 psi. The heart of the apparatus is two independently operated variable volume cells with a capacity of 400 and 600 ml. Each cell is equipped with an internal magnetic stirrer and a view port. Safety considerations built into the system include a safety blow-out panel in the rear door and a sapphire window oriented away from the operator. This system will be located on the North wall of D-201 adjacent to the one-liter system and will not involve major modifications to the laboratory. The total cost of this system is $137,415. Quoted delivery is 5-6 months after receipt of order although Ruska has said this can be reduced. Attached is a  quotation from Ruska and more detailed specification information.  This project was included in the 1989 Second Revised Capital Forecast for  $90,000, and it was included in the 98271993 Five-Year Plan. 1939  cc: J. F,. Whidby  60E2OL2.502 __label__Memo

PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A.  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: R.N. Ferguson, H. Alonso, P.N. Gauvin Date: November 28, 1988 From:S.D. Baldwin, R.M. Rogers, W.A. Geiszler  Subject: Philip Morris USA’s Needs in Paper Technology. db.     A number of important issues facing Philip Morris can be addressed in large part by means of paper technology. Sidestream smoke reduction, altered mass burn rate, spotting (both in ART and non-ART products), new products and paper breakage during manufacturing all reflect current needs which can be met via modification of the wrapper material itself. Future needs might include the requirement for an exceptionally strong and flexible paper, as cigarette-maker speeds advance to 10,000 units per minute, and pexzhaps ultimately to 12,000 units per minute. Aliso, innovative new products: have requirements for very unusual papers.  In the area of sidestream smoke reduction, for example, modification of  ' the cigarette wrapper has produced very good results. Low porosity papers  and those with very fine particle size inorganic fillers have been successfully used as a: means of reducing sidestream smoke. R&D is currently evaluating materials. with diffierent chemical and physical properties. from those used for roptine papermgking. Extremely high surface area calcium carbonate (72 m'/g vs. 7m /g for normal paper and 22 m‘/g for “standard"  sidestream-reduction paper) has been obtained and is being tested. Initial results are encounaging. Materials with different chemistries, such as magnesium carbonate, have been tested with some initial sucéess. A variety  of mineral paper fillers will also be evaluated, along with several novel synthetic inorganic. compounds to be prepared by A. Kallianos and others within and outside of R&D. Physical and chemical characteriza@ion of papermaking materials will also be performed, so that we can determine why we observe what we do and to gain insight into the mechanisms involived'’,?.  Aliternate paper constructions are aliso being developed in the sidestream program in order to obtain the optimum product with respect to  - both performance and subjective characteristics. Double-wrapping,  laminating of sheets and preparing a layered or gradient sheet all are techniques. which can give us: greater flexibility in addressing a number of  problems. Different materials. can be placed in two sheets or in different strata of the same sheet. B. Goodman has. recently prepared double wrapped cigarettes for the reduction of sidestream smoke*. The outer wrap contained  the generally unpalatable Mg (OH) 5 paper and the inner wrap contained a low porosity, low calcium carbonate sheet. Results have been quite favorable in  ~both sidestream smoke reduction and subjective acceptability. This example  illustrates how the dual construction of the wrapper can ofifer a     Test taszoz __label__Memo

a  November 9, 1987  Mr. John Dean  Group Manager/Operations Group R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company 401 North Main Street Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102  Dear Mr. Dean:  For the past seven years I have run a successful sampling program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company aimed at up-scale adult audiences in Manhattan and Long Islands' finest hotels  and clubs.  I was informed today that the hotel sampling program will not be continued for 1988 and was concerned that perhaps it was mistakenly included when programs which could be criticized for possible exposure to teenagers were eliminated. There have been recent competitive developments which lead me to believe the competition is increasing their emphasis on New York hotel sampling. And the painful truth is that should  we drop our affiliation with these hotels it may be impossible to regain them should Reynolds' change its direction in the future. This hotel sampling program would be an ideal vehicle for the launch of the new smokeless cigarette we plan for 1988.  The best reason for keeping the program is the cost. This year we will distribute 750,000 sample packs at a total cost of $153,900  or nineteen-cents a pack, not including the cost of product. This successful promotion in the most coveted of marketplaces  has far-reaching sales potential.  Our major competitor in the hotel sampling program is Philip Morris who has held this program on-line since 1970. We consistently run into their samplers at a number of properties that we sample, as Philip Morris has involvement with a number of affiliations here  in this important market. Indeed we have held a preemptive position  versus the competition because we sample seven days a week.  Yesterday, for the first time, we encountered Lorillard at the Sheraton-Center Hotel sampling "Newports" at the International  Hospitality Ball.  9E8O0 GELOG  - «cont'd __label__Letter

1) Synopsis of Current Research: There are many drugs of abuse, each of which has a distinctive pharmacology. For example,  stimulant drugs (e.g., amphetamine and caffeine) and depressant drugs (e.g., alcohol and barbiturates) differ in their subjective effects, but both types of drugs are abused. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that certain brain areas play relatively more important roles in the development and maintenance of behaviors related to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Two important pathways are the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways, which emerge from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA). Projection of the neurons of the VTA to the nucleus accumbens (mesolimbic) and to the prefrontal cortex (mesocoitical) appear to be important for the expression of the rewarding properties of a wide variety of drugs of abuse. Most drugs of abuse increase neurotransmission through the mesolimbic-mesocortical sytems, either by increasing activity of VTA neurons (e.g., nicotine, opiates, ethanol) or by augmenting the release of dopamine in the terminal areas (e.g., cocaine and amphetamine). Because the VTA is one important area for the mediation of drug-induced reward, the study of how various abused substances affect neurons of the VTA is a critical for the treatment of addiction.  The overall goal of my research is to develop a better understanding of the physiology and pharmacology of central reward systems. In order to approach this goal, I have developed a brain slice preparation of the VTA suitable for intra- and extracellular recording. Putative dopamine- containing neurons of the mesencephalon have been well characterized electrophysiologically in vivo; neurons in the brain slice appear similar to neurons studied in vivo. VTA neurons fire spontaneously in a slow (0.5 - 5 Hz), regular pattern. We have examined the effects of several drugs of abuse on this spontaneous activity. Among the agents we have examined are cocaine (Brodie and Dunwiddie, 1990) and ethyl alcohol (Brodie, et al., 1990). We are continuing our study of ethanol, by using intracellular recording in an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of ethanol-induced excitation of VTA neurons. Ethanol appears to cause a slight depolarization, a decrease in the action potential amplitude, and a decrease in the amplitude of the afterhyperpolarization (Brodie and Shefner, 1989). Further experiments are planned to determine whether any of these effects underlies the ethanol-induced excitation of VIA neurons.  We have also investigated the effects of nicotine on the spontaneous activity of VTA neurons (Brodie, 1991). Nicotine excites VTA neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. VTA neurons possess an EC50 for nicotine-induced excitation of about 250 nM; therefore, VIA neurons are more sensitive to the excitatory effects of nicotine than many other central neurons. Furthermore, little desensitization to the effects of nicotine are seen at lower concentrations (less than 1 pM) (Brodie, 1991). The response of VTA neurons to nicotine is blocked by hexamethonium or mecamylamine. VTA neurons also possess pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Brodie and Mueller, 1988; Lacey, et al, 1988), so studies of nicotinic cholinergic receptors must be performed with specific nicotinic agonists, and/or in the presence of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists. With our preparation, a full range of concentrations of nicotine can be applied to the same VTA neuron, which would permit a more precise characterization of the specific receptor subtype involved in mediating nicotine-induced excitation of VTA neurons.  2) Research Plan and Goals of Proposed Research Molecular biologists have identified a number of different subtypes of the nicotinic  cholinergic receptor. It is known that the nicotinic cholinergic receptor is a pentamer formed from 4 subunits: 2 « subunits, and one each of B, y (or e) and 8. Recent studies from a number of laboratories indicate that pharmacological specificity is conferred by the « and B subunits. Five forms of the « subunit («2 - #6) and four forms of the B subunit (B2 - 65) are found in rat brain. Different combinations of the various forms of these subunits constitute functionally different  1 __label__Scientific

November 5, 1996  A Review of:  Denissenko, M.F., Pac, A., Tang, M., and Pfeifer, G.P. Preferential Formation of Benzofa}jpyrene Adducts at Lung Cancer Mutational Hotspots in P53. (1996) Science 274, 430-432.  by J. D. Heck, R. S. Lake, and R. DB. Leverette  The journal Science published in its October 18 issue a study by Mikhail Denissenkc and colleagues which describes DNA adduct patterns in the P53 gene of cultured cells exposed to benzoflalpyrene diol epoxide (BDPE}. The most frequent sites for this in vitro adduct formation were compared to a previously- published database which has inventoried the sites of mutation in the P53 gene of human tumors. Publication of the paper was accompanied by a flurry of reports in the print and broadcast news media which grossly overinterpreted the actual findings of the investigators. The following statement is based on our own review of the paper and briefly references a substantial and well-founded bedy of prior work in the field which supports a very different perspective on the biological significance of benzo({alpyrene (B[alP} in cigarette smoke.  The P53 gene and cancer  The P53 gene’s ultimate product is a protein which normally acts as a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of other genes involved in a variety of fundamental cell functions, including cell growth control, DNA repair, and the initiation of apoptosis {programmed cell death). P53 is a highly conserved gene which has been identified in many species. It is also the human gene most frequently identified as being altered by matation in.a variety of human cancers, with mutations having been identified.at the majority of P53's 393 codons (2 DNA muclectide coding units which specify individual amino acids of the P52 protein}. Over 50% of human tumors analyzed to date from various sites, including the lung, have been found to have P53 mutations. However, the fact that many human and experimental animal tumors do not appear to have detectable P53 mutations indicates thet such mutations are not a mandatory step in the incompletely-understood process of carcinogenesis.  The experiments of Denissenko eb al, Denissenko and coworkers describe experiments in which syntheticaily-prepared BPDE, which is thought to be a DNA-  reactive mammalian metabolic product of Bfa]P, was chserved to  4  OL9 7068 __label__Scientific

Views expressed at the press conference at Folkets Hus,  June 18, 1979, Fourth World Conference on Smoking and Health     General: approx. 30 journalists, of which about 15 participated in their capacity as delegates from foreign organisations.  The press conference was a resumé of the morning presentations and questions related to these presentations. A great number  of the questions dealt with:  ~ the resources of information of the tobacco industry vs  official institutions  ~ the tobacco growing countries' economical profit from tobacco - health questions and their social consequences ” legislation or not  ~ ecological factors  -~ the responsibility of politicians  - the situation in Scandinavia ,  The conference was held in a room that was too small. There were  no micorphones or loudspeakers, and both questions and answers  were hard to distinguish in the rather noisy audience.  Examples of points of views that were put forth -- naturally  ‘mainly against smoking and growing of tobacco:  -— The social insight about the damaging effects of smoking  accelerates quickly, primarily in the industrialized countries.  ~ Increasing consideration is given to the non-smokers, who  increase in number and consequently dare claim more consideration.  - Smoking is a kind of suicide and therefore the scientific  research has to consider its work relative to suicide.     - Legislation against smoking was not recommended. However,  local regulations should be made possible to prohibit smoking  in public places.  wl Qo 2 ND “I nN ec: n  a  -=- The economical advantage of the industry when it comes to information on smoking and its consequences is enormous. | In this respect, politicians should take greater responsibility.

Previous studies have examined the effect of total removal of particulate matter and include Irritation Tests 1,2,3 and & (report on Irritation Test 6 will be forthcomming).  METHODS  Testing was similar to that reported by Gayle Ryan in SED Test Report No. API.  CAMEL LIGHT 85's were chosen on the basis of draft (12.2 to 13.4 cm H20) and % air dilution (27% to 34%), Product manipulation was as follows:  + 92.5% WIPM - filter holder without filter  » SS.5% WPM ~ filter with two fat short tubes.  34.6% WIPM - filter with one fat short tube.  17.5% WIPM - filter with one long skinny tube.  15.5% WIPM - filter with no dilution tubes.  MmooODD>  The filter holder was placed directly above the smoking chamber with  the aid of a Delryn connector. A similar connector was placed on top of the filter holder to which a Teflon Tee was attached. Also to this were the dilution air and the exit tube to the soliniod box.  The method for callibrating the filter pads is described in Appendix a.  fs in prior tests Gayle Ryan was responsible for subject performance evaluations and statistical analysis. Ruth Webb and Saundra Jacobs shared the responsibilities for arranging test schedules, running the  test and data entry  Evaluations were performed on 9 sensory attributes (attachment 1) using unstructured line scales (attachment 2).

The database however, is not able fo handie the default you are requesting.

Thus, we would not recommend changing the survey until after this point in time.  In regards to your second question concerning the Regular Brand Question. The suppliers are currently set up to capture any extra information given in the Regular Brand quesiion that pertains to questions 2-5 on the current survey. That is, if only the Regular Brand question is asked and an Adult Smoker answers Marlboro Lights, then the data entry supplier captures Marlboro for the brand and populates Lights for the Tar Level. If we split out Lights and Milds then a response of Marlboro Milds to the Regular Brand Question would be captured as Mariboro for the brand,and Milds for the Tar Level.  {n the short term, we could request that a response of Milds be captured as a medium. Thig would be a training issue for the suppliers versus a programming/database issue.

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Date: October 11, 1990  The attached procedures have been developed for the inventory and maintenance of records for your functional area. The procedures have been reviewed and endorsed by the Records Management Joint Task Force, the Philip Morris USA Legal  Department, and the law firm of Hunton and Williams. The implementation of these procedures is dependent upon the Records Management Inventory System being  fully operational. According to the Information Services Department, the system will be fully operational by December 31, 1990.  The procedures are in compliance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual with one exception. The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual states that Disposal Notices are signed by functional heads, whereas these procedures indicate that Disposal Notices are signed by department managers.  The Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual will be revised to indicate that  this is the responsibility of department managers.  It has been recommended to the Records Management Joint Task Force that these procedures be included in the Philip Morris USA Records Management Manual as an  appendix, and a decision on this matter is pending.  These procedures should prove to be highly beneficial in assuring that your department's records are managed in accordance with the Philip Morris USA Records Management Program, and it is anticipated that you will realize greater efficiency in managing records upon implementation of these procedures.

Jordan, attached please find two files now in agreement:  1) 2001 Budget (all charts issued monthly via Bozell) 2) TRAC0901 (monthly tracker from Weber Shandwick)  Per Sheldon's question, the correct PR budget is $1,266,400 with Fees of $577,500 and OOP Expenses of $688,000.  The discrepancy stemmed from the $25,400 transfered from PR to Advertising to fund an incremental page in family Life, supporting the Popkin Tour. This adjustment had not yet been reflected in the WS tracker and was mis-allocated on the Bozell chart. The charts are now in agreement.  Please don't hesitate to contact us with any further questions.  Many thanks, Adam  jbressler@lortobco.com wrote:  Just need a quick answer on this.

While Marlboro did have some paints at key access roads, they had no 30-sheet showing at all. This may be in part due to the fact that they frequently alternate showings with Benson & Hedges and it was not their month to be up.  Our paints had good locations andin combination with our 30 sheet showing gave us great impact in the market.  Two other brands, Old Gold Box and Lark also had significant showings in the market (both 30-sheet & paints), while Pall Mall Gold, Benson & Hedges, Kent and L&M had "minor" showings.  CONCLUS IONS  While Marlboro did not appear to be a significant factor in the O-O-H medium at this particular point in time, they nonetheless enjoy almost a 23% share of market vs our 13.7. Because they are doing so well in this market, they may have diverted funds into other less developed areas. If we could in- crease the length of our 30-sheet showing from 6 to 12 months, we might be able to increase our share in ‘this traditionally strong Marlboro market.  -  SoeS CLO0S __label__Report

College of Physicians & Surgeons of Columbia Univers: | New York, N.Y. 10032  DEPARTMENT OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY 630 West 168th Street  Radiological Research Laboratories  (212) 305-9930     Dec 6, 1988  U  By wb.  Dear Dr. Stone,  The Radiation Research Society is holding its thirty-seventh annual meeting in Seattle, on March 18-23, 1988. The Society is by far the biggest of its type in the world, and typically has more than 1000 participants at the annual meeting. One of the sessions, which I have been asked to organise, is a Workshop on “The Interaction Between Radon Exposure and Smoking." A brief description of the workshop, and the participants, is enclosed, the former to be included in the conference program book. In light of our phone conversation, it would be most helpful and extremely appropriate if the Council for Tobacco Research could sponsor the seminar, in terms of a contribution of, say, $2500, towards the travel expenses of the participants. An appropriate acknowledgement vould, of course, appear in the conference program.  Closer to home, our own laboratory has been doing a considerable amount of research into the biological effects of radon in vitro, and is planning to do some experiments with alpha particles simulating radon daughters and with tobacco smoke condensate, to look for possible synergistic interactions - which would imply that the hazard of radon + smoking is larger than the sum of the hazards from radon alone and smoking alone. Our end point will be in-vitro oncogenic transformation. As our experience with tobacco smoke condensate is limited, would you be interested in coming to give us a seminar - or a more informal discussion - on tobacco research in general? Our laboratory has a seminar series, and a small honorarium is usual.  I enclose our laboratory annual report, and my own ©.V., to give you a feel for the scope of our activities.

T SELLS HUGE amounts of food and huge amounts of beer.  But in the eyes of the financial  community and consumers, New York-  based Philip Morris Cos. Inc. remains  much of what it has been for more than  a century: a seller of cigarettes, And despite a recent court ruling ina  vamoking-liability case that cast a pall over the tobacco industry, company ex-  ecutives say they remain committed to |  : )  |  carrying on the business that has been °  their main trade for 141 years.  “We're completely committed to cigarettes. It’s been a terrific businesa for us,” Hamish Maxwell, chairman of the board and chief executive of Philip Morris, said in a telephone interview last week.  Such sentiments may seem surpris-. ing, given the federal jury verdict in Newark Monday, For the firat time, a tobacco company — Liggett Group Ine. ~- lost a smoking-liability suit. A jury awarded $400,000 to Antonio Cipallone,,  e widower of Rose Cipollone; who died  stun Se ae oat a of cigarettes a or 40 yeurs, Pephilip Morris also was a defendant, but was exonerated.  Some believe that now that one anti- smoking suit has succeeded, Philip Mor- ria, the nation’s largest cigarctte manu- fa:turer and a company facing about 50 other smoking-liability cases, stands & greater chance of losing in the future.  "It doesn’t have to be a landmark decision by a jury anymore,” said Pav- los AJexandrakis, a consumer-goods an- alyst for Argus Research Corp. in New York.  ot everyone agrees.  John Maxwell (no relation to the Philip Morris chairman), who follows the tobacco industry for Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond, Va., noted that Cipollone lawyers spent $2 million preparing for a case that brought in a fifth of that amount in the jury verdict. “You don’t have to be a CPA to work out that. . , that's not a very good in- vestment,” he said.

Aword to nonsmokers  (about working together)  Wherever you work — even if you're a billboard painter — you work with smokers,and always have.  There's nothing remarkable about that. Forty percent of the people around you are smokers, and 60% are nonsmokers. Still, we work, live, and enjoy ourselves together.  Lately, however, we've all become super-sensitive to each other and to each other’s privileges and obligations. And that’s not a bad thing.  We agree on many things. There are places (crowded elevators, to take the simplest example) where smoking is not appropriate. In closed and private places, the ancient courtesy of “Do you mind if I smoke?” is still the best rule. Smokers, we believe, have become more generally conscious of that courtesy. The occasional careless smoker, waving a lighted cigarette or cigar, should, in our opinion, be as quickly reminded of others’ preferences by a thoughtful smoker as by a nonsmoker.  Nevertheless there are some people— anti-smokers rather than nonsmokers — who will never be satisfied with our sensible accommodations to each other. They don’t  want us to work together at all. Instead they5 ==     want to segfegate us by law — literally to  build walls between us -—- at considerable expense to both smokers and nonsmokers — in places where we work, shop, eat or just go to amuse ourselves.  We know that such anti-smokers do not represent the great majority of nonsmokers. And the anti-smokers know it, too. But there is a danger that others will think they do.  “When I went to the legislature,” says one anti-smoking lobbyist, “they thought I had about 10,000 people behind me. That was a laugh. It was just me. I had the law passed by myself”  If it is a “laugh” for the anti-smoker, it is no joke for the rest of us for we must all, smokers and nonsmokers alike, pay the cost of such foolish laws. All of us are losers when any one of us is denied freedom of choice.  We don’t think that, over the long run, that’s going to happen. We think that, like our billboard painters, we'll go on working together until we get the job done.  THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE 1776 K St. NW., Washington. D.C. 20006  Freedom of choice is the best choice.  =>  VA __label__Advertisement

LONG-PATH INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY FOR AIR POLLUTION RESEARCH  E. R. STEPHENS*  Franklin Institute Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  (Received 30 September 1960)  Abstract—Two long-path absorption cells have been designed and built for the measurement of gaseous contaminants in the atmosphere and for the laboratory study of reactions occurring in such atmospheres. These instruments are based on the White multiple-reflection system, having two large mirrors of 3 m radius of curvature at one end of the cell and a smaller mirror  of the same radius at the other end. To avoid excessive losses of radiant energy, the image of the infrared source is magnified and  demagnified to match the cell to the spectrometer. Optimum path for maximum absorption signal is reached when reflection losses reduce the energy to i/e of its initial value. This cor- responds to a path length of 120 m with the present cells although they have been successfully used at paths several times this length. It is possible to detect and identify many contaminants of importance in air pollution at concentrations of a few tenths of a part per million. The absorptions of water vapor and carbon dioxide make some regions of the spectrum opaque,  but this interference is not serious over most of the spectrum. The first of these cells was used for laboratory studies in Philadelphia and the second was mounted in a laboratory trailer and taken to southern California where it has been in use  since 1956 for the study of the atmosphere and related problems.  ONE of the most serious problems encountered in air pollution research is that of obtaining adequate analytical methods. Often one must try to analyze a complex mixture whose composition can only be guessed and in which the components of interest are present in very minute amounts. Chemical methods applied to such a problem suffer from the short- coming that serious interferences may be caused by components whose presence is not only unknown but unsuspected. An example of this is the potassium iodide method used to measure “oxidant” in the Los Angeles atmosphere. Although most of the so-called “oxi- dant” is believed to be ozone, the question of how much of it might be other oxidizing agents is still unresolved.  To meet the need for more specific analytical methods for the many substances of interest in air pollution. the Franklin Institute Laboratories have been developing the technique of long-path infrared absorption spectroscopy.  The primary interest in this work, which is sponsored by the Smoke and Fumes Com- mittee of the American Petroleum Institute, has always been the chemistry of air pollution rather than optics, spectroscopy, or analytical methods per se. For this reason, previous publications") have emphasized the results of reaction studies and described only superficially the instrumentation used. This paper is written in the belief that more details  of the long-path infrared technique may be of interest.  * Now with Scart Research Laboratories, P.O.

MURRAY ALAN KATZ 409 TULANE DRIVE, N. E, ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO  August lh, 1962.  Director of Research Phillip Morris, Inc. 100 Park Avenue  New York 17, N. Y.  Dear Sirs  At the present time I am engaged in the Maytag Research Project at the Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque. The research, which is carried out under strict medical supervision, is designed to relate some 110 events with pulmonary function data of unselected, healthy  and diseased individuals, The data are correlated with subsequent yearly testing on these patients,  From past work on animals and humans it has been found that those individuals with lung disease and/or cancer frequently differ from the norm by the presence of an atyoical protein moiety. The failure to establish a specific protein in every case is principally due, I be- lieve, to the lack of refined technique; for it appears that patients with bronchospastic syndromes have a definite biochemical predtléction to these conditions; and this factor may well be a protein. If one were able, through refinement of existing methods, to obtain statis= tical evidence for the existence of such a diagnostic protein and dem onstrate that these individuals having it show abnormal findings in the battery of tests from the Maytag Project, it would appear thatthe  alleged carcinogenic and irritative effects of tobacco may be purely coincidental and not etiological,  Thinking a subject such as this would be of great interest to You, I should like to apply to you for a grant to conduct a research program to test my thesis, The best technique for such a project is starch- gel-electrophoresis, The obvious advantage of this zonal method over the free-boundary one is that the former affords easy isolation of the protein substance, whereas this is impossible in the latter case, Mores  over, of the two types of zonal analysis » the starch-gel method offers better resolution than the paer technique, “  Inasmich as the Maytag Project data are rapidly growing, and the need for an additional program such as I have described is increasing, a prompt reply would be appreciated, ‘  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Hayes NO. 4 : DATE: November 16, 1988  SUBJECT: Review of Research Suggestions from James Crapo  The following is a review of the research suggestions made by Dr. James Crapo. This review has been developed in collaboration  with A. Mosberg and C. Coggins:  I. Evaluation of Cardiovascular Effects 1. Vascular Reactivity of the Coronary Circulation  Determine acute coronary vasculature spasm in models such as dogs, primates and possibly man produced by reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette smoke and nicotine.  2. Vascular Reactivity of the Cerebral Circulation  Changes in cerebral circulation can be determined by near infrared spectroscopy using animal models such as the cat and baboon and possibly man. The effect of reference cigarette smoke, new cigarette smoke and nicotine can be determined.  Critique  9 Dr. Crapo suggest factors such as pyrolysis products, CO and nicotine can have an effect on _ these variables. The studies as outlined do not adequately separate out which factors (if any) may produce observed effects (if any). __label__Letter

Ane  Re: WINSTON 100's "X", 16 mg Tar Unannounced Shipment Test  March 17, 1978  The purpose of this document is to outline the current status and proposed timetable for unannounced shipment test of the WINSTON 100's 16 mg product.  Background  The WINSTON 100's Improved Product program was initiated in February, 1977, when NFO results determined that the current product was less preferred to Marlboro in blind testing. Test results showed that female WINSTON 100's smokers and all Marlboro smokers preferred Marlboro 100's over WINSTON 100's. ‘The primary reason for WINSTON's lack of preference was its being perceived "too strong/harsh" "less smooth/mild" relative to Marlboro.  Accordingly, three lowered-tar blends were developed which were judged to be milder than current WINSTON 100's. It was intended that one of the products would be introduced into an "announced"  test market if it met the required action standards, which have since been modified. The new "announcement" action standards specify:  * Significant preference over current among WINSTON smokers.  -  * Significant preference over Marlboro among WINSTON smokers. (Additional element)  * parity or better vs. Marlboro among Marlboro and B&H smokers. (Same blend used in Marlboro and B&H)  * preference over Marlboro among other NFF smokers.  * preference to be maximized versus females, the primary target for the 100mm NFF category.  * TPM at 17 mgs or less.  Test Results  Blend #2 demonstrated significant advantages over current WINSTON  100's, although the blend did not fully meet the action standards  for “announcement” test market.

I'd like to try to tighten up where we stand with our subsequent coupon [and survey} print quantities and scheduie.  Taking a look at what's been printed and delivered to date, we certainly do not need the print as many coupons as originally planned for the March/April Batch (3).  FMI has received the following:  1,485,109 - Batch 1 2,343,000 - Batch 2  That's a total of 3,828,109.  3,500 stores were completed in November and December, and 4,000 stores are planned for January. I'm assuming 6,833 stores for February. With that volume of stores, | estimate that a total of 2,364,945 coupons would be needed (165 coupons per store). That would leave an overage of 1,463,164  coupons.  Assuming again that we wotild do 6,833 stores in both March and April, we'd need an additional 791,726 coupons printed to cover all stores.  I've put together a spreadsheet that may make this a little easier. What | will need from FMI is a confirmation/estimate of the number of stores you will cover per month. Obviously, that will ultimately drive the print quantities.  If we are in agreement that Batch 3 should be around 800M, that quantity should be delivered by 2/15/01 which means we'd be going to press week after next. Let's try to confirm this early next  week.  Thanks!  a  Printingassumptions 69M2.xIs  Lorew  917-663-2351 917-663-5236 FAX __label__Email

As stated in my letter to you of February 28, 1989, the Company's policy since at least 1982 is to make no payments for placement of cigarettes or cigarette advertising in films. From time to time, the Company, will provide free product and/or promotional materials (not including billboards) for a film preduction. When .thia occurs, however, it is in response to a pro- Gucer's request for cigarettes for use in a script already containing a smoking scene.  Where television is the medium, our policy is sim- ple and direct. We do not provide payments for . placement, nor do we provide free product or other promotional materials for use in television pro- grams.  TIMN 367758 __label__Letter

Ihrig , Qurer™  a“ SUBJECT: Vapor Phase Analysis on Recently Submitted Samples  The organic vapor phase, HCN, and permanent gas analysis  are complete for Fact, 4092, 4093, MAX, L. T. Brown, and Saratoga. Fact is a 85 mm cigarette being test marketed: by  Brown and Williamson. The cigarette has a specially constructed filter containing a smoke filtering resin{ probably Duolite A~-2, manufactured by Diamond Shamrock). Samples 4092 and 4093 are  the prototype of the Kent Golden Lights. The remaining samples are commercially available cigarettes. The results of this study are given in the attached table...  The only parameter that is substantially different for Fact, as compared to other 85 mm cigarettes, is HCN. The. resinous filter additive apparently removes approximately  50 percent of the HCN.  The permanent gas analysis indicates approximately 40 percent air dilution for Samples 4092 and 4093. Undoubtedly, 4092 and 4093 should have very low tar and nicotine levels.  The striking similarity in the organic vapor phase for 85 mm and 120 mm cigarettes is probably due to a fortuitous combination of circumstances, such as similar tobacco weights, longer burn time, and more air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes. The affect of air dilution for 120 mm cigarettes becomes very apparent in the comparison of CO/Ng and CO2/N2 ratios from the  permanent gas data.           M. Ihrig     “A.     Xe. Dr. -R. B.

oy BRAET  i The overall objective for the Corporation's domestic markating  i group will be to stop the erosion of the Company's market share  : and reestablish itself in the tobacco industry as a atrong and viable competitor by stabilizing established brands' share of Segment and developing and marketing new products in the mainstrean,  PB non-menthol category. To this end, the group's first priority  will be to leunch BARCLAY nationally, assuming satisfactory test  market performance. Additional new product work will continue ow  fpem other alsaiemiiee new product opportunities recognizing beth  current ultra low tar possibilities as well as new opportunities  which may occur ag a consequence of external/environmental changes. Giving first priority to the launch of a new brand in no way signals an intent to abandon an aggressive posture with respect to efforts  to minimize the erosion in volume on established brands. KOOL,  in particular, will be managed with heavy marketing resources  focusing on stabilizing the parent in its category and on finding  the competitive edge that will give the low tar styles grester  growth potential. @rne overall objective for the Corporation's eatablished brands is to produce budgeted or better volume within corporate epending and profit guidelines. tn addition, the brands must pursue an aggressive testing program to demonstrate opportunities for investing incremental funds in order to build total share of  market,  NOFICE f the £11m image to lees clear than his notice, it 46 due to the quality € che document being filmed. __label__Report

Scott  Turkey Cy - ¢  You  inquired about (1) a U.S.-Turkish bi-lateral trade  agreement signed in February, and (2) a proposal to establish a joint Economic Commission under the State Department.  l.  ec:  Attached is a Federal Register notice (50 FR 8428, March 1, 1985) announcing that the U.S. recognizes Turkey as signatory on the GATT Subsidies Code. The agreement was signed February 25, 1985. I am informed that, in order for the U.S. to recognize a country under the agreement, a bi-lateral trade agreement must be reached that would have the following results: a country (Turkey in this case) would agree to phase out export sibSsidies and in return the U.S. would entitle the country to injury tests in countervailing duty and anti-dumping regulations with the U.S. International Trade Commission. Sources at U.S. Commerce Department indicate Turkey desired the protection afforded by the  Itc injury tests and, therefore, agreed to phase out its export subsidies.  The Government of Turkey has proposed to the United States that annual economic consultations between the two countries commence this year. The U.S. is currently considering such a meeting this year only. Under Secretary of Economic Affairs for the U.S. Department of State W. Allen Wallis is tentatively scheduled to visit Turkey on June 5 and 6, 1985. No decision will be made regarding future economic meetings until the U.S. reviews the initial consultations, State Department sources say nothing exists on paper regarding the proposed economic commission at this time.  We have been asked by sources at the ITA Turkey desk at  the Commerce Department if we have any problems or points we would like to have raised at the tentative  June 5 and 6 meeting. If so, please contact me as soon as possible. I understand the agenda is wide open at  this time.  Mr. Stephen B. Bull Mr. Gene A. Knorr  Z6LEZLPL0Z __label__Memo

April 11 - 15, 1994  Problems  Most of this week has been dedicated to find a solution to an EMM386 error that’s occurring on several PC machines, mostly in the Training Room. I talked to a Microsoft engineer about this problem in great detail. He tells me the Upper Memory Blocks on the PC machines are incorrectly mapped by PC applications. He instructed me how to exclude regions of memory from being mapped. However, it did not solve the problem. I will continue to bug Microsoft.  Also, last Wednesday, a problem with the network was being affected throughout the building. I and several users were hit with dropped connections or Microsoft Mail errors. I  didn’t think to look at our sniffer to see if there was anything loading the system. If it happens again, I'll investigate the sniffer.

Nevertheless small, homogeneous, membrane-  bound, intracytoplasmic bodies measuring 25 my. appeared fairly well  _ preserved (Fig. 2).  Transplantation Studies  Aliquots of the neoplasm were inaediately placed in cell- impermeable chambers of the Millipore type (0.45 bo pore diameter), which were implanted intraperitoneally into 10 male and female Wistar rats weighing 150 - 200 gm. Two chambers were placed in each animal in such a manner as to permit their approximation to the lateral surface of the abdominal wall. A detailed account of this procedure has becit reported elsewhere.  _Laparotony was performed at 4, &, and 14 days after implantation, “at which times the contents of the chambers were transplanted to cheek pouches of adult golden hamsters of both sexes, weighing 45-60 g. Suc- cessful transplants were then passed into other hauster cheek pouches, No host-conditioning was employed. Our method of hamster cheek pouch transplantation has also been described previously, 21514  Portions of the tissue removed from the chambers, as well as the cheek pouch transplants, were fixed in either 10% neutral formalin or Zenker's acetic fluid, and sections prepared from paraffin-imbedded tissue were stained as above for light microscopy.

TRANSFORMATION  Fluorescent trpt transformants were observed following treatment. of wild-type DNA with HNO? (positive control). The B. subtilis assay system is now operational in our hands. |  Experiments were begun to measure the effects of IRI and X6D0AD (AD) whole smoke condensates (WSC's) on the activity of transforming) DNA. Preliminary results showed that both WSC's had no toxic effects on the cell's under the conditions used.  ‘Be = S. Typhimurium MUTATION  1. Liquid Culture: Replicate experiments were performed in which mutant cells were grown for 18-22 hours in the presence of different doses of IRI WSC. The results to date indicate that IRI WSC does not in- duce mutations at a significant level (>2X spontaneous) in either the base sub- stitution mutant (TA 1535) or the frame- shift mutant (TA 1538).?  2. Soft Agar Overlay (Disc. Test): Preliminary results supported the results of liquid  culture experiments- (see above). Neither IRI nor AD WSC was active in producing a  significant number of his* revertants in. the TA 1535 and TA 1538 tester strains.  C74-04164  ¥2Z820Z2202 __label__Scientific

NUH rOcaliog  Working Together to Work It Out: SO R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Promotes Peaceful Coexistence  Why Peaceful Coexistence?  In many public places, a wedge is being driven between smokers and nonsmokers. In most cases, both groups get along well. But their relationship is often misrepresented, and the conflict blown out of proportion.  In an environment where contention and intolerance prevail, it's unpleasant for both smokers and nonsmokers. So people stay at home and everyone's business suffers.  The truth is, most people want to work together to achieve a solution. In fact, most adults believe that smoking restrictions should consider the rights of both sides.  That's why R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJR) launched the Peaceful Coexistence Program in the spring of 1992. It uses a humorous approach to accomplish the serious task of building bridges instead of walls.  How Do You Achieve Peaceful Coexistence?  It's really not as difficult as it may seem. The key to generating peaceful coexistence is putting the issue in proper perspective, and encouraging smokers and nonsmokers alike to exercise tolerance, courtesy, common sense, and accommodation. After nearly three years, the program has been well-received by hospitality owners across the nation.  Why is the Peaceful Coexistence Program successful? Because...  e A March 1994 Gallup/CNN/USA Today Poll showed that 86 percent  of Americans oppose prohibition on smoking; and e more than two-thirds want separate sections, not bans.  e It makes good business sense.  Since Peaceful Coexistence benefits all of your patrons, it clearly benefits you and your business.  What is RJR Doing To Promote Peaceful Coexistence?  Through a variety of materials and informational brochures, RJR is encouraging smokers and nonsmokers alike to exercise tolerance, courtesy, common sense and accommodation. The program combines this message with the promotion of good ventilation and seeks to create the most hospitable environment possible.        9S6L 692TS __label__Report

Maselli  RE: Corporate Center of Excellence in Toxicology Weekly Highlights - Week Ending August 29, 1986  e A meeting was held with RJR Archer representatives to develop sampling schedules and strategies for ozone, toluene, isocyanate and oil mists. Employees are being exposed to these chemicals in the workplace.  e Dr. John Kirschman will publish a paper on "Investigations of dichloromethane metabolism and subchronic oral toxicity as the basis for design of chronic oral studies in rats and mice" in  the November issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology.  e An FDA. Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity to Food Constituents has recommended an increase in research efforts in the area of antigen characterization and the development of an appropriate animal model, a reporting procedure for deaths due to adverse food reactions to the Centers for Disease Control, an increase in enforcement of good manufacturing practices to prevent laws which exempt some ingredients from food labels, and an increase in educational efforts toward physicians, consumers and manufacturers regarding avoidance and treatment of food reactions. The recommendations also included the labeling of bulk foods sold in retail outlets and to limit or phase-in the release of new food additives. The committee also acknowledged the incidence of food reactions to legumes which included peanuts and soybeans, seafood (accounts for 5 to 10% of reactions in children), milk and eggs (10 to 25% of reactions in children, 0.1% in the general population), tree nuts and chocolate. The committee also noted that reactions to grain products are exceedingly rare and there is  no evidence that molds/yeasts produce adverse reactions.  ble2 697905 __label__Letter
RCN BY: RUIKT GOVT. RELATIONS 2 4e E-92 FTE OGPM oe 236 568: ~  -~  wee we  ta re re  f  Response to State Attorneys General  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. July 1, 1992  Key Points:  Q  Dr. DiFranza, a principal author of the JAMA studies, has said, “None of these studies were designed to show that these Camel ade increased smoking among kids.*  Joe Camel and Mickey Mouse were not equally recognized in the total study.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza has admitted to bias and research manipulation in his work that purports Camel hag 32% of youth smokers.  Youth smoking is on the decline in the U.S., while youth disapprovabeof smoking is increasing. -  Recognition of advertising does not translate drito usage or changed attitudes about smoking.  The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that  teen smoking can be reduced by as much as 50% through compliance with existing minimumeage laws.  Background facts:  The statement Joe Camel is as well recognized as Mickey Mouse 4s one of the most incorrect headlines in this controvarsy. The article shows that 91.7% of the 229 kids in the study recognized Mickey Mouse as the Disney logo, 51.1% recognized Joe Camel as a cigarette illustration -- a  40-point gap. The 23 6-year-olds in the study came closer to recognizing the two equally, but 23 kida in one school - are in no way representative of the entire U.S., and the ~ flawed methodology of the survey affected this result. Also, recognition does not change the negative recognition kids have about smoking.  Dr. Joseph DiFranza, the principal author of the article on Canel's share of the youth market, has admitted to the press that there is bias and manipulation in his research on Camel. The purpose of his work, ha says, was to "give us a couple of smoking guns to bring to the media." He has acknowledged that, "None of thease studies were designed to show that these Camel ada increased smoking among kida." He outlined the final article more than a year before its publication, writing a research colleague, "There, the paper 6 ail ready. Now all we need ia some data."  LOC H2STS __label__Report

Mini-Review  Plasma Membrane Protein Sorting in Polarized Epithelial Cells  Keith Mostov, Gerard Apodaca, Benjamin Aroeti, and Curtis Okamoto Departments of Anatomy, and Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Cardiovascular Research Institute, Box 0452, University of  California, San Francisco, California 94143-0452  function of most eukaryotic cells. A basic aspect of this polarity is that the cell’s plasma membrane is divided into discrete domains. Examples include the membranes of axons and dendrites in neurons, the growing bud and mating projection in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and lamel- lipodia in fibroblasts. However, the best-studied type of polarity is found in epithelia, which is the most common type of tissue in animals (52, 56). In simple epithelia the cells form a monolayer where one surface of the cell—the apical —faces the outside world or a topologically equivalent space, such as the lumen of the intestines. This is separated by tight junctions from the basolateral surface, which con- tacts adjacent cells and the underlying connective tissue. Apical and basolateral surfaces have very different protein and lipid compositions (4, 10, 57). For example, the basolateral surface contains receptors for adhering to other cells and the basement membrane, and for uptake of nutrients from the circulation. The apical surface contains transporters for exchanging small molecules with the outside world. As epithelial cells divide and differentiate they must send proteins to the correct surface to establish their polarity (25). Moreover, in a differentiated epithelial cell, polarity is maintained despite an enormous flux of membrane compo- nents traveling to and from each surface.  S PATIAL asymmetry is fundamental to the structure and  Pathways to the Cell Surface  As shown in Fig. 1, epithelial cells use two pathways to send proteins to the correct surface. Newly made proteins can travel directly from the trans-Golgi network (TGN)' to ei- ther the apical or basolateral surface. Alternatively, proteins can use an indirect pathway traveling first from the TGN to the basolateral surface, followed by endocytosis and trans- cytosis to the apical surface (46, 55). The former pathway was discovered in MDCK cells which form a well-polarized monolayer when cultured on a permeable support. In pio- neering work, Rodrigucz-Boulan and Sabatini (53) showed that influenza virus buds solely from the apical surface,     |. Abbreviations used in this paper.

Viral envelope proteins, hemagglu- tinin (HA) of influenza and G protein of VSV (VSVG), travel through the secretory pathway together to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here they are packaged into separate vesi- cles that carry these proteins to the apical and basolateral surfaces, respectively (24, 51). Newly made endogenous MDCK proteins are also delivered directly from the TGN to their final destination (33). Hepatocytes, in contrast, lack a pathway from the TGN to the apical (canalicular) surface and rely entirely on the indirect, transcytotic route (3}. The enterocyte-like CaCo-2 cell line uses a mixture of the direct and transcytotic strategies (32, 42). For several apical pro- teins a fraction is delivered directly from the TGN to the api- cal surface, while the balance follows the transcytotic route. MDCK cells can also use the transcytotic route, as was shown for the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transfected into these cells (45), as well as for endogenous proteins (5).  Both the cell type and the protein influence the route taken to the apical surface. For example, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and aminopeptidase N (APN) use the transcytotic route in liver and both routes in CaCo2 cells. When trans- fected into MDCK cells, they mainly use the direct route from the TGN to the apical surface (39, 66). However, about 20% of both travel to the MDCK basolateral surface. In the case of APN, this was judged to be a non-transcytosing pool, although transcytosis was evaluated indirectly (66). If true, this would imply that in MDCK cells, basolateral APN is un- able to be transcytosed and that transcytosis depends on the cell type. In contrast, we found that the 20% of DPP-IV reaching the basolateral surface is then transcytosed (11). The fraction of DPP-IV going to the basolateral surface varies with the cell type, but it is transeytosed efficiently in all cells (40). In contrast the pIgR exclusively uses the trans- cytotic route regardless of the cell type.  Whereas the TGN to apical pathway is present only in cer- tain cells, transcytosis is found in all epithelial cells exam- ined. The importance of transcytotic sorting is emphasized by the fact that while roughly 5% of the cell surface is newly made per hour, the equivalent of about 50% of the cell sur- face is endocytosed per hour (63). Most endocytosed pro- teins simply recycle, but without exquisite selectivity for en- try into the transcytotic pathway, the two surfaces of the cell would be rapidly scrambled.  The amount of a protein at a surface depends on the rates  of delivery and removal due to endocytosis and/or degrada-  577 __label__Scientific

Today, by a vote of 8-7, the Los Angeles city Council rejected a smoking ban in restaurants in favor of a more reasonable smoking restriction measure. The phased-in ordinance proposal would require 60 percent of restaurant seating space be set aside for nonsmokers for two years. Then, the nonsmoker seating would be increased to 70 percent. Signs stating, "smoking is permitted in this establishment" must be posted on restaurant exteriors.     This measure now goes to the City Attorney for redrafting. The new draft will be returned to the City Council for a final vote, probably within the next 60 days. The mayor must then sign the  measure into law. We have no indication that he will not sign this ordinance.  While we are not yet completely out of the woods in L.A., I Know you join me in congratulating everyone who has been involved in this effort. As you know, we have pulled out all the stops to prevent a ban. I am very pleased by the outstanding teamwork that has taken place. The effort to date has been extensive, complex and complete.

Analyses have bean conducted by both R&D and Branch Technical Services. The results of these tescs indicate no significant © loss of menthol or triacetin regardless of storage conditions.  A recommendation is presented that Arctic. Lights filter. rods he handled and stored using normal procedures with. uc special pro- tective maasures being taken to control menthol loss.  INTRODUCTION  During the early development work for Arctic Lights it was rec- ™ ognized that some special precautions might be required to prevent  loss of menthol from filter rods. Dr. Heitkamp obtatned samples  from two trays of filter rods cver/a 5 day period and reported  a substantial loss. of menthol (Dr. N. D. Heitkamp to D. V. Cantrell, April 17, 1978). Dr. Heitkamp's report indicated only a very  slight loss of triacetin. . .  Two possible methods were devised for preventing. menthol loss from Arctic Lights filter rods, The first was a specially con~ structed filter rod tray which was totally enclosed on the top and all four sides. The bottom fit flush with the shelf of a tray trolley to form a nearly air tight container. The second method was a sealed tray trolley with plywood sides, top and bottom, Doors were Fitted ta the trolley with metal frames and felt gaskets.     A series of tests was designed to evaluate the various methods of holding Arctic Lights filter roda.  ssesososs  get 2B  wg : yan __label__Memo

BURR, ELLIE'S NewsExpressf     Page 1 of 2 (SSFLOK16)  By GLENN SINGER BUSINESS WAITER  ROCKVILLE, Md. — Let's face it. Nisn’t easy to quit smoking.  Mast of us know people who have tried smoking cessation clas- ses, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, the drug Zyban and even hypnosis —and then went back ta their pack-a-day habit.  Now, scientists at Nabi, a Boca Raton-based biopharmaceutical company, are working on a new  approach.  and technical support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, they are devel- oping a vac- cine to prevent nicetine from reaching the brain and trig- gering chemi- cal reactions that cause addiction.  “You can try to quit smoking, but the addiction is always there. The desire to smoke hardly ever goes away,” said Robert Naso, a Nabi se- lor vice president who oversees product development at company laboratories in Maryland.  Nabi, which previously special- ized in collecting and providing plasma to other pharmaceutical manufacturers, now focuses its re- search and development efforts on creating and marketing drugs that prevent and treat infectious and au- to-immune diseases.  The company has several clini-     Naso  With financial’  Sun May 28, 2000 Appears On Page 1F Circulation: 391,063  , Vaccine  maker targets  EDT     smokers  cal trials under way in these areas, and has four pharmaceutical prod- ucts on the market. Sales of phar- maceutical and antibody products generated $234 million in 1999 for Nabi, which has 1,750 employees.  ‘Tthad $3.3 million in net income  last year. Its stock has been trading in the $5-6 range recently and closed on Friday at $4.88.  The idea to create an anti-smok- ing vaccine came, in part, from the development ofan unrelated vac- cine for staphylococcus infections that uses similar technology.  The key to getting someone to stop smoking is to find a way to sti- fle the desire, Nabi scientists be- lieve they can accomplish that with an injectable vaccine that not only prevents nicotine molecules from passirig from the bloodstream inta  - the brain, but also prompts the im-  Ml MEDICINE continues on 10F  mune systern to create antibodies that eliminate nicotine from the body.  “It’s a fascinating concept — novel and unique," said Frank Voc- ct, director of the division of treat- ment, research and development for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “The methods we have used to date don’t really work that well. This could be a real advancement.”  The institute announced in April that it had awarded Nabi a four- year grant to conduct further tests on animals, particularly those re- laled to safety, and then conduct human trials. The first year’s por- fion, $776,000, will be released Sept. 30.  if human irials are successtui and the vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration Nic-VAX, as itis called, could be available by 2005, Naso said, The company is seeking a partner to help pay development costs thai could run inte the tens of millions The partner also is needed to heip sell the product in the United Siates, and, possibly, around the warld.  “We think there’s a tremendous potential market for the vaccine worldwide,” Naso said. “Cleariy, this would be a high-valued prod- uct, but it’s far too early to talk about price.”  The scope of the potential niar- ket is huge.  More than 25 percent of a Americans, or about 50 milliun               people, smoke cigarettes. Add i: this an estimated 6 million teen-ap- ers and more than 100,000 childre:. under age 13, according to povern- ment figures. ,  About 80 percent of smakers ex- press a desire to quit, while 26 pur cent actually try. Fewer than 5 per- cent of those who make the attempt succeed for six months or longer. according to the American Psychi- atric Assaciation.  Nabi scientists and their collaba- rators in Minneapolis and Housten are growing excited about the po- ject, now that efficacy testing im mice, rats, rabbits and goats fas shown the vaccine blocks nicotine from entering the brain.  “We are having discussions with the Food and Drug Administrator     Sun-Sentinel __label__News

The plan is to paint it similar to the race bike. Honda is extremely interested in displaying/marketing this bike at other Smokin’ Joe racing series’. They already impact the motorcycle industry.  Per our conversation, Marty, we could utilize this bike within direct maif pieces for the Joe’s VIP club members buy notifying them of the sweepstakes.  Additionally, Mike, you said there Is a possibility we could incorporate the bike in the NASCAR and NHRA MAU's. It would be a great tool to partner all SJR entities and generate new names with a sweepstakes. These two plans would greatly satisfy Hondas reasons for donating the bike.  | know this crosses the lines of job responsibilities, Joe’s VIP Club and MAU activities, however, we have an opportunity.  Currently the agency is developing the new SJR graphics on the reshaped bodywork of the 600cc F3. | will advise both of you on the status.

Qualitatively, Marlboro was perceived to have a "milder taste", “Neasier draw", to be "less harsh", "cooler smoking" and "not have a dry taste in the mouth". A large percentage of these smokers preferred Marlboro because they were milder and not as harsh.  The Winston Red 85mm soft pack smokers significantly preferred (56%/44%) their own brand to Marlboro Red 85mm soft pack. Qualitatively, Winston was perceived to be "more satisfying".

DATE: July 25, 1972 MATERIAL: Synthetic Chemical  SUBJECT: FINAL REPORT a Segment I ~ General Reproduction Performance - Rats  Project No. 642-108  SUMMARY  This study was initiated to evaluate the effect of a synthetic chemical on the general reproductive performance of albino rats. The test material was administered orally to male albino rats for 60 days and to female albino rats for 14 days prior to mating at dosage levels of 0, 15, and 75 mg/kg/day. Approximately one-half of the females were sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation and Caesarean sections were performed. The renaining females were allowed to deliver normally, and the litters  “were carried to weaning. Administration of the test compound continued  throughout the study.  All parental animals survived the study, and no outstanding effects were noted in the males or females. .  There were no meaningful differences in the number and placement of implantation sites, resorption sites, and live fetuses among the females sacrificed on Day 14 of gestation.  Fertility indices for the animals that received the test  material were not meaningfully different from the controls.

March 26, 1984  COMMENTS OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE ON THE POLICY ANALYSIS BOOK ON "ECONOMIC COSTS" OF SMOKING  As a self-admitted antismoking document, the book is unimpressive, Apparently it is intended by its initiator and financial sponsor, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, as a  marketing tool for its stop-smoking gum, Nicorette.  It will be interesting to see the rebuttals to its thesis by others in the antismoking movement who claim the excess cost argument has no merit because smokers’ lives are shorter  and their health care expenses are actually no greater.  We will sit out this argument, though we must wonder why the authors fail to examine the costs nonsmokers must obviously incur over their lifetimes as a basis for comparison.

Nonsmokers have the same chronic illnesses  which are discussed in the book, and many smokers never develop  then.  Overall, we are not impressed with the book.  tn q & te bn __label__Report

Vogt, duty 30, 1997  ABSTRACT The retroviral oncogene gia codes for a pro- tein that belongs to the family of the winged helix transcrip- tion factors. The viral Qin protein, v-Qin, differs from its ‘ellular counterpart, ¢-Qin, by functioning as a stronger .ranscriptional repressor and a more efficient inducer of tumors. This observation suggests that repression may be important in tumorigenesis. To test this possibility, chimeric proteins were constructed in which the Qin DNA-binding domain was fused to either a strong repressor domain (derived trom the Drosophila Engrailed proteia) or 8 strong activator domain (from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein). The chimeric transcriptional repressor, Qin-Engrailed, trans- formed chicken embryo fibroblasts in culture and induced .arcomas in young chickens. The chimeric activator, Qin- VP16. failed to transform cells in vitro or in vivo and caused cellular resistance to oncogenic transformation by Qin. These data support the conclusion that the Qin protein induces oncogenic transformation by repressing the transcription of genes which function as negative growth reguiators or tumor suppressors.  eee UE ESR ASSEN  The oncogene qin was isolated as a cell-derived insert in the zenome of avian retrovirus ASV31, a virus that induces neoplastic transformation in cell culture and sarcomas in young chickens. The viral gin gene (v-qut) is the oncogenic determinant of ASV31. The v-qun gene differs from us cellular counterpart c-gin by an N-terminal leader sequence. several aa substitutions and a C-terminal deletion (1. 2). The Qifi proteins (v-Qin and c-Qin) belong to the family of winged helix transcription factors (2. 3). More than fony members of this family have been described m recent years, they are found m veast. Drosophils, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, rodents, and humans (4. 5). The functions of winged helix proteins are related to embryonal development and tissue differentiation: these proteins are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner (6). A familiar example for winged helix-controlied differen- tiation is the nude mouse whose phenotype results from a defect in the whn gene (7).  The ¢-Qin protein is the avian homolog of the mammalian brain factor | (BF-1); expression of this protein is restricted to the telencephalon, the nasal half of the retina. and the optic stalk (1, 8). A null mutation of the mouse BFI gene leads to death at birth accompanied by dramatic size reduction of the cerebral hemispheres (9). Some genes coding for winged helix proteins have oncogenic potential (3. 10, 11). Viral gen induces neoplastic transformation, presumably due to aberrant tran- scriptional regulation and ectopic expression. in transient transfection, the Qin proteins act as transcriptional repressors. suggesting that this activity may play & role in oncogenicity (2).  a  The publication costs of this article were defrayed m peri by page charge payment.

To examine this possibility. we constructed chimeric transcrip- tion factors containing the Qin DNA-binding motif and het- erologous reguiatory domains of either the Drosopiula En- grailed or herpes simplex virus VP16 proteins. The properties of these chimeric proteins support the conclusion that tran- scriptional repression is a requirement far neoplastic transfor- mation induced by Qin.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Plasmid Construction. To create Qin-Engrailed (En) chi- meras. the PCR-amplified fragments of engratied (amino acids 2-298) (12) and v-gin (amino acids 1-251} (3) or chicken c-gia (amino acids 1-243) (1) were cloned consecutively into the HindI-Xbal or BamH-Hindill sites of the same pBK/RSV vector (Stratagene). Oligonucleotide primers designed for PCR included BamHI. HindHl. and Xbal restriction sites allowing im-frame cloning. All DNA fragments derived from PCR amplification were sequenced using primers internal to the gut or engratied coding sequences or T3 and T7 primers. Oin-VP16 chimeras were constructed by exchanging an Espl- EcoRI fragment of either c-gen or v-qur with a BumHI-EcoR! fragment of plasmid 597.1 coding for the transactivation domain of the VP16 protein (13). The cohesive ends generated by BamHI or Espl digestion were filled in wath Klenow polymerase. The resultant Qin-VP16 and Qin-En plasmids were cleaved with either BamHI-EcoRI| or BamHI-Cial for cloning into the retroviral expression vector RCAS (14) to yield RCAS-Qin-En and RCAS-Qin-VP 16. Transfection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with the RCAS vectors leads to the production of infectious RCAS retroviruses that replicate and express the cloned insert. The reciprocal recom- binants between v-gin and c-qui. VC and CV. have been described (2).  Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays. Circular pBK/ RSV plasmids with inserts coding for c-Qin. v-Qin. c-Qin-En. v-Qin-En, c-Qin-VP16. or v-Qin-VP1I6 were used as tem- plates for in vitro transiation in a transcription and translation coupled system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pfomega). Wheat germ lysates containing translated proteins were used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described (2). The relative amounts of translated proteins were estimated by labeling the proteins with {“Sjmethionine (40 4Ci in 50 wl reaction volume: | Ci = 37 GBq) followed by SDS/PAGE and autoradiography.  Transfection and Focus Assays. Assavs for transcriptional regulation in CEF cultures were carried oul using transicnt transfection with the calcium phosphate precipitation method (15).

MONTHLY SUMMARY  25 JANUARY 1986- 24 FEBRUARY 1986  FOR: David Douglas 1. Non-burning smoking article:  Additional work on this subject was done this month by examining the filtration effect of a cellulose acetate filter versus no filter. The sample examined was an IFF tobacco neutral fraction flavor. Fifty microliters of the sample were applied to a piece of filter paper inside a plastic tube like those used by Flavor Development for the non-burning smoking article. Thirty-five ml puffs were withdrawn alternately at one end containing a CA filter and at the other end, which was open. The results of chromatograms produced by samples taken in these ways showed that the later, more polar, less volatile components are reduced disproportionately when puffed through the CA filter compared to a sample taken with no filter.  This observation could have implications for the use of tobacco-identical flavors in both burning and non-burning smoking products, since this flavor is apparently natural and therefore representative of tobacco-identical flavors.  No additional work is anticipated in this area unless it is desired by supervisors of the Chemical Research Division, as an aid to Divisional goals or major R&D programs. However, a memo summarizing the observations made to date is being written.  2. Setup of an electron capture detector:  Some additional work with the ECD (discussed last month) was done, mostly to document the work on the PE data system. However in the course of this work the lower limits of detectability of Lindane and Aldrin were explored and more difinitively determined. It was found that approximately  300-400 femtograms (10-13 grams) of either pesticide could be detected at a 2:1 signal to noise ratio, but about half this amount could not. A minimum  of 15 picograms of each of the pesticides were detected in 3 microliters of a bright tobacco extract. The accuracy of the concentration of the pesticide standard being used was compared with a completely separate standard of Lindane, and the amounts from each source were found to be equal within normal experimental variability.  A memo concerning this work is being written, and no further work will be done in this area unless a need arises.  FITSZOTSOe __label__Scientific

&  DIET MATERIALFOUND ~TOUAFFECT THE BRAIN  - Discovery Is Already in Use, With Promising Results, in Treating One Widespread Disorder        By HAROLD M. SCHIMECK Jr,  A common dietary substance found in| -  eggs, meat and fish has surprisingly di- yect and almost immediate effects on brain function, scientists at Massachu- setts Institute of Technology have found.  Their discovery has already been used, with promising results, in treating one widespread and disabling brain disorder. Research is in progress to see if the com- mon food substance called choline might also be useful in other brain conditions, including depression and the memory de- fects that are am important factor in se- nility.  All of these efforts stem from the dis- covery a few years ago that choline passes into the blood from food in the  _ digestive tract, is taken up directly by ‘the brain from the circulating blood. and is used to help the brain make an impor-  . tant chemical transmitter of nerve sig-  , tals, On an hour-to-hour basis the amount of the nerve signal transmitter in the brain seems to depend on how  * ruuch choline-rich food the individuel has eaten recently, :  “This is very sirange,” said Dr. Richard 3, Wurtman at an interview in his labora- tory in Cambridge, Mass. “because means that the composition of each meal will directly affect the synthesis of chemical signals in the brain.” .  For years it had been generally believed that something called the blood-brain barrier protecied the brain from direct effects of substances either lacking or  ‘excessive in a day-to-day diet. Only a few things, notably alcohol and some  powerful drugs such as the narcotics,|°  were thought to be exceptions, Gaps in the Barrier  Recent discoveries show that the blood . brain barrier has more gaps than had been thought, Thus, the person who eats  a large omelet with its high choline con- % will within a few hours have en oly of the nerve signal trastamite i6f Calied Guetyicholine in the brain.  This, according te Dr. Wurtman, wilt mean an amplification of the nerve sig. nals sent from one nerve cell to the next by those cells that use acetylcholine for' the signaling.  The possible effects of this on behavior are being studied. ,                 shane  i     New York Times January 26, 1978  wae  -—""""" the “main practical consequence that  " use of the antipsychotic drugs is discon-  . tlon probably affects many thousands of  * prolonged periods.  ‘ soon as Dr. Wurtman and a graduate , student, Edith L. Cohen, published a re-  __ ment in their dyskinesia symptoms.  has emerged from the work to date is in the treatment of a common disorder called tardive dyskinesia. This is a condi-  ‘tion that develops in many mental pa- > tients under regular treatment with either  of the two main classes of antipsychotic!  ‘ drugs, the phenothiezines or the buty-; ’ rophenones, These drugs are used to caim!  the patients and free them from the acute!  symptoms of their mental illness.  After months or years of taking these:  " drugs, patients often develop uncontrolla-  ble jecking movements of the upper body and limbs, facial grimaces and bizarve movements of the tongue. This is the characteristic pattern of tardive dyskine-; aa Psychologically Crippling ©  For a person already handicapped by the problems of mental illness these bi- zarre movements can he psychologically crippling. Yet there has been no effective; treatment for the condition and it has sometimes been permanent even when  tinued. One recent report said that as many as 40 percent of elderly, chronically| hospitalized mental patients using the drugs suffered from tardive dyskinesia and that it could be found in 3 percent  or more of a mixed population of mental| ,  patients, including the young. Those figures indicate thet the ‘condi-  Americans whe have taken the drugs for  The condition apparently results from a failure of brain nerve cells to release enough acetylcholine. For that reason, as  port indicating that rats’ brains producd extta amounts of the transmitter when they had extra choline in the blood, doo- tors at Stanford University fed choline  ‘to a tardive dyskinesig patient to see|  if it would hety, It did.  Last fali, Dr. Wurtman and three col- leagues, Dr. John H. Growdon, Madelyn Hirsch and Dr. William Wiener, published the results of a carefully controlled study in the New England Journal of Medicine, reporting that nine patients fed choline for two weeks showed major improve-     50265293  : didt, according  "Some Believed More Complex Gne patient’s symptoms were made  worse and 10 others showed no change.) - Dr. Wurtman believes this indicates that  the group of patients included some whose conditions stemmed from some- thing more complex than the classic tar-' dive dyskinesia. ~ .  .. In current studies, the grouy in Boston is substituting the choline-rich food suh-  _ stance lecithin for choline.  The richest source of lecithin In the  also found in the American diet as a  , widespresd and increasingly used food  additive. It is a good enwisifier and has other properties useful in commercially prepared cakes, gravies, salad dressings, beverage mixes and chocolate-covered candies. Commercial lecithin contains about 2 percent to 4 percent choline, Dr.  ’ Judith Wortman estimates.  No comparable hypotheses have arisen yet from the choline studies, but scien- tists at several institutions are studying possible ways in which this chemical can  _ be used to help the human brain.  Pursuing a clue concerning the chemis- try of memory, for example, Dr, David  * Drachman of the University of Massachu-  setts at Worcester, is trying choline as a possible help in preventing memory Joss among persons suffering from cerlain kinds of senility.  Following another clue, Dr, John Davis  of the University of Chicago has been; gesting the effects of choline in two;  taajor types of mental illness, the sorme- times related manic and depressive states. He is working on the hypothesis that beth conditions result fram derange- ment of a balance between two important nerve signal transmitters, norepinephrine and acetylcholine, with choline too high in depression and norepinephrine too high in mania. :  te Dr. Wurunen's wife,|” .

Soulland  MORANDUM . MEMO April 9, 1986  TO: A.W. Spears  FROM: A.M. Ihrig  SUBJECT: Laboratory Test Results on Some Sample Cigarettes Used in the Technical Study Group for the 1984 Cigarette Safety Act  A series of 32 cigarettes were prepared for the Technical Study Group as directed in the 1984 Cigarette Safety Act. Specifi- cations of these cigarettes are given in the November 4, 1985 memorandum of Dr. A.W. Spears. The series of cigarettes were evaluated for smoke deliveries and linear burn rates. These results are given in Table 1 and 2 for the 21 mm and 25 mm circumference cigarettes.  This series covers a linear burn rate range of 3.40 mm/min to 10.63 mm/min. The linear burn rates between the corresponding 21 mm and 25 mm samples were similar except for the expanded flue-cured cigarettes (21 mm, 13-16) and (25 mm, 29-32). These differences are illustrated in Figure l.  In this study, paper porosity influences smoke deliveries more than paper additives. A decrease in porosity from 75 to 10 CORESTA resulted in a 20 to 40 percent increase in nicotine, CPM and CO deliveries. The addition of citrate caused a modest increase in CO and a 5 to 15 percent reduction in CPM and nicotine.  Burn rate studies were conducted between FNLN-21, the slowest burning cigarette, and BNLC-21 whose linear burn rate of 5.79 mn/min is more consistent with commercial cigarettes. This study shows very little difference between FNLN-21 and BNLC-21 ona select group of fabrics. The results shown in Table III include  a previous study involving a set of four cigarettes on 33 different fabrics.     /jwel  Xec: C.I. Lewis C.L. Tucker  ZvOESTTs __label__Memo

Hudnall Christopher, Jr. Executive Vice President  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Winston-Salem, N.C. 27102  Dear Hudnall: Wukh  The Monograph on the new cigarette was here on my desk when I returned to New York, and I really have enjoyed reading this. Needless to say, I did not absorb every nuance, but the overall impact of the document is very positive.  First of all, I am impressed with the meticulous nature of your studies and the exemplary way in which they are presented. Obviously your peer review committee felt the same  way.  Next, the product of itself is impressive. I was astonished when I saw it "in action" at our meeting with you, and now the analysis of the concept and the construction is equally impressive.  Finally, you have done a very good thing in producing this document. It should help the new product gain public as well as scientific acceptance. There would seem to be little doubt that you are on the right track.  When I have absorbed a little more from the volune, I will pass it around the office so that all can see this.  I am enclosing a summary of the neuroendocrine effects  of nicotine, prepared by Dr. Don Ford of our staff here at CTR.  Don is a neuroanatomist, who has a long-standing interest in nicotine effects, and he has prepared an excellent summary which might be of interest to Bob DiMarco or some of the members of his staff.  Thanks for the welcome on our recent visit and thanks for letting me see the book.  Sincerely, S Minamata as Om = o eye games F.

To: From:  Subject:  PHILIP MORRIS INCORPORATED INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  100 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 owe 4 ° ‘| Y  - Mr. Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Date: Jahuary 18, 1974  » George Weissman  * Milprint Pulp Contract  The December meeting of the Board of Directors of Philip Morris Incorporated approved in principle authorization of a pulp contract to be signed by Milprint subject to clearing up two questions Legal raised. The Corporate Legal Depart~- ment has raised no further questions about the contract, and after speaking to each member of the Executive Committee, I have authorized Milprint to enter final negotiations with The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company for the purchase of 12,000 tons of pulp annually for ten years beginning in 1976.  Currently, Nicolet is paying $265.00 per ton. For purposes of calculation, it could be assumed that the pulp purchased under the proposed contract will cost approximately $300.00 per ton.  The Great Lakes Pulp and Paper Company, which is controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, has been a supplier to Nicolet for seven years. The relation- ship has been mutually satisfactory and Great Lakes' reputation is excellent.  The Milprint contract is a "take and pay" contract as are the others, and the financing of the new mill will be based on this paper. The mili will have a  capacity of 300,000 tons annually, 250,000 of which have already been committed to Milprint, Johnson and Johnson, Bergstrom Paper Company, National Cash Register, Proctor and Gamble, St. Regis Paper, Nekoosa Edwards, Fox River Paper and Landon  Paper.  The contract price will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase and although there is no contract guarantee that the price paid will be the lowest price available, pulp prices have traditionally been uniform within the industry. If the mill is not in operation by 1976, we can withdraw from the contract.  This annual 12,000 tons of pulp could be used in emergencies for flip top box and soft pack production for the Philip Morris tobacco operations.

PHILIP MORRIS EUROPE S.A.  LEAF OPERATIONS BRILLANCOURT 4 - 1001 LAUSANNE . SWITZERLAND  INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  To: K Schmidt Date: 21 October, 1999 From: E. de Borst cc: MAS, JAG, AKA, TEB, GAE.  Subject: PROJECT PALOMINO  Recommendation  Reference is made to the attached subjective evaluation results, which were very conclusive and in favor of a total elimination of both urea and ammonia  rather than urea only.  For all blends in the EU region we, therefore, recommend to discontinue the usage of RLB and BL, in favor of the utilisation of RLE and Cast Leaf.  Implementation considerations and strategy  1. Priority will be given to production for Norway. As of the November 99- production, implement the ML PE blend with CL and RLE for FF, MED and Lights in MUG/FTR. There is no impact on tobacco weight. For Merit and Merit Ultra, production at FTR, the project Hill blend standardisation using CL/RLE is recommended. It should be noted that also production of CH Domestic and Duty Free are to follow to ensure sufficient volumes to use full batches of filler. A weight saving is foreseen. Sufficient cast leaf to support this production will be supplied ex Bremen to FTR.  2. Second priority will be given to production for UK. In view of production volumes and availability of cast leaf, production can only begin in  S8PZ6PEL0z __label__Memo

P.8  APR 28 95 0744 READ-POLAND/214/768-6867  Monday, April 3, 1995        Risk of infant  that no smoke is safe smoke.  Anti-abortion activists concerned with the well- being of fetuses should per- haps start supporting anoth: § ef group of protesters — the opponents of secondhand § smoke.  Roughly one-fourth of 4 American women smoke TOM  while pregnant, and perhaps SJE QFRIED as Many as half of nonsmok-  ing pregnant women are exposed to the smoke of others. Nicotine from this smoke makes its way to the fetus, and medical researchers have document- ed several damaging consequences. Nicotine expo- sure has been linked to a higher rate of spontaneous abortions, lower birth weights and a higher rate of attention deficit disorder.  Furthermore, a study published this month found a substantial increase in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (commonly known as “crib death”) among infants exposed to smoke before birth.  SIDS kills more than 5,000 babies per year in the United States; more babies between the age of 1 month and 1 year die of SIDS than from any other cause. The causes of crib death have long been mysterious — and in fact, part of the definition of SIDS is that the death is unexplained. But while the  "unknown causes of SIDS aren’t likely to be simple, cigarette smoke seems to be a factor.  Smoking by mothers, fathers or other people in the same room with a baby greatly increases the crib death risk, researchers from the University of Cali- fornia, San Diego, reported last month in the Jour- nal of the American Medical Association.  “The greater the total number of cigarettes the infant was passively exposed to after birth from all adults, the higher the risk of SIDS,” wrote Hillary Sandra Klonoff-Cohen and colleagues.  Furthermore, smoke raises the risk of SIDS even when the exposure comes before birth. When fa- thers smoked in the presence of a nonsmoking mother during pregnancy, for example, the risk of infant crib death more than tripled. If the mother smoked during pregnancy, the risk wag even great- er, the researchers found.  Of course, such research represents only an in- dictment of cigarette smoke as a baby killer and not yet a conviction, for a correlation is not proof of a cause-and-effect relationship. Still, other research has begun to show evidence of how nicotine might do direct damage to the developing fetal brain.  In a recent issue of the journal Developmental               Tbedaltas Foming Nang  death suggests.     Brain Research, Stanford University scientists Le, ported that prenatal nicotine exposure can’altels activity in the part of the brain responsibje for maintaining the biological clock. eee  Biological clocks are the pacemakers of life? poets lating various. bodily functions including slebp‘oy--. cles and body temperature. In mammals the biologi. cal clock is under the control of a small clunip.of: brain cells called the suprachiasmatic nucleus? >. -s  Studying laboratory rats, the Stanford restatcli-: ers injected mothers-to-bé with nicotine and’ then, examined resulting changes in brain processés in‘ both the mother and fetuses. (Comparisons; were~ made to a group of rats injected with saling séld~. tion.) Nicotine caused several changes in brain’ac-+ tivity, and for the most part the changes werd the? same in mother rat and babies-to-be.  In the last few days before birth, however, nico- tine induced a change in the fetuses’ suprachiasma- tic nuclei, though not in the mothers’. The change was the switching into sction of a particular gene known as c-fos. Among other things, c-fos plays an important role in the regulation of circadian. |. rhythms — the daily rhythms of the biological’ - clock. So by altering c-fos activity, nicotine likely gave the fetal rats an artificial form of jety Jag, .|-           throwing the circadian rhythm of mothers and;ba- "  bies out of sync. “?  “If nicotinic ... stimulation in the fetus has an effect on the biological clock, there could be poten-.-. tially damaging effects,”"Thomas Kilduff and col-: leagues wrote. Interference with circadian rhythms'- might throw off the normal process of mother-child’. bonding, for example.  “It is possible that the increased incidence of" Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. and. Attention | Defi- cit Disorders in the offspring of maternal smokers . may be related to this very mechanism,” the Stan-.. ford scientists speculated.  It may be no coineldence, the researchers” suge gest, that the peak period of SIDS desths — in infants 2 to 4 months old — corresponds to a time when the . babies’ circadian rhythm cycles are being eataby. lished.  More research is needed to pin down the possible aks between smoke, circadian rhythms and’ SIDS. But results so far clearly suggest that the dangers of’ secondhand smoke may go far beyond a small Statis-' tical increase in the Hkelihood of lung cancer.  Tn the chemistry of the developing brain, tiny amounts of certain substances can have serious. effects that last a lifetime, such as making’ that: lifetime very, very short. .

——  Proc, NGtl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 89, pp. 8889-8893, October 1992 Biochemistry  An inhibitory carboxyl-terminal domain in Ets-1 and Ets-2 mediates differential binding of ETS family factors to promoter sequences of  the mb-I gene  (DNA-binding proteins/B-cell-specific gene expression)  James HAGMAN AND RUDOLF GROSSCHEDL  Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, and Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco,  CA 94143-0414  Communicated by Haroid E. Varmus, May 28, 1992 ©  ABSTRACT The mb-I gene is expressed only during the early stages of B-lymphocyte differentiation. Here we show that the mb-J proximal promoter region contains a functionally important binding site for members of the ETS family of DNA-binding proteins. We found that both the E26 virus- encoded y-ets and the myeloid/B-cell-specific factor PU.1 bind efficiently to this site in vitro. By contrast, Ets-1, the lympho- cyte-specific cellular homologue of v-ets, and the related, more ubiquitously expressed Ets-2 protein interacted weakly with this binding site. DNA binding by both Ets-1 and Ets-2, however, could be increased 20- to 50-fold by deleting as few as 16 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The inhibitory carboxyl- terminal amino acid sequence is highly conserved between Ets-1 and Ets-2 but is not present in either v-ets or PU.1. Replacement of the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of v-ets with those of Ets-1 decreased DNA binding by v-ets drastically. Cotrapstation of Ets-1 transcripts encoding proteins of differ- ent lengths suggested that Ets-1 binds DNA as a monomer. Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal inhibitory domain appears to interfere directly with DNA binding and not with homodimer- ization, Finally, the functional relevance of ETS factor binding to the mb-I promoter site was evidenced by the stimulation of trarscription through this site by a v-myb-v-ets fusion protein. Together, these data suggest that one or more ETS family factors are involved in the regulation of mb-1 gene expression.     The B-lymphocyte-specific mb-J gene is a model for the regulation of lineage- and stage-specific gene expression. The mb-I gene encodes a 32-kDa protein that is required for the expression of IgM molecules on the B-cell surface (for review, see ref. 1). Specific mb-] transcripts have been found only in cells that comprise the early stages of B-lymphoid-cell differentiation (2). Tissue culture transfection experiments suggested that proximal mb-1 promoter sequences. residing between nucleotides —68 to +70 contain sufficient informa- tion for early B-cell-specific gene expression (3). Analysis of linker scanning and deletion mutations across this region indicated the importance of at least two distinct nuclear factor-binding sites for mb-! promoter function (3). Both sites were shown to interact with ubiquitous factors in vitro. One factor was identified as Spl, whereas the identity of the second factor, termed MUF2 (b-/ upstream factor 2), is unknown. Interestingly, the MUF2 site is identical to a sequence within the polyomavirus enhancer region (PEA3 site) that is recognized by the nuclear DNA-binding protein Ets-1 in vitro (4). Ets-1, which is expressed primarily in lymphoid tissues, has been implicated as a tissue-specific regulator of transcription (for review, see ref. 5). Therefore, the question arises as to whether Ets-1 or another lymphoid-     The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked “advertisement” in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §1734 solely to indicate this fact.  8889  specific factor can bind the MUF2 site and participate in the regulation of mb-! gene expression.  The ETS family of nuclear proteins is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding motif referred to as the ETS domain (6). Two members of the ETS family, the B- and T-cell- specific Ets-1 and myeloid/B-cell-specific PU.1 proteins, are expressed in a cell-type-specific manner that suggests a role in the regulation of lymphoid-specific genes (7-11). By con- trast, Ets-2, which is closely related to Ets-1, is expressed in a wide range of tissue types and cultured cells (8, 9, 12). The v-ets polypeptide is encoded by a transduced c-ers-/ gene expressed by the avian retrovirus E26 as part of a tripartite fusion protein, p135es-myb<ts (13, 14).  Here we report that Ets-1 and PU.1 bind the mb-/ promoter in vitro, although with different efficiencies. We show that this differential DNA binding is governed by the presence of inhibitory carboxyl-terminal amino acids in Ets-1 and Ets-2, which are absent in PU.1 or v-ets.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Plasmid Construction and i Vitro Mutagenesis. Plasmids pv-etsHS4 and pv-etsHB2 contain either the Apa I-Stu I or Hpa \-Bgl I fragments of pe-etsm (provided by J. M. Bishop, University of California, San Francisco) for expression in vitro (15). The murine c-ets-1 cDNA clone SKc-ets1.6 (16) was provided by J. H. Chen (M.D, Anderson Cancer Center, Houston). The murine Ets-2 (c-ets2-KS+) and PU.1 (PU.1- KS+) cDNA clones were provided by R. Maki (LaJolla Cancer Research Center). Mutations were introduced by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (3) and primers: pce-etsN385D, 5’-CAGTTTCTCATAATCCATCTTAG- GTTTGT; c-etsI401V, 5'-CGTCTTGTGGATGACATTTT- TGTCATAATAGTAGCG; pc-etsCAl, 5'-CGTGCAGC- TCTTCAGGGATCGATCACAGCAGGCTCTGCAGG; and PU.1AC, 5’-GGCCAGGCCCCCACGTC- ACTGCA- GCTCGCCGCTGAACTGG. The plasmid pEts-I/v-ets was constructed by insertion of the HindIII-Sal I fragment of pe-etsm into SKc-ets1.6, and -pv-ets/Ets-1 was made by insertion of the Eco47III-Not I fragment of SKc-ets1.6 into pv-etsHS4, po-etsHCA (to make Ets-LANAC; see Fig. 4) was constructed by deletion of the Hpa I fragment from pc- etsCAl. EVE26S3 and EVE26A2 were made by subcloning the 2.2-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment of pc-etsm into EVRF2 (17).  In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Protein Analysis. Plasmid DNA was transcribed in vitro, and RNA transcripts were purified with Qiagen columns as suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Ets-2AC protein was translated from RNA transcribed from c-ets2-KS+ DNA     Abbreviations: wt, wild type; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltrans- ferase; MUF2, mb-I upstream factor 2. __label__Scientific

RHODE II?  Department of Pathology and Microbiology and The Eppley institute, The University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198  Recewved February 14, 1991; accepted May 2. 1991  We generated @ mutation in the gene for the nonstructural protein NS2 of Parvovirus H-1 in which the highly conserved dinucleotide AG at the 3' splica acceptor site of NS2 intron 1 wes mutated to CG, The mutation does not change the amino acid sequence for NS?. The splice acceptor (SA} mutant gene was introduced into the H-1 virus {H-1SA) and an infectious clone of Lulil (pLUH1SA). Tha A2 transcripts encoding NS2 were absent by both Northern blot and primer extension anelysis in the LuH1SA or H-1SA virus-infacted cells and the NS2 protein was undetectable in the infected ceil lysate by immunoprecipitation. These NS2 null mutant viruses were capable of lytic growth in cell lines that were derived from human, hamster, and dog, but they produced lower virus titers than wild-type H-1, The H.1SA virus nonproductively infected Rat2 rat fibroblasts and transformed Rat? cell lines: Analysis of synchronized infections of rat fibroblasts demonstrated thet H-1SA viral duplex replicative form ONA replication was reduced and that single-stranded progeny DNA was deficient compared to wild-type H-1.in addition, H-iSA viral protein synthesis was about 10% of wild-type virus and virions were nat detectable in rat fibroblasts. However, H-1SA mRNAs R1 and R3 accumulated to wild-type levels. NS2 was also required for productive infection in newborn rats but not in newborn hamsters. These results indicate that NS2 plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells  in vivo and in vitro, ©1991 Academic Press. Inc.  INTRODUCTION  Autonomous parvoviruses contain a linear, single- stranded (SS) DNA genome of about 5 kb. The geno- mic organization has been found to be identical among the radent parvoviruses. The viral genome encodes two overlapping transcription units; the early promoter, P4, at the left-hand end of the viral genome produces the transcripts R1 and R2 which synthesize the non- structural proteins NS1 and NS2, respectively, and the late promoter, P38, generates the R3 transcripts which are translated into the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP (Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987).  NS1 protein is coded for by a single exon and is predicted by the sequence to have a motecular weight of 76 kDa. However, NS1 migrates as several 84- to 88-kDa bands on polyacrylamide gels. The slower mo- bitty of the B8-kDa form of NS1 is due to phosphoryla- tion {Rhode and Iversen, 1990: Iversen and Rhode, 1990; Paradiso, 1984). NS1 accumulates in the nu- cleus and it is essential for viral DNA replication (Berns etal, 1988; Rhode, 1989; Tratschin ef a/., 1984: Li and Rhode, 1990), P4 and P38 promoter regulation (Labow etal, 1986; Rhode, 1985; Rhode, 1987b; Tratschin et  ‘We reported the preliminary data of tis study at the Amencan Society for Virology Annual Meeting, workshop No. 39, July 8-12,  1990. * To whom requests for reprints should be addressed.  PUBLICATIONS  V7  al, 1986), and cytotoxicity (Labow ef a/., 1987; Rhode, 19872; Li and Rhode, 1990).  NS2 is a much smaller protein with only 188 amino acids in parvovirus H-1 and migrates at 25-28 kDa on polyacrylamide gels. NS2 protein of minute virus of mice (MVM) has three isoforms (Morgan and Ward, 1986; Jongeneel ef af, 1986; Clamens er a/., 1990; Cotmore and Tattersall, 1990) and H-1 should have at least two. The major one is encoded by three exons with a large intron and 4 smail intron removed during the splicing process. Exon 1 of NS2 shares the sarne Start codon at nucleotide 264 with the NS1 gene, thus NS2 and NS1 have an identical 84 amino acids at their amino terminus; exon 2, located at the carboxyl-ter- minus of the NS 1 gene. is translated in a different read- ing frame from NS1; exon 3 encodes only 6 amino acids. The minor isoform of NS2 is produced by using an alternative splice donor and acceptor site for intron 2. Translation terminates betore its splice donor site, therefore its exon 2 is 6 amino acids longer than the major form of NS2 and there is no translated exon 3. Thus, the two isoforms of NS2 differ only by the 6 amino acids at their carboxyl-terminal end (Rhode and Iversen, 1990; Iversen and Rhode, 1990) (Fig. 1).  The function of NS2 has not been well defined. Since NS1 is essential to virus replication, it is difficult to sap- arate the gene of NS2 from NS1 and generate muta- tions in the NS2 gene without affecting the structure of NS1. To approach this problem, we have successfully  0042-6822/91 $3.00 Copynght @ 1891 by Academe Praga, inc Allnghte ol reproduction in eny form resenvad  030901  10350215 __label__Scientific

HUDSON, Mass. ° SUN — D. 8,720: — BOSTON METROPOLITAN AREA  1968  JUL §  Bob Pryor  All Lip Service .. Little Action     Several years ago the U. S, Surgeon General made an announcement about the hazards of cigarette smok: ing and the connection with cancer. The Medicatf™®Po- fession has linked smoking with cancer and poor health, and a small TV advertising campaign has been sug- gesting that cigarettes are a healilt hazard.  Congress passed weak legislation requiring the fo!- lowing words be printed on everv cigarette pack: “Cau. tien: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous To Your  Now the Public Health Service has released: an- other report on smoking. The release says ihat a heavy cigarette smoker may be shortening his life by eight years if he continues the habit. In addition to calling the cigarette habit the main cause for lung cancer, the report said the habit can: contribute to the develop- ment of fatal heart disease.  This is the first time that the PHS has linked heart coronaries to cigarette smoking in an official report. Secretary Wilbur Cohen. of the Health. Welfare, and Education Department suggested to Congress the words on cigarette packages should be changed to: “Warning: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer and other causes.”  The FTC went a step further and suggested that cigarette advertising should be prohibited on television.  Tt.is obvious the big money interests of the Cigar- ette Industry will prevent any substantial action by the Congress. The politicians will use the same excuse that was used here in Massachusetts recently in regard to billboard advertising.  A bill to curb billboard. advertising by giving the towns and cities véf@ power was killed’ because state representatives argued it would put a lot of people out of work. This same weak excuse will undoubtedly: he used in Congress in regard to cigarettes .. . despite the  far more important consideration of the health and. wel- fare of the people.  The human being is weak. and the only Wav cigar- ette smokers are going to quit the habit. is through, some kind of prohibition, All the verbal and written:  ' warnings in the world will not curb smoking. Those  with the habit know it’s unhealthy but haven't the will to stop. I'am no exception.  The Medical Profession tells people they should not smoke, and many: doctors tell their vatients thev should quit smoking. But the hollow words fall'on deat ears because the medical authorities do not practice vhat they preach and are really. doing little to help people quit the habit.  If cigarettes are really a health hazard, it is time that health and medical leaders stonned the “lip serv- ice” and do something about it, Action speaks louder than words.  You can still buy cigarettes in hospitals, You can still buy cigarettes in drug stores.  And in. most medical centers and doctor's offices,  ‘ you can still smoke in the waiting rooms. And; many.  doctors who speak against cigarettes are smokers them- selves.  You can’t buy poisonous drugs in drug stores with- out a prescription, and you certainly can't get them in a hosvital. All materials that may be injurious to:one’s health in a hospital are locked up .. . alll except cigar- et.es!  Perhaps it’s time. for the Surgeon General. Public Health Service. Federal Trade Commission, and atl medical authorities to fish or cuti bait. Fi:Her take. real action or stop pussy-footing around with a meuth full of words without teeth,  CEVEO09TOe __label__News

Group J consisted of ten animals that. were sub- jected to CS of one cigarette daily for six days per week. Estimated on a weight basis one cigarette per day in a rabbit Is equivalent to smoking 30 cigarettes per day in man. They were maintained on 2 standard laboratory ration and water ad lib. Group 2 consisted of a similar number  that received the standard ration tu which 2% cholesterol was added.

PROPOSAL  Several workers have demonstrated the effects of carbon monoxide on myocardial metabolism and coronary blood flow. However, the direct effect of carbon monoxide on the contractility of isolated heart muscle has nob been thoroughly investigated. I propose to conduct a pilot study of this phenomena utilizing a Blink's isolated heart muscle apparatus and a range of carbon monoxide concentrations which will be determined experimentally. On the basis of information obtained from this investigation, further studies would be planned utilizing a working heart apparatus.  Right ventricles removed from laboratory rats would be isolated in a Krebs-Ringers solution, attached to a force transducer and electrically stimulated. After equilibration with 95% 05 - 52% C055 the preparation would be challenged by bubbling various concentrations of CO - O5 - 5% COg through the medium and changes in function compared to the control period noted.  Finally, 95% 09 ~ 5% CQ) would again be bubbled through the medium and  recovery of function assessed.  In addition to being recorded on the Grass recorder, the wave form of the contraction and stimulus pulse will be displayed on and photographed by a Hewlett- Packard Oscilliscope-camera system. In this manner the onset and decline of developed tension, the latency period between stimulus and contraction, and the  resting tension during the pre-C0, the CO and recovery from CO periods will be  compared. The information obtained in this functional analysis would then be used as the basis for a more detailed study of the biochemical and electrolyte changes  produced in cardiac muscle as a result of CO exposure.     50260322 __label__Scientific

Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 1998 8:54 AM  To: Laufer, David; Lenzi, Jack; Smith, Dan; Comes, Cheryl (PMUSA Mac Mail) Subject: Retail Leaders/RD's  I spoke with Randy Lawrence about roll-out of retail leaders and how best to get the RD's in the loop. He's happy to do a presentation if they're all  fogether, but since that's not happening for a while......1 think the way we want to proceed is just asking the RD's to get in touch with VPRS's or SSD's  in their area to arrange to sit in on one of the roll-out meetings.  The new program is being presented at each of the current regional LEAP meetings. One meeting for each of the 5 regions. Regions 3 and 4 are done, but 1,2 and 5 still to go, so the RD's can call the corresponding VPRS's if they'd like to attend for the 3rd day of the LEAP meeting (that's when RL program will be presented). After that, there will be district by district meetings with the TSM's to go through the program in detail. The RD's can call their SSD contact(s) to arrange to sit in on any of those meetings.

PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. rc INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE 720 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017 TO: Field wae DATE: March 21, 1994  FROM: Barbara Reuter/Sales Programs and Information  SUBJECT: PM USA Point of Sale Material Philosophy  Maintaining the competitive advantage that has been developed over time for our brand trademarks is critical to their future success. Creating and placing POS which enhances the  added value of our brands is also critical and must be properly managed to ensure that our overall corporate strategies and objectives are met.  To assist the field sales force in accomplishing these goals, the following clarifies our corporate philosophy regarding POS and outlines initiatives currently under development.  Flex Fund Price Off Promotion POS  As communicated previously on February 17, 1994 in Document 155, for the second quarter and until further notice, all Flex Funds are to be used exclusively for running Marlboro Price Off Promotions. Non-customized Marlboro Price Off POS will continue to be available in support of these promotions.  Additionally, several types of custom Marlboro Price Off POS will also be available to accounts that want to include their store name or logo.  To further support price promotion, whenever possible, a price call out space will be included on B headers to communicate pricing.  Effective immediately the types of POS detailed above are to be used exclusively for Marlboro Price Off Promotions.  Continuous POS for all Brands  In an effort to upgrade all continuous brand POS, senior sales management will be requested to identify ongoing requiremenis for at least four brands, excluding Marlboro. Select POS items will then be produced and made available to the field. Details regarding ihese items will be communicated under separate cover.  i lagem ix As you know, optimal placement of POS and fixturing is essential to maximize the return on our investment. As a result, ideal store layouts which illustrate the preferred placement of PM USA POS and fixturing will be developed for each trade class. This information should be used as a guide to achieve the desired PM USA look in each account.  Your support of this philosophy is imperative if we are to achieve a strong presence for our brands. Together we can ensure that our brands are advertised in a manner that is consistent with our long-term goals.

1 gee              ly) Qs ape oy . | September 11, 1979  Mr. J. A, Herberger a  Re: NORTHWOODS LOGGER CAMPAIGN - CAMPAIGN PORTFOLIO STUDY  Background And Objectives     WINSTON Full Flavor has recently switched its national advertising  from the Candid campaign to the Northwoods Logger campaign. It was decided to run the new campaign based on positive results from  previous research on the Logger execution from the Occupational campaign. This research suggested that individual executions from  the new campaign would be impactful and would communicate the brand's strategy of good taste and masculine imagery. However, it was desirable to determine the degree to which the new campaign might approach the Marlboro campaign in potential for the total campaign to communicate not only good taste, but more importantly  a desirable smoker imagery.     sinter wg came emmy te re ge  Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows:  1. Determine potential campaign communication in terms of smoker imagery and product benefits.  teen meet meme ge  2. Assess the perception of the Northwoods Logger personality image. This would be accomplished by:  a. Determining whether the personality imagery is highly defined /single minded.  Fiennes wanareare  b. Determining what is the definition of the personality image.  c. Assessing how the personality image of the Northwoods Logger : compares to the Marlboro Cowboy and the WINSTON Candid i  smoker.  Summary Of Findings  In terms of campaign communication, it appears that the Major gain accomplished by the new campaign relative to Candid is communication  GN Net peer #  of a more fully dimensionalized, rugged, masculine smoker imagery. The smoker imagery communicated by the new campaign is much richer than that communicated by Candid and tends to be comparable to that communicated by the Marlboro campaign. Given the greater involve- ment of the Northwoods Logger campaign respondents in smoker imagery, the taste communication for the new campaign is somewhat lower than that generated by Candid. However, taste communication for the o Northwoods Logger campaign.is superior to that achieved by the ol Marlboro campaign. .  ~  a) Pad oO oO 0 __label__Letter

Tarazi Mailman Research Center McLean Hospital Harvard Medical School 115 Mill St.  Belmont, MA 02178  Dear Frank:  This letter is to indicate my enthusiastic willingness to collaborate with your group on your current exciting project to examine the localization and regulation of neurotensin receptors and their interactions with the dopamine receptors.  As you know, we have made significant progress in characterizing the behavioral and physiological effects of antisense oligonucleotide administration to knock down each dopamine receptor subtype. These rats will be made available to you, and should be useful in examining the long-term effects of neurotensin on different dopamine receptors.  All best wishes and success in obtaining funding for your project. Yours sincerely,  Tan Creese Ph.D. Professor and Co-Director __label__Letter

Jones  SUBJECT: “MINUTES OF MARCH 10, 1982 P.D.C. MEETING  The following paragraphs summarize our discussions:  1. SALES REVIEW - Our 1981 experience with the A.I.D. program and a comparison of it with the newly announced Philip Morris program were discussed. Other competitive activities reviewed included Brown and Williamson's Plan I Bonus program and additional give-aways; R. J. Reynold's seemingly endless spending spree including the 10% bonus for exclusive Plan II's, the K-Mart  exclusive pack sales deal, and increased payments for out-of- home.  2. ESTABLISHED BRANDS - Advertising flighting schedules for all brands were reviewed. The decision to promote NEWPORT RED in two, rather than the previously. announced: six markets, was an- nounced; as was the upgrading of Florida, Texas, and California to core status on NEWPORT parent later this year. Also reviewed were the new promotion plans for parent KENT utilizing the spring-summer-fall events.  Discussions on TRUE centered mainly on the application of the laser technology and the apparent success of the new marketing  ‘activities. The GOLDEN LIGHTS ULTRA and MAX SLIM LIGHTS projects  were reviewed.  3. NEW BRANDS - Heritage has been withdrawn from the Jackson  market; support will continue in Lexington where a 0.47% S.0O.M. currently exists. REBEL continues to perform very well in Erie and fair in Roanoke. Possibilities of a box packing and also a metro area test will be two topics for discussion at the "next-  steps" meeting to be held in three or four weeks. An up-date is attached.  The SATIN CONCEPT/PRODUCT TEST results were reviewed and everything looks extremely promising for this brand.  TOS9vL28  TER SSPE BEM rte  eg ew hein nite FERRITE DEE  LRQA EOD vee __label__Memo

rete  Lorillard     MEMORANDUM October 3, 1984 TO: A. B. Hudson FROM: E. P. Farrell RE: KENT 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84) - TEST SUMMARY  Two LT products have recently been put through the Starch National Smokers Panel, they are:  - Marlboro Lts. 100's = Kent 2000 100's (9mg.) (#1464-84)}  The Kent 2000 product is different from the 12 mg., PM taste alike or the 12 mg. sweet product evaluated through consumer product testing. The Kent 2000 product (#1464-84) is closely associated with the 12 mg. PM taste alike, however.  As a possible diagnostic aid the Kent M2 product was explored, once again.  To review all three products were paneled among samples of 246 Lo-Fi/LT smokers. All three samples were balanced to provide equal representation of the following dimensions:  - Age  - Sex  - Region  - Regular Brand by Packing  CONCLUSIONS  ti The Kent 2000 100MM product (#1464-84) demonstrated notable deficiencies relative to Marlboro Lts. 100's on most measures including:  - Average satisfaction ratings - Purchase likelihood - Satisfaction relative to current brand  - Product directionals  e These lapses in Kent 2000's performance spanned most relevant user groups: Lo-Fi/LT, 85's/100's and manufacturers. The one exception was Kent 2000's greater satisfaction rating among Kent smokers than that achieved  by Marlboro Lt. 100's.  TISEGSL8 __label__Memo
W. ALTON JGNeS CELLSCIERCe CENTER  Leonard FE. Benade, Ph.D. Grant #1719  Description: Dr. Benade proposes to isolate and characterize a gene which suppresses the action of the oncogene Kirsten RAS. He will do this by first isolating human cells, HOS, with two copies of RAS so that mutants which lose oncogenecity will not be due to loss of RAS. He will then look for revertants which no longer express the transformed phenotype after mutagenesis. He will partially select for such cells using oubain. Revertants are more resistant. He will check these revertants for rescuabable virus, inability to grow in agar and inability to produce tumors in nude mice. Such cells will be fused with mouse NIH 3T3 cells which have been transformed with Kirsten sarcoma virus. Hybrids with suppressed oncogenecity will be selected with oubain. Since human chromo- somes are preferentially lost in mouse-human hybrids, the suppressed cells should with time have Tess and less human DNA. Human DNA will be isolated from such cells, using alu sequences as a probe. This DNA will be used to transfect Kirsten transformed mouse cells and suppressed cells will be selected with oubain. Dr. Benade expects to eventually clone the suppressor gene.  Critique: The idea is a good one and the isolation of a gene which sup-. presses an oncogene will add greatly to our understanding of carcinogenesis. He has a very good publication record. Overlap with pending NIH application should be examined.  Recommendation: Approval - Merit A.  Ae H, Sato, oz por  50244186 __label__Report

Biochem. 224, 1-10 (1994) © FEBS, 1994  Expression, cytoskeletal utilization and dimer formation of tropomyosin derived from retroviral-mediated cDNA transfer Metabolism of tropomyosin from transduced cDNA  Gaddamanugu L. PRASAD, Rebecca A. FULDNER, Richard BRAVERMAN, Elwood MCDUFFIE and Herbert L, COOPER Cell and Molecular Physiology Section, Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, USA  (Received February 21, 1994) — EJB 94 0250/1  _ Expression of the tropomyosin-1 isoform was enhanced by cDNA transfer in non-transformed murine 373 fibroblasts and also in v-Ki-ras transformed fibroblasts in which native tropomyosin-1  expression had been reduced and tropomyosin-  2 synthesis virtually eliminated by action of the  oncogene. The level of synthesis of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 was similar in normal and trans- formed transductants (3-5 times normal levels). The high level of insert-derived tropomyosin-1 expression resulted in a considerable increase in tropomyosin-1 utilization in the cytoskeleton of transformed cells, but this expression still did not reach normal levels, suggesting an oncogene- related inhibition of tropomyosin utilization. A large proportion of newly synthesized native tropo- myosin-1 in normal, unmodified fibroblasts appeared in homodimers which, upon prolonged incuba- tion, were largely converted to the heterodimers. Excess tropomyosin-1 derived from the inserted cDNA also appeared largely as the homodimer in both normal and transformed cells. This homodi- mer was utilized effectively in the formation of cytoskeletal structures but was partially converted  to heterodimer by chain exchange. Under steady: toskeletal tropomyosin-1-containing dimers were  -state conditions, approximately 33% of the cy- homodimers, compared to approximately 10% in  normal fibroblasts. The results show that the increased amounf of tropomyosin-1 homodimer enter- ing the cytoskeleton under conditions of tropomyosin-i excess, results in an atypical microfilament composition. The effect of this excess of tropomyosin-1 homodimers on stability or function of microfilament fibers remains to be determined. The results also confirm that the mechanisms of  rapid homodimer formation with conversion to vitro studies, also occur in vive.  The synthesis of several microfilament-associated pro- teins, including tropomyosin (Cooper et al., 1985), vinculin (Raz and Geiger, 1982, Fernandez et al., 1992), a-actinin (Gluck et al., 1993), and gelsolin (Vandekerckhove et al., 1990) have been reported to be suppressed in neoplastically transformed fibroblasts. Among these, tropomyosin has been extensively studied.  Tropomyosins are a family of ubiquitous actin-binding proteins with extensive a-helical structure that play a well- defined role in muscle contraction (Leavis and Gergely, 1984; Payne and Rudnick, 1985, Lees-Miller and Helfman, 1991), In non-muscle cells, the role of tropomyosins is less clearly understood, and it is generally thought that they are involved in stabilization of actin microfilaments which, in tum, play an important role in maintaining cell shape, motil-  Correspondence to G.

The terminology of tropomyosins used in this study is one in general use for tropomyosins expressed in fibroblasts (Lea- vitt et al., 1986). Tropomyosins-1—3 correspond, in increas- ing order of electrophoretic mobility, to the high-M, tropo- myosins (284 amino acids), which are homologous to tropo- myosins expressed in muscle cells, while tropomyosin-4 and tropomyosin-5 correspond to the low-M, tropomyosins (247 or 248 amino acids) characteristic of non-muscle cells. The reader is also referred to footnote 2 of Lehrer and Qian (1990) regarding the terminology of smooth muscle tropo- myosins. A number of studies have shown that down-regula- tion of expression of the high-M, tropomyosin isoforms con- sistently accompanies neoplastic transformation of murine and avian fibroblasts by a variety of retroviral oncogenes, chemical mutagens and transforming growth factors (Hen- dricks and Weintraub, 1981; Leonardi et al., 1982; Matsu- mura et al., 1983; Hendricks and Weintraub, 1984; Cooper et al., 1985, 1987; Leavitt et al., 1986).

Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Dr. C. L. Ellis ) Date: August 25, 1998 From: A. I. Goldsmith YS  4 Subject: The Merit story  When Merit was launched in 1976, part of the promotional activities included a whirlwind tour by Dr. Ikeda touting the scientific breakthrough that enabled the creation of a low delivery cigarette with a full flavor taste; other researchers also spoke to the press, including Bill Dunn, Walt Gannon, and Hel- mut Wakeham. Based on the news reports —- some of which are enclosed — I pieced together a possi- ble sequence to account for a reference to nine years of research in light of the fact that the quest for a flavorful low tar cigarette goes back at least to 1958 [C58-00972; 1]. Actually, most news stories say  twelve years, which probably dates to the 1964 Surgeon General’s report. Interestingly, however, C75-01560 lists HTI test codes for high burley blends similar to the Timer blend so as to be able to substantiate claims that work had been continuing for seven years.  It would appear that Dr. Ikeda’s clock started ticking at about the time a research program began at the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute (IITRI) of which Philip Morris was a sponsor.  Philip Morris first got involved with TRI in 1965 [C65-03108], when looking into electrostatic filters. ! Then in 1968, along with Airkem, Armour & Company, Gillette, Givaudan, Glidden-Durkee, S. C. Johnson & Company, Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble, Rexall Chemicals, and Vick Chemical, Phi- lip Morris began jointly sponsoring a research program on odor characterization and measurement headed by Andrew Dravnieks. Progress reports from IITRI [2-12] refer to olfactometers, and of course gas chromatography was relied upon heavily, both of which correspond with the terminology in Ikeda’s presentations. When the initial three year program concluded, Philip Morris signed on as a co-sponsor of a two year follow-up program.  More significantly, Philip Morris assisted in a study on the determination of odor components in tobacco smoke, which was sponsored by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Con- ditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Phase I [9 and 13] found GC peaks correlating with likely contributors to tobacco odor, and Phase Il used mass spectrometry to identify most of the constituents [11]. Although the commercial cigarettes used were Winston, Philip Morris provided 1R1 Reference Cigarettes for use; some cigars and pipe tobaccos also were studied. In addition, PM R&D experts assisted in the identification of some ambiguous mass spectra. There was supposed to have been a Phase IIT geared to creating a tobacco odor simulant for room ventilation studies by mixing the most important constituents identified in Phase II, but I have not found a copy of a Phase III report.  The Phase II report is significant, because later in 1974 one sees the first indications in internal docu- mentation of the identification of odor-intense smoke constituents with the goal of using some to add flavor to a low delivery product [IR74-089 and C75-05631]. The major discontinuity in this sequence is that TRI’s compounds seem to relate more to room odor or even to stale odor than to the flavorful odor of fresh mainstream smoke. The urgency of Project Timer seems to have left little time for writ- ten documentation other than in laboratory notebooks, so it is difficult to determine how, when, and by  ' Probably because the Surgeon General's Report discussed the charge on smoke particles.  bSP8TS090Z __label__Memo

' Frem:  Date: Subject:  Ta:  2083204707 Page 1 Note for Smith, Dee Smith, Dee Wed, Nov 24, 1993 2:09 PM COLLECTOR'S CHOICE VERNON CHEEK Hi, Vernon,  As the Collector's Choice saga becomes more confusing, I feel compelled to document a portion of it lest we become overwhelmed by superfluous details.  Originally, we were going to add Red Express to the Skyline Series of  C. Choice. We had agreed that the only change to the case UPC would be  the alpha letter "A" in place of the zero in code 1950. This application  of alphas would change with each new pack replacement in the carton series. (Are we together so far?) Red Express was to be added to the Skyline Series. That, however, was yesterday. Today, 11/24/93, Red Express is being added to the Vista Series (code 1690). This change is being made because the Princeton University is being adversarial about the use of the Princeton name on a pack of cigarettes.  As I remember our conversation prior to your vacation, this change from the full flavor series to the lights series doesn't matter in trademark names. So it's perfectly all right for us to switch the series in which the Red Express brand will appear. As I see it, this means that the 1690 code with now become 169A. This will represent the new Vista carton which will lose Princeton and gain Red Express and so on and so on and so on.  This has been a great catharsis and you are a wonderful sounding board. Hope you enjoyed your vacation.  Dee __label__Email

THE 1986 BERNARD B. BRODIE AWARD LECTURE  The Genetic Regulation of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes  DANIEL W. NEBERT  Chief, Laboratory of Developmental Pharmacology, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health  I feel very honored, indeed, and also very humble, to have the privilege of joining my four esteemed colleagues (1-4) in being named as recipient of the fifth Bernard B. Brodie Award in Drug Metabolism. I thank the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (administrators of this award) and the CIBA-GEIGY Corp. (sponsors of this award) for their recognition of my studies on the genetic regulation of drug- metabolizing enzymes. My training began in the laboratories of Howard 5. Mason, and then Harry Gelboin, who both helped me in choosing the direction of my future studies. I am thankful for my association during the subsequent 18 years with numerous talented colleagues and collaborators without whose skill, hard work, creativity, and continued support and friendship the work lam about to describe would not have been possible. Although their contributions are well documented in the literature, there are several individuals whose contributions are not. One of these is Ernst Caspari, in 1959 with The Department of Biology, Wesleyan University, Middletown CT, who inspired me to think that “there can be little sense to biology, except in the context of genetics and evolution.” Two others include Mort B. Lipsett, previous Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD), and Arthur S. Levine, Sci- entific Director of the NICHHD, who helped create the environ- ment needed for the pursuit of innovative basic research. The other individual is my wife, Kathleen Dixon, who has critically reviewed many of my publications since 1981, and who gave birth to two beautiful, healthy twin boys the same day that John Schenkman informed me of my being recipient of the Brodie Award.  This paper is directed at the graduate student and beginning postdoctoral fellow. I wish to illustrate the chain of events in my career—how the thinking in my laboratory led to the design of an experiment, and how our interpretation of new data led to the next hypothesis. At each point in time, of course, develop- ment of the next experiment was heavily influenced by the prevalent thinking, the skill and creativity of my postdoctoral fellows and collaborators, and the techniques available.  Genetic Locus Defined, The metabolism of carcinogenic poly- cyclic hydrocarbons, such as benzo[a]pyrene, was known 2 dec- ades ago to be carried out by a P-450 enzyme, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH).' We had found that it was possible to study in cell culture the regulation of AHH activity—including induc- tion by benzo[aJanthracene, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D (5-9). The induction, by polycyclic hydrocarbons, of an enzyme that metabolized polycyclic hydrocarbons, seemed very exciting because of its relevance to human environmentally caused cancer  This paper is dedicated to the memory of Mort B. Lipsett (1921-1985), whose enthusiastic support as a friend and administrator | shall never forget.  " Abbreviations used are: AHH, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase; BP, benzo[a] pyrene; MC, 3-methytcholanthrene; TCDD, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; UDPGT,, UOP-glucuronosyitransferase; NMOR,, NAD(P)H:meadione oxido reductase; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism.  and toxicity. The induction of an enzyme by many of its sub- strates also appeared to be very important in fundamental studies of eukaryotic gene regulation.  A survey of AHH inducibility among several inbred mouse strains (10) therefore “seemed like a neat idea” for several rea- sons. (i) As Severo Ochoa noted, “All things being equal, it is better to have a biologic mutant than not to have a biologic mutant.” {ii} In 1969, carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and toxicity were just beginning to be measurable in tissue culture. The intact mouse thus promised to be a better model for the study of pathophysiologic effects of environmental chemicals. (iii) The observations of genetic differences in the mouse can most likely be extrapolated to human disease caused by the metabolism of environmental carcinogens and toxic chemicals, A survey of several inbred mouse strains (10) revealed a fundamental differ- ence (table 1) between C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice. 3- Methylcholanthrene (MC) treatment increased hepatic AHH activity more than 6-fold in B6 but not D2 mice. A 2-nm spectral shift in the reduced P-450-CO complex was also seen in MC- treated B6 but not D2 mice. The B6-D2 difference was not observed following phenobarbital treatment. One interpretation of the table 1 data is that MC treatment of B6 but not D2 mice might lead to the appearance, or large increase, of at least one new P-450 protein; alternatively, MC might cause a decrease in one or more other proteins, unmasking an already existing P- 450 protein in B6 but not D2 mice. Why does the B6 mouse, when presented with a polycyclic hydorcarbon stimulus, respond with an increase in polycyclic hydrocarbon metabolism while the D2 mouse does not? The rest of my career to date has been devoted to gaining a better understanding of this observation.  We first wondered what would happen if the genetically “re- sponsive” B6 mouse were crossed with the genetically “nonres- ponsive” D2 mouse. The lack of AHH induction was found to be inherited as a Mendelian autosomal recessive trait (11) [al- though the inheritance of this trait appeared to be more compli- cated when we studied crosses between other inbred mouse strains (12)]. Moreover, inheritance of this trait was found in  TABLE 1  Aryl hydrocarbon (benzofajpyrene) hydroxylase (AHH) from liver microsomes of control and drug-treaied mice  AHH Specific Activity x        Sean Col 3-Methylcholanthrene* Phenobarbital’ ¢CO-reduced) pmol/min}mg protein am B6 400 450 2500 448 1000 450 D2 400 450 400 450 1000 450     * Eighty mg per kg of body weight for 2 days.

Gretcu*, STEPHEN L. SturLey*, Paut D. Friesent. Nancy E. Beckacet,  AND ALAN D. Attre*$  “Departments of Biochemistry and Comparative Biosciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706: ‘Institute of Molecular Virology and Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madisoa, Madison, W1 53706, and #Department of Entomology. University of California-Riverside,  Riverside, CA 92521  Communicated by Donald F. Steiner, July 1, 1991 (received for review March 18, 1991)  ABSTRACT — Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a ligand for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and mediates the catabolism of several classes of lipoprotein particles, Binding of apoE to the LDL receptor requires association of apoE, with lipid in a vesicle or a lipoprotein particle. Because of this requirement, purified apoE or apoE derived directly from bacterial expression systems does not bind to the LDL receptor. To overcome this problem and to facilitate analysis of apoE structure, recombinant baculoviruses containing the human apoE cDNA fused to the polyhedrin promoter of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus were constructed, The recombinant viruses were used to infect larvae of the tobacco horaworm Manduca sexta in vivo. High levels of lipoprotein particles containing human apoE were present in the he- molymph of infected larvae. In contrast to apoE produced by recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells in vitro, these particles were excellent ligands for the LDL receptor.     Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one of two known ligands for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (1). It provides the specificity required for the receptor-mediated clearance of certain classes of lipoproteins. Genetic variation at the apoE locus that results in defective receptor binding is associated with hyperlipoproteinemia and accelerated coro- nary heart disease (1).  Although apoE is water-soluble when stripped from its lipid milieu, binding of apoE to the LDL receptor requires association of apoE with lipid in a vesicle or a lipoprotein particle (2). Thus, previous studies relating the structure of apoE to its function have relied upon denaturation followed by in vitro reconstitution of apoE with lipid (3). An alternative approach to the production of biologically active apoE would be to express this protein in a system that facilitates lipid association in vivo.  In vertebrates, neutral lipids are transported in association with lipoprotein particles. This process is conserved in in- sects, such as the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (4, 5). Insect lipoproteins, like their mammalian counterparts, have a core of nonpolar neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of amphiphilic lipids (6). The insect apolipoprotein, apoli- pophorin III, has an amphipathic a-helical secondary struc- ture (7), a motif suggested to play a role in the lipid binding of mammalian apolipoproteins such as apoE (8).  In insect larvae, the fat body is the site of synthesis of hemolymph lipoproteins (9) and is also a target of infection by baculoviruses (10). Therefore, we hypothesized that this in vivo system could be exploited to produce recombinant lipoprotein particles containing the products of heterologous     The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

Such recombinant lipoproteins might have similar biological properties to native mammalian lipo- proteins. In the present study, recombinant baculoviruses possessing a human apoE cDNA in place of the polyhedrin gene were constructed. After infection of M. sexta larvae, high concentrations of human apoE were secreted into the hemolymph in a lipid-associated and biologically active form.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses. A 1.2-kilobase- pair (kbp) EcoRI~HindIIl fragment encoding the apoE-3 cDNA from plasmid pHES3 (11) was tailed with BamHI linkers (Promega) and cloned into the BamHI site of pAcYM1 (12), yielding pAcE3. An Aart II-Hinfl 1.1-kbp fragment corresponding to the apoE-3V cDNA from pHAE813 (13) was ligated into the Sma I site of pBluescript M13+ (Strat- agene), An 8-bp BamHI linker (Promega) was then inserted at the EcoRV site of this plasmid to produce p52-Bam. The 1.1-kbp BamHI] fragnent from p52-Bam was ligated into the BamHI site of pAcYM1, yielding pAcE3V. The resulting plasmids were cotransfected with the wild-type baculovirus genome [Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV)] into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-21 cells. Recombi- nant viruses encoding apoE-3 and apoE-3V (AcNPV-E3 and AcNPV-E3V, respectively) were selected, plaque-purified, and titered as described (14, 15).  Infection of Cultured Insect Cells and Insect Larvae, Viruses were used to infect 4 x 10° Sf-21 cells per dish ata multiplicity of infection of 10. SF-900 (GIBCO) medium (2 ml) was harvested from infected cells 42 hr after infection. Fourth- instar larvae (day 2; average mass, 0.5 g; reared as described (16)] were injected with 1 x 10° plaque-forming units (pfu) of recombinant virus and administered a booster with 5 x 10° pfu the following day. Hemolymph was collected 6 days after infection and diluted 1:2 (vol/vol) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mM NaCi/2.8 mM KCI/1.5 mM KH, PO,/6.5 mM Na2HPO,, pH 7.4) containing § mM glutathione, 0.002% phenylmethylsuifonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mg of benz- amidine per ml (PBSI). Media and hemolymph samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate /10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE) (17). Immunoblotting (18) was performed with anti-human apoE monoclonal antibodies 1E and 13E (19) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti- rabbit IgG (Sigma).

Ns PHILIP MORRIS U. S. A.  he Dev?) INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  To:  From:  Subject:  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  Mr. F. L. Daylor bate: June 22, 1979 L. H. Davis  Urea Replacement Program-~Preliminary Outline  While working with Dr. Swain on the RL improvement project, we tried various valeric acids, both alone and in combinations, at several levels. We also tried them as their ammonium salts to increase their solubilities to give more uniformity as well as to give a source of ammonia. Because of the low level of those salts that can  be used to give the optimum taste effect, very little ammonia is added to the filler.  While in Argentina, I injected some of their Marlboro cigarettes with ammonium hydroxide on the last day there. Those who smoked the injected cigarettes agreed that the cigarettes were smoother, more salivating, and tasted more like our U.S. Marlboros. As this was tried my last day in Argentina, we could not explore it any further, but it seemed to confirm my thinking that some of the better taste of RCB compared with RL may be due to the presence of ammonia or compounds Formed that will generate ammonia on pyrolysis.  On my return we tried ammonium acetate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium carbamate, and ammonium lactate in #544 blend Marlboro cigar- ettes containing no urea in the RL. The ammonium carbonate and ammonium acetate were harsher and drier tasting while the ammonium carbamate and ammonium lactate were smoother and more salivating.  Dr. Swain requested pilot plant samples of RL made with the carbamate and lactate salts. We should also evaluate samples made with these salts incorporated in the aftercutting solution to compare the retention of the ammonia on the filler when added at the end of the processing versus that when incorporated in the RL.  If the samples made by incorporating the salts in the sheet or the aftercutting solution confirm the positive results obtained by injection, we should screen the ammonium salts of other organic acids such as gluconic, tartaric, pectic, malic, citric, etc., which have FDA GRAS Status. Even ammonium salts of some amino acids should be screened,  although glycine may be the best one from cost and availability consider- ations.  We should review all past work done on RCB to determine what reaction products containing ammonia and/or nitrogenous compound precursors are generated in the production of RCB. If such information is not available, we should initiate a study to give us that information. We should also compare the nitrogen-containing pyrolysis products of RCB with those of RL with and without urea, ammonia, and various ammonium salts. Such studies should give us clues as to whether it is ammonia and/or reaction products generated during pyrolysis which give the better taste to RCB over RL.  CEPPSTLSOZ __label__Memo

The disclosure list would be extraordinarily long =~ and probably would not fit on a label. I know of no “product where such a complete disclosure is required, _However, there are countries where limits are set for pesticide residues, for example, and as long as the limits are not exceeded, the product is acceptable and. no disclosure is required.

© REASON FOR NOMINATION: % (SPECIFICALLY describe why your nominee(s) deserve the award you a are recommending.) _*  | BELIEVE THIS PERSON (OR TEAM) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THE AWARD BECAUSE: INTRODUCTION  Fibrous glass has been perceived by some as potentially of toxicological significance. Product prototypes of XDU utilize a special form of fibrous glass in their manufacture. To assure that no significant amount of fibrous glass can be transferred to the XDU mainstream smoke, scientists in the Toxicology Division and the Regulatory and Scientific Affairs Division established a program to measure mainstream fibrous glass transfer. The implementation of this  program by Mr. Jerry Avalos, Mr. Keith Shreve and Mr. Guy Spence Is the basis for their consideration as recipients of the "China Breaker Award”:  THE PROGRAM  The program to measure the fiber transfer in mainstream XDU smoke requires many steps. The principal steps include:  1) identifying and preparing standards of fibrous glass to be used in assessing the efficiency of transfer in each phase of the smoke collection effort, 2) identifying and implementing an appropriate smoke collection system compatible with the endpoints to be measured and 3) identifying and utilizing a quantitative technique for counting  the fibers that may be transferred in the smoke. Each of these principal steps is comprised of many smaller, but significant efforts as well.  At the time of program initiation, a timeline was agreed upon that was based on management's best scientific understanding of the problem and the need for a rapid response. Jerry, Keith and Guy understood that they would be under significant pressure to meet the goals of the program from day-one, and were, of course, willing to give  their best efforts. Everything was outlined and work could proceed as planned. This is when the story becomes interesting.  WHY A "CHINA BREAKER AWARD"  Jerry, Keith and Guy knew from conversation with management that the earlier the program could be completed the better for the Company in a number of areas. Rather than just conduct the study as outlined, they discussed the program among themselves and identified several alternative approaches that just might be faster, less expensive, and less labor-intensive. They chose an alternative approach and went to work to demonstrate its potential.  Rather than employing scanning electron microscopy to visualize and count the fibers that may be collected in the  fiber transfer studies, they chose to use polarized light microscopy with an interface to a video tape recorder and television monitor. This approach was validated by the team and proved to be very advantageous.  The advantages include:  1) The elimination of sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy, an effort that required about an hour per sample;  2) A reduction of time for sample quantitation from four hours to 20 minutes per sample;  3) The elimination of a major dependency on sophisticated instrumentation (SEM) with a high demand for utilization on many high priority company programs;  4) Eliminated subsequent project interruptions for those other programs within the Company that depend on the availability of scanning electron microscopy;  5) A reduction in labor necessary to provide the data of interest;  6) A permanent record could be developed to demonstrate the quantification process for each sample on video tape.  0998S 2LeIS __label__Report

Graduate Student Symposium Committee Porter Biosciences Building  Campus Box 347  Boulder, CO 80309-0347 .  (303) 492-2259 - :  email: smohr@beagle.colorado.edu_ .  October 31,1995  Dear George Hashim,  The graduate students in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology are hosting a symposium entitled: Pattern and Polarity: Establishing Difference in Development. It will be held April 12-14, 1996.: This symposium will explore the ways both:single celled organisms and multicellular organisms establish axes and pattern for asymmetric cell division and embryonic development, and will include discussion of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, algae, nematodes, insects, and vertebrates. This letter is-written to request financial assistance for our graduate student  symposium.  This will be the sixteenth symposium organized by the graduate students in MCD Biology.: A unique feature of this event is that it is organized and run entirely by graduate students from our department. These symposia allow us.to interact with prominent scientists from diverse disciplines one-on-one, and introduce us to. deeper . insights into many important questions facing biologists today. These symposia also | serve to enliven the scientific atmosphere of the region by bringing-prominent biologists from around the world to Boulder,  In the past, the Graduate Student Symposium has been made possible by generous donations from biotechnology companies, from companies that:do business with researchers in the Boulder area, and from others interested in biology. The total cost of. the symposium, the majority of which is used for transportation and lodging of the - speakers, is estimated at 15,000 dollars. Past contributions have ranged from 500 to 3500 dollars. -Any contribution would be greatly appreciated, and acknowledged both at the symposium and in the symposium program which is given to each attendee.  Enclosed please find a tentative schedule for this year’s symposium, as well as schedules from past symposia. A member of the Graduate Student Symposium Organizing . Committee will be contacting you by phone to discuss this request. We-would like to. thank you for your time and effort, and hope that you are as excited about this year’s  symposium as.we are.

With that, Jeffords said that the subject of ETS is addressed in his bill and would be the topic for the first panel, witness Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Charles N. Jeffress. Following the testimony of Jeffress, were two panels that discussed FDA authority. The fourth panel discussed possible compensation models for to administering funds obtained in any tobacco resolution to individuals alleged to have smoking- . related illness. Copies of testimony submitted in writing by the witnesses are attached.  Jeffress related the history of OSHA’s proposed rulemaking on indoor air and ETS, noting that ETS contains 4,000 chemicals and compounds, 43 known human carcinogens and that  exposure to ETS is associated with asthma, cancer, lung cancer and heart disease. He urged Congress to do two things:  -Declare a Congressional finding that ETS causes health effects; and  ~Pass legislation on ETS that does not preempt stronger laws.  Jeffress said that if Congress would pass legislation containing ETS provisions then OSHA would not have to issue a final mle, instead the agency would only have to deal with enforcement issues, which could be put into piace in a “matter of months.” OSHA would prefer legislation, according to Jeffress, because the rulemaking process can take four years or longer (“[a major rule can take twice as long if the usual process is followed]”) and then faces protracted  L Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens or “PAST Act”  0001880.01  Me  066e19ZL02 __label__Memo

ys  INDICES OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY WHICH WILL BE MEASURED:  A) Circulating Lymphocytes 1) Chromosomal aberrations 2) Sister chromatid exchanges  B) Urine 1) Mutagenicity in the Ames bacterial mutation assay  RATIONALE: The assessment of adverse biological activity is an important aspect of product development. While important preliminary information can be, and due to ethical considerations must be, obtained from in vitro systems and animal models the ultimate species of interest is the human being. Thus, measuring biological activity in human beings following exposure to the agent of interest is an integral part of safety assessment. Traditionally, urine and blood cells(lymphocytes) from exposed human beings have been used to assess exposure to biologically-active materials. These techniques are the two most widely used methods for assessing biological activity in human beings and have  been used by scientists around the world to maasure the biological activity of cigarette smoke.  EXPERIMENTAL METHODS SUBJECTS: Number of groups = 33 one non-smoking control group and two test groups Subjects per group = approximately 25 Coe  “2 Sex = each group should be one-half male, one-half female ~ Age = 21 to 654 each group must be matched for age 7 Health = all potential subjects should be in good physical condition with no recent history of bacterial illness  subjects which contract a bacterial illness during the study .  should be dismissed putt< | Drug use = all subjects must refrain from drug use during the study.

M E PROPOSED Tl  The proposed resolution, which would be implemented through legislation and a binding contractual protocol to be entered into by participating members of the tobacco industry, mandates a total reformation and restructuring of how tobacco products are manufactured, marketed and distributed in the United States:  (1) by seeking to prevent underage access to, and dramatically reduce underage use of, tobacco products;  (2) by confirming the Food & Drug Administration’s authority to regulate tobacco products under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, with certain provisions applicable to tobacco products;  ( (3) by mandating changes in the corporate culture of tobacco companies; -  (4) by setting national requirements limiting smoking in public places (with State and local governments remaining free to set more stringent requirements),  (5) by requiring that the participating members of the tobacco industry pay hundreds of billions of dollars to fund medical research; public education; cessation programs; health-care costs incurred by federal, state and local governments; and federal and state enforcement of the restrictions imposed by the proposed resolution;  (6) by preserving the rights of individuals to sue the tobacco industry;  (7) by ensuring that members of the tobacco industry who seek to avoid the strictures of the new regime will be held fully accountable for any injuries their products may cause; and  (8) by establishing a comprehensive regime of federal regulation and federal and state enforcement to implement these requirements.  The principal details follow. 1. Prevention of Underage Use of Tobacco Products  The proposed resolution strikes at the core problem of underage consumption of tobacco products. The Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other public health authorities have concluded that virtually all new consumers of tobacco products are under legal age. The proposed resolution attempts to cure what the FDA has termed a “pediatric disease” by drastically curtailing advertising and marketing practices that have been criticized as appealing to minors; by imposing strict controls restricting the sale of tobacco products to adult consumers only; and by requiring dramatic reductions in the levels of underage use, with the tobacco  I  689604150 PRODUCED FROM BéW WEB SITE __label__Report

HILTS  ASHINGTON, April 18 - African-American teen-agers have large- ly eliminated smoking  from their lives, while white teen- agers are still taking up the habit at high rates, according to a study re- ported in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.     “This is the singte most interest-  ing change in the use of tobacco in years: the success of black teens,” said Dr. Michael Eriksen, chief of the Office on Smoking and Health at  . the Federai Centers for Disease Con-  trol and Prevention in Atlanta. “We'd like to bottle it and get it to others, but we haven't figured out how to do that yet.”  The trend is striking:  In 1976, Federal surveys of thou- sands of high school seniors around the country showed that both black and white teen-agers smoked at rela- tively high rates: 28.8 percent of whites smoked one or more ciga-  rettes a day in the 30 days before the’  interviews, while 26.8 percent of black teen-agers did so.  But by 1993, only 4.4 percent of black teen-agers took up regular smoking, according to the Institute for Social Research at the Universi-  ty of Michigan, which conducts the  annual surveys for the Government. |  Among whites, the figures remains high, at 229 percent in 1993, the highest it has been since the late  1970's.  According to an article being pub- lished on Wednesday in cancer insti- tute journal, the change is not be- cause of higher cigarette prices or because the teen-agers are using other drugs, but iste to a change in attitude and social norms, said Dr. Sherry Mills, an epidemiologist who conducted group discussions with two dozen white and black teen- agers in each of five cities to deter- mine what was behind the trend. The focus groups met in Los Angeies, Washington, New Orleans, Kansas           How Teoon-Agers Have Changed  Percentage of high schoo! seniors wno smoked one or more cigarettes a day in the previous 30 days.

Dr. Mills wrote in the jaurnai that family and community pressures were persuading young African- Americans not to smoke. For exam- ple, there is a belief that. cigarerte makers are targeting blacks. Refus- ing tc smoke is part of the reaction. Black parents are firm in telling their children nor to smoke, and black teen-agers have aiso changed their idea of a good time, Dr. Mills said.  - “Whereas black kids will go to a party to dance and mingle, white kids definitely will go — and this is their self-reporting — to drink beer and smoke cigarettes. Black kids just don’t see that as fun.”  _ Dr. Eriksen of the disease-controi agency said: ‘We have ‘looked at many possible explanations for it. It     The shift reflects social ‘pressure, scientists say.     is not a function of school perform- ance, or dropout rates or parentai  : income.” In each of those categories,  he said, when the groups were com- pared, the rate of regular smoking  was was two to three times as high -  among white teen-agers as among black teen-agers. . “For example, among dropouts,  the whites are two to three times.  more likely to smoke,” he said.  The lower rate among blacks also.  is not explained by use of other drugs ‘instead of smoking, because black teen-agers have also decreased their use of other drugs, including mari-  juana, alcohol and cocaine, Dr. Erik-.  sen. . He explained: “Blacks seem to be  . turning off the message from ciga-  rette companies that smoking is cool. For blacks, it no longer pro- vides that function. You hear black teens saying smoking’s a white thing.”  He noted that white rock groups and performers like Brad Pitt, Wino- na Ryder and Johnny Depp, contin- ued to glamorize smoking, while biack performers did not.  “Over ail, we are very depressed about teen smoking because we have made no progress over the last 10 years,” he said. “The only bright spot is the black teens. It shows us that we shouldn't be satisfied with more than 20 percent of teens smok- ing. A significant portion of the popu- lation has already got it under 5 percent.” . :  GE6SEGSITNG  er RR TEN __label__News

Sommers  The Council for Tobacco Research, UsSeAs, Inc. 110 East 59th Street  New York, N. Y. 10022  Dear Dr. Sommers:  I would like to clarify some aspects of the Research project which we submitted to the Council for Tobacco Research, in an attempt to demonstrate that our project is directly concerned with an area of cancer research which your organization is interested  in supporting, i.e., the pathogenic mechanisms of oncogenesis and their control, as relates particularly to chemical carcinogenesis.  We feel that the immune mechanism is far more efficient in preventing the develop- ment of malignancies than in destroying well established growing tumors. The develop- ment of many tumors may indeed be considered, at least in part, as the result of failure of the cellular immunity defense against tumor specific antigens. In these situations, either the least antigenic malignant cells may be permitted to grow and thus escape immune defenses, or humoral antibodies may block specific cellular immunity.  Considerable experimental evidence has been obtained in support of the considera- tions described above. As reported by ourselves and Dr. Old several years ago, it is relatively easy to demonstrate the increased resistance to tumor induction afforded by agents which stimulate the immune system, such as BCG but impossible to obtain favorable results with this type of treatment when the tumors are well established.  Our purpose is to devise better methods of enhancing the immunological reactivity of host to weak tumor antigens and better techniques of stimulating selectively cellular immunity while depressing undesirable humoral immunity. Thus we plan to significantly decrease the rate of appearance of tumors induced by chemical carcinogens as well as increase the time after which they appear. We plan to use inbred mice for these studies rather than guinea pigs which we used for our studies on protection against leukemia because the mouse is clearly the animal of choice for these experiments. In addition, parallel with these studies in mice, the appearance of antibody against known viral oncogenic agents can be monitored in the sera of the experimental animals. We propose to use several inbred strains of mice, BALB/c, C572 C3H, and AKR and the following carcinogens, 3-methylcholanthrene and 3,4,~9,10-dibenzpyrene. We plan te paint or inject the carcinogen in graded doses to mice which will be subjected to various pro- cedures desianed to affect the immune system and its reactivity, such as graft vs host reactions, treatment with certain bacteria] extracts that have demonstrable adjuvant effects for cellular immunity. We will then observe the rate of appearance of the tumor in the population.  In conjunction with these experiments, 11 seems important to us to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system manages to reject     50093420 __label__Letter
mo THE NICOTINE'S WHAT MAKES ‘EM SHOKE!  By &. K, Collins  An in-depth look at the primary ingredient that - affeccs your business.  The stimulation from nicotine in tobacco is the main reason that 60 milifon Americans smoke  Numerous other chemicals are present in tobacco suoke, and it ds the interrelationship of a these constituents that provides the total pleasure derived from smoking. But nicotine is  component which provides the physiological stimulation that makes a person a compulsive smoker,  ae renacely, the Surgeon General's report on tobacco and health gave nicotine a clean bili of health,  Tobacco manufacturers regulate the level of nicotine in their products very closely. Costs of tobacce going into a Product and nicotine level of the final product receive top attenti as cigarettes are made. Over a period af time the percentage of nicotine in Products may  vary, but abrupt changes are avoided, Usually it takes a 15% to 20% change for a signifi~  cant part of the public ta detect it. Nevertheless, it's taboo within the industry to make unnecessary changes.     The nicotine level in most best selling cigarettes is currently somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. Some cigarettes are available with much less nicotine, with 28% of the market in 1977 considered low nicotine. ligh-nicotine cigarettes also fail te attract and keep many smokers.  The lack of nicotine in so-called no-nicotine cigarettes has surely played a major role in the downfall of these products.  There's a definite correlation between the level of n&atine in tobacco and its aroma or Pleasing qualities during combustion. Low-nicotine tobaccos usually are weak flavored, Migh-nicotine tobaccos are too strong for most American smokers. When our forefathers ce: to this country they found the Indians smoking high=nicotine (about 10%) tobaccos, The tobaccos vere simply too strong for our people.     “Blending" is the main method used by manufacturers to regulate the desired nicotine level in tobacco products, The basic blend of our cigarettes is composed of four classes of tebacco, each of which has distinct properties. In 1976 the average percentage of each class of tobacco used in cigarettes was: flue-cured, 46%, Burley, 347; Maryland, .22; and imported, 18%. :  Nicotine contributed by the flue-cured portion of the blrad is controlled by using tobacco grown in different years, fron different production areas of the Belt, and from different Stalk positions, Nicotine content of tobacco grown in differcnt years and production areas vaties considerably, It's mainly related to rainfall.  Most of the 60 species of tobacco are very low in nicotine, (We'll define a species as a group of freely interbreeding plants.) Nicotine can be artificially produced, but ta date this process has been cost prohibitive fer commercial use. Kovever, efforts by private companies are currently underway to make synthetic cigarettes with nicotine added,     Buying patterns of companies are influenced by the levels of nicotine of tobacco in inventory as weli as of what is being purchased.

DEP, 8 BY  vil  BUKSIUN MAKSIELLAK     ‘Plane’ Speaking on Cabin Air Quality  The problem of indoor air quality is one of growing concern inter- natlonally. We spoke with Dr, Larry Holcomb, a Michigan biologist who specializes in toxle hazard investi gations for government agencies and industry, about one facet of this prob- lem — cabin air quallty on commer- clal airplanes, Holcomb recently completed a comprehensive study on cabin alr quality that was published in Bavironmental Technology Let- ters, a scientific journal,  Q: What are some of the com- ponents of poor airplane cabin alr quality and their impact?  A: A major factor is low relative humidity, which can drop from 40 to 70 percent to 5 to 10 percent when cold, dry alr is brought into the alr- craft at flight altitude and heated for circulation. This drop can result in eye irritation and dryness of nasal passages and the respiratory tract.  Another factor is ozone brought into the cabin with outside alr. Ozone has been associated with eye discom- fort, chest pain of tightness, breathing difficulty, nasal irritation, persistent coughing and sore throat. The symptoms of these two factors often are mistakenly reported as “allergic” reactions,  Temperature, barometric pressure and turbulence also cause discomfort to passengers. Even piling too much luggage under the airplane seat can contribute to discomfort by blocking ventilation ports,  Q: Is the public aware of what causes discomfort while flying?  At Most passengers are not aware that the ale is as dry as It Is or of pose sible ozone influences. It is very common to blame any discomfort on environmental tobacco smoke be- cause {t is the only thing that you see.  This misperception has been fueled in large part by the publicity sur- rounding any mention of tobacco. In fact, any of the symptoms associated with poor cabin air quality can be caused by low relative humidity, ozone of the other factors f mentioned.  Airlines, at thelr discretion, can provide an active turnover of filtered fresh alr. There's no evidence that environmental tobacco smoke ad- versely affects the health of non- smoking passengers and crew.  Q: Will banning smoking on commercial airlines solve the problemn associated with poor cabin alr quality?  At I don't think it will solve any problems. In fact, it could even prove disadvantageous by providing s false sense of security to the passengers who might believe that because they aren't secing smoke, they are better off, when actually they are not,  Q: What can be done to im- prove cabin alr quality?  As If good ventilation and suffi- clent alr changes are provided, then ventilation should be sufficient. Also, alreraft should be equipped with catalytic converters to remove ozone; those thet are already equipped should be properly main- tained. Some aircraft manufacturers are beginning to bulld aircraft that re- circulate alr. This is more likely to cause a buildup of contaminants.  Focusing on these very real causes of poor cabin alr quailty will go a long wy toward correcting the  t  problem.  Dr. Holvomb ie a vice president of Hob comb avironmental Services, Ofivet, Mich.

This memo will address outstanding issues and thus facilitate wholesale and retail execution of  this test market. The following issues will be covered:  1)  2)  3)  1) Tax Stamping  2) Hand Stamping Allowances  3) Timing of Wholesale/Retail Allowances 4) Retail Distribution Bonus  5) Carton Sleeves  6) POS Materials  7) Other Marketing Support: Advertising Promotion  8) Feedback T in  California has initially rejected the production of a heat transfer stamp; PM USA will do everything possible to expedite development of the stamp, but an agreement has not yet been reached. Until then, the water applied stamp must be used. The state currently has 3mm water based stamps on hand.  Hawaii is a no tax-stamp State.  Hand Stamping Allowance  The current handstamping allowance is $.20 per carton on an ongoing basis. It has come to Brand's attention that this allowance is inadequate to cover the necessary time and labor involved in handstamping with a water based stamp.  The new handstamping allowance for water based stamps only will be $.25 per carton, from Nov. 15 - Dec. 31, 1992. At that date, Brand will re-evaluate the need  for this allowance based on the availability of a heat applied stamp.  Wholesale/Retail Allowances  To ensure proper sell-in, both wholesale and retail allowances have been further extended. Wholesale allowances are extended to Nov, 27, 1992. Retail allowances  are extended to Deg, 15, 1992.  VIRGINIA SLIMS 10 PACK UPDATE. DOC  LEESI6SHOZ __label__Memo

Lervdiard     MEMORANDUM August 6, 1976 - CONFIDENTIAL - TO: Mr. d. R. Ave FROM: R. E. Smith RE: August, 1976 Status Report  Here's how the major work stands.  NEW BRAND DEVELOPMENT  SHF/UHF - Top-line results from quantitative concept evaluation indicate that "50% lower nicotine" has strong potential. We  are starting product and advertising development on this concept. This, along with business/marketing planning, is aimed toward  a 1/77 test market. We plan to select 3 or 4 more concepts  from analysis of the complete data (including - for sure - one menthol SHF concept) during the week of 8/23.  Nowland's first report on their basic work with health-concerned smokers will be made in late August. Their work will be com- pleted in late 1976. We plan to select from Nowland ideas and high technology concepts - and go to in-market evaluation in mid-1977 and beyond.  Perceived Economy - Twelve concepts are being produced for quantitative evaluation. Top-line results will be available  in early October. We plan to be in-market with low technology products during the first quarter of 1977.  Synectics II - Work is proceeding on major projects:  - MRD will shortly recommend how we can best identify (quantify) high-potential cigarette smoking segments; who, why, how many. This is likely to be a long-range study - but we will separate it into Manageable, specific building steps.  - Following discussions with R&D/Operations, MCA will lay out a specific procedure for adding projects to the 5 Year Plan. This procedure will be an expansion of a system that has been established in Greensboro for some time, se  Oa on S w > ” JI nes  Both these projects will be ready for your review in late August. ~~ __label__Memo

Subject:             RJR     Interoffice  New Marlboro 25's Date: July 11, 1984 Re: Mr. G. H. Long's Memorandum Dated 7/2/84  Mr. B. V. Hardin From: D. L. Potter  The technical analysis of the new Marlboro 25's product and packaging is complete with the exception of a thorough blend analysis of Marlboro Light 25's, which will be completed on July 13,  1984, Attached are the results of our analysis with this one exception.  We provide here a summary of the attached results for your review:  The blend analysis on Marlboro King Size 25's showed no significant difference compared to Marlboro 20's product analyzed earlier this year. No difference was found in the tow item, cigarette circumference or percent air dilution. The difference in tip draft and cigarette draft is due to the high variation noted in the samples tested and is not thought to be an intentional change.  The physical and analytical data collected for the Marlboro Light 20's and 25's products indicates there is no difference between these two products. This cannot be confirmed until the blend analysis is complete on July 13.  The major differences between the Marlboro 20's and 25's products are in the packaging. Besides the obvious differences caused by placing 25 cigarettes in a pack and eight packs in a carton, raw material differences were noted. The Marlboro 25's products utilize a 45 lb. base paper in their foil inner liner versus the 28 lb. liner found in the 20's pack, a 65 lb. C1S litho label in place of 55 lb. and .014 inch carton stock in place of .012 inch. Although these upgraded packaging materials may offer some additional packaging stability with rounder less sharp edges on the pack, they may also cause an upcharge in the total packaging cost. This upcharge includes the estimated savings resulting from reduced material requirement. Preliminary packaging cost analysis indicates a minimum 3% upcharge before purchased volume considerations are  taken into account which would significantly impact on the cost of printed items.  The follow-up report will be issued as soon as the Marlboro Light blend analyses are completed.     ul Ss ‘ he 8 rs i) wn a __label__Letter
Leille,  TOBACCO COMPANY  Febmary 2, 1999 MEMORANDUM  TO: Jim Williams ww FM: Valerie M. Vaughan  Strategy Letter: Maverick 3rd Quarter 1999 Workplan Materials Program #: 99-003M  Objective: Provide targeted impactful point-of-sale materials that support  Maverick’s 1999 creative campaign.     Maverick’s “Real Deal” creative campaign will continue for 3rd Quarter workplan materials.  Overall Strategy: Provide a consistent and cohesive family appearance to all workplan point-of-sale pieces that are placed both in and outside the store. As  we begin to build Maverick’s long-term brand identity, all workplan pieces will feature Maverick’s signature Black and Gold colots via:  e Black backgrounds instead of a combination of black and grey backgrounds.  © Maverick’s gold signature icon (either “Maverick” brand name alone or coupled with the triangular logo and falcon).  Where room permits, “The Real Deal” headline will be used. The supporting tagline, “Real Taste, Great Deal”, however, will no longer be used. When this tagline was used on ptevious quarters’ workplans, it connoted mostly a price or value positioning. Without using the tagline, however, allows consumers to draw their own conchisions about the brand, like a great quality product or “a brand of cigarettes that’s for me”.  Additionally, photos of Maverick packs will be featured on all pieces that are intended for placement away from the display (i.e., 2x2 panel holders) to help confirm that Maverick is a brand of cigarettes.  Tactics: e Allold quarterly workplan pieces must be removed and replaced with new 3“ quartet workplan materials.  ® The 4, 6 and 8-wide riser strips that incorporate pricing areas must be used in conjunction with all 4, 6 and 8-wide riser cards.

PROJECT 2302 IMPROVED SMOKE FLAVOR  PERIOD COVERED BY REPORT: August. 18 ~ September 16, 1960 DATE CF REPORT: September 26, 1960 PROJECT LEADER: W. H. Danker  PROPYLENE GLYCOL IN! FILLER FOR SMOKE MILDNESS.  A study has been under way for several months to determine the maximum amount of propylene glycol we could add to fillers without staining the paper. Both Alpine and Philip Morris  cigarettes are being tested - at room temperature and at elevated  temperatures. A range of from 4%. to 8% propylene glycol is  being used in the study, The 8 samples show paper spotting within a month. The 6% samples show a slight amount of spotting on Philip Morris cigarettes. andi frequent spotting on Alpine ciga- rettes in 2 months. The 4% samples show spotting only at 110°F after 1 month; samples stored at 75°F did not spot in 1 month. ,  Analysis of propylene glycol has been recently made relatively much more reliable and show much variation in application of propylene glycol on filler. Therefore future panel studies: will be more meaningful when accompanied by analytical data. Our studies will continue until firm results are determined correlating percentage propylene glycol, spott-~ ing and reduction in irritation,  In the event. that spotting does occur at a propylene @lycol level which is threshold for irritation, Mr. J. W. Geiger has a paper which has shown no spotting at. the higher levels of propylene glycol in filler.  SIMULTANEOUS EVALUATIONS OF FLAVOR. AND IRRITATION  We have completed the first of a basic series of studies on changes of flavor and irritation with changes in concentra- tion of three flavors and of smoke. The four materials selected to show a wide range of difference in flavor and in irritation, were furan, acrolein, anethole and whole Philip Morris cigarette smoke. Sensory evaluation results show strikingly different patterns for each of these materials with change of concentra- tion in air dilutions. Furan's flavor increases. faster than does its irritation with Increasedi concentration. By contrast the reverse is true for acrolein, Irritation inereases faster  Cc C6G-82322  se burtgy ee  et te kode Wl  gogahecen¢ __label__Scientific

ta  TEST OF THE LINEAR-NO THRESHOLD THEORY OF RADIATION CARCINOGENESIS  Bernard L. Cohen University of Pittsburgh  Pittsburgh, PA 15260, U.S.A.  We recently completed a compilation of radon measurements from available sources which gives the average radon level, r, in homes for 1730 counties, well over haif of alt U.S. counties and comprising about 90% of the total U.S. population. Plots of age-adjusted lung cancer mortality rates, m, vs these r are shown in Fig. 1a, c where, rather than showing individual points for each county we have grouped them  into Intervals of r (shown on the base-line along with the number of counties in each  group) and we plot the mean value of m for each group, its standard deviation, and _  the first and third quartiles of the distribution. We-see, in Fig. 1a, c, a clear tendency for m to decrease with increasing r, in sharp contrast to the increase expected from the fact that radon can cause lung cancer, shown by the line labelled "theory". One obvious problem is migration: people do not spend their whole life and receive ail of their radon exposure in their county of residence at time of death.

THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE  1875 | STREET, NORTHWEST SAMUEL D. CHILCOTE, JR. WASHINGTON, DC 20006 President 202/457-4800 * 800/424-9876     October 30, 1992  MEMORANDUM TO: The Members of the Management Committee  FROM: Samuel D. Chilcote, Jr. ow  Enclosed for your review prior to our conference call November 16 are The Institute staff's recommendations for 1993 creative and media buys for the "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" and "It's the Law" print campaigns. These materials include a narrative describing the rationale for the proposed insertion schedule, the new creative work, and the budget. As with all program materials, our audience is adults. By way of summary:     “Tobacco: Helping Youth say No"  Three different creative concepts are included in the 1993 "Tobacco: Helping Youth Say No" print advertising package (Tab 1).  The first, "It's Tough Growing Up," complements the print messages for 1991 and 1992, and continues to dovetail the themes stressed by the television PSAs. This ad has been designed for placement in general consumer books and minority publications, at a budget totaling $694,000 for general consumer (down $256,000 from 1992) and $85,000 for minority media (down $10,000).  A second ad, "Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up," has been designed for decision maker publications and continues to promote both the youth and "It's the Law" components of the industry's youth initiatives. The 1993 budget for decision maker publications is at $291,000 (up $66,000 from 1992).  The third ad, also headlined "Smoking Should Not Be A Part of Growing Up," is designed for the education trade press and is the same ad that began running midway through 1992. Because the educator audience is the peer group of the Family COURSE Consortium members, the Consortium is designated as the sponsor of this ad, made possible by a grant from The Institute. This sponsorship again dovetails the designation carried by the PSAs. A full-year schedule for the education press is budgeted at $25,000 (a $5,000 increase).     LOTS T@cTtsS __label__Letter

Comes pate: July 16, 1985 _L. He Thompson  - Comparison of X6D5BFR (control) to X6D5BFS (test)         Two cigarette types, a control filler sprayed with water (X6D5BFR):;. and a control filler (X6D5BFS) sprayed with an additive (M1004), were submitted for testing in the S/M assay (1). The objective of this. experiment was to determine if a decrease in the amount of M1004 added to the filler from a previous. experi- ment. (2), would show a significant difference between the test sample and the control. Previous. results (2) showed that the control filler + additive had a significantly higher specific activity (S.A.) than control filler + water. Four 6008 (3). smokings of these samples were carried out by members of Charge No. 6908. (3).  The IT CSC's from the replicate smokings (prepared as lOmg/m1i stock solu- tions im DMSO) were tested randomly in strain TA98+S9 according to the: standard procedure (4,5) using doses of 0.05,0.10, 0.15. and 0.20 mg CSC/plate. The control data from this. experiment were within) normal ranges.  Table 1 shows the analysis of variance on the experimental results (performed using "Minitab").. Statistically, there was no difference between the control and the test sample. This result implies that. adding this compound to filler at a lower level may. not have a significant effect on activity. However, iit should be noted! that except for smoking 3,. all of the S.A.s for the test sample were higher than the S.A.s of the control. The: resulting mean S.A. for the test samples would reflect the variation im smoking 3.. Therefore, a repeat experiment and perhaps even more smokings. would be: needed’ to veriify these results. The: average CSC yield/cigarette was the same for each cigarette type  (Table 1). ek Z MLE  cc: Dr. J.. L. Charles Dr. C.K. Ellis Dr. R. N. Ferguson Dr. B.. B. Sanders  4vSb20e  D98 __label__Memo

APR-11-1994 11:51 FROM CandB WASH DC 2026626291 TO P.a2  ONFIDENTIAL  March 22, 1994 MEMORANDUM  Re: — Ingredients Identified by HHS as Used in the  Manufacture of Cigarettes but not Approved  for Use i 1. Ammonia -- Ammonia is used as a processing aid in the production of cigarettes. Greater than 95 percent of the ammonia is recovered for reuse. Only trace levels remain in the finished cigarette. Due to its low boiling point, residual ammonia does not pyrolyze. Ammonia is a natural constituent of tobacco. Several ammonia-containing compounds are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by EDA for use in food, including ammonia hydroxide, mono and dibasic ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium biocarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium chloride (1 C.F.R. §§ 184.1135, 184.1137, 184.1138, 184.1139, 184.1141, 184.1143). Ammonia compounds are approved for use in tobacco by the Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health (the Hunter Committee) in the United Kingdom. . Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance that is produced endogenously by humans at levels far in excess of that delivered in the smoke of a cigarette. Environmental regulatory and reporting requirements applicable to the use, disposal and transportation of significant quantities of ammonia have no bearing on the appropriateness of its use in cigarette manufacture. The Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) workplace exposure limit for ammonia greatly exceeds any leveis  to which smokers would be exposed.  2ILSS26B __label__Memo

Cundari Jeanne Swisher Jim Best Dave Owens 1 Wayne Tucker Jack Geeting Dave Wilmesher Rick Young  Subject: | Casey's General Stores  After many months of negotiations, we finally have a contract signed with Casey's. As you know, back in April, Caseys’ decided to go with P.M. and BAT; however, shortly after that decision was implemented, they realized that to maintain their volume, they needed us on contract as well.  The current backbar setup for cigarettes (see pictures attached) is 8’ long and 8.4’ high. P.M. has 4' or 50% of the setup and is on a base contract at approximately $60. Per month. BAT has the top portion of the other 4’ section or 25%, and has maximized their payment at $400 +. We have the lower half for the remaining 25%, and are on a full  PRP at our current grid rate of $140 per month. Our eight baskets, which is our prime merchandising space, and encompasses the 3-P’s along with the Doral sign outside the box starts at 30” from the floor and goes to 56” from the floor. Based on the average of 8’ from the counter fo the backbar, our space is all very visible.  The reason we decided to take the horizontal position we took was based on the fact that over the last 4 years, Caseys’ volume has remained steady at about 135 cpw, and thus has shown no upside potential. Based on this, we felt our merchandising space was a good buy, and would more than adequately defend our business. Especially when you consider what BAT is paying, and that we would have had to increase our payment by at least $160 per month or $2,304,000 per year to share the top of the 4’ section with them. This just didn’t make good business sense.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  Sincerely,  ae .  Don F. Knoll Account Executive __label__Letter

Landrigan and Homayoun Kazemi     The New York Academy of Sciences New York, New York 199]  Asbestos Fibers Are Mutagenic After Alk: New Signs of Orthodoxy for a Paradoxical Group of Carcinogens  THOMAS M. FASY  Department of Patholugs Mount Sinai School of Medicine New York, New Yark [0029           been ado  of that lime the prevailing view has been thal asbestos fibers do not have a clear genotoxic potential. Since this view is currently undergoing a remarkable revi- sion, this is # lmely occasion to review the matter.  Many studies of carcinogenesis point to the important role of DNA damage and the subsequent processing of the resulting DNA lesions to yield mutations. '“* Indeed, many carcinogens have been identified as mutagens (and vice versa) and mutagenesis assays have been widely adopted as surrogates for use in screening compounds for carcinogenic activity," Nonetheless, there is a growing recogni- tion that the process of carcinogenesis involves more than a series of mutations accumulating in critical genes and that nongenotoxic mechanisms also play an important though poorly understood role in expanding the size of initiated clones and by enhancing the effectiveness of genotoxic carcinogens in other ways.  The situation with asbestos fibers is far from clear. Although there is general agreement about the ability of asbestos fibers to induce aneuploidy “and to cause chromosome breaks and other chromosomal aberrations,''- there is dis- agreement between authors who report that asbestos fibers can increase the fre- quency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), which are considered as a manifes- tation of DNA damage.’*!¥ and uhose who report that ashestos fibers are not able to increase the level af SCEs in treated cells in culture,!!??? Finally, numerous investigators have examined the ability of asbestos fibers to damage DNA or to induce mutations in mammalian cell specific-locus assays, and they report that asbestos fibers have little? or no ability! 3"*-* to cause mutations tn these tests. ‘Taken together, these results have led many to the conciusion thal asbestos fibers are most unorthodox and paradoxical carcinogens and that they may act through mechanisms different from those employed by more familiar carcinogens, such as electrophilic chemicals, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet Hehe  A large part of the controversy surrounding the genotoxicity and the muta- genicity of asbestos is semantic in nature. A mulation is commonly defined as a heritable chanye in the genome .** Therefore, the loss or gain of an entire chromo- some is quite properly regarded as a mutalion, Indeed, since monosomies oF trisomies represent the loss or gain of thousands of genes, they must be consid- ered as enormous mutations. In this regard, it is useful to recall that some of the mutants studied by DeVries (who introduced the term and the concept of muta-  271                                                50523644 __label__Scientific

Philadel shia  Dietary Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation Alters Platelet Size and- Inhibits Human Vitronectin (CD51/CD61) Receptor Expression  Victor L, Serebruany, “Jose V. Ordonez, *William R. Herzog, Morten, Rohde, 7Svend A. Mortensen, {Karl Folkers, and Paul A. Gurbel  Heart Associates Research & Education Foundation, *University af Maryland School of Medicine, Baltinore, Maryland. USA; The National Universin: Hospital (Rigshospital) Copenhagen, Denmark; and Lnstitute for Biomedical Research, University af Texas, Austin, Texas, U.S.A.     Summary: Improved cardiovascular morbidity and mortal- ity have been observed in several clinical studies of dietary supplementation with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, ubiquinone). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the ef- fects of CoQL0, but a comprehensive explanation of its car- didprotective properties is still lacking. One attractive theory links ubiquinone with the inhibition of platelets. The effect of CoQtO intake on platelet size and surface antigens was examined in human volunteers. Study participants received 100 mg of CoQ10 twice daily in addition to their usual diet for 20 days. Receptor expression was measured by flow cy- tometry with monoclonal murine anti-human antibodies CD9 (p24), CD42B 1b}. CD4 1b (I[b), CD61 (Ila), CD41a (Ib/IHa), CD49b (VLA-2). CD62p (P selectin), CD31 (PECAM-1). and CDS1-CD61 (vitronectin), An increase of total scrum CoQ10 level (from 0.6 = 0.1 to 1.8 £03 pg/ml;  p < 9.001) was found at protocol termination. Fluorescence intensity was higher for the large platelets when compared with the whole platelet population. Significant inhibition of vitronectin-receptor expression was observed consistently throughout ubiquinone treatment. Reduction of platelet size was observed at the end of CoQLO supplementation. Inhibi- ton of the platelet vitroncctin receptor and a reduction of the platclet size are direct evidence of a link between dietary CoQ10 intake and platelets. These findings may not be fully explained by the known antioxidant and bioenergetic prop- erties of CoQ10. Diminished vilronectin-receptor expres- sion and reduced platelet size resulting from CoQ 11! therapy may contribute to the observed clinical benefits in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Key Words: Coenzyme Q10—Ubiquinone—Antioxidants—Platelets-—Vitronectin receptor—Flow cytometry—Human.     Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, ubiquinone) is a naturally occurring substance which functions as an electron carrier in oxidative phosphorylation (1). CoQ10 has been observed to promote stabilization of cell mem- branes in vitro and to exert bioenergetic and antiox- idative effects by acting as a free radical scavenger (2). CoQ10 also limits mitochondrial respiratory activity, resulting in a decrease of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (3).  The role of dietary CoQ10 intake in cardiovascular pathophysiology has been increasingly investigated. Although humans can synthesize CaQ10, some pa- tients may be relatively deficient in this substance. Ex- perimental and clinical data provide evidence that CoQ10 supplementation in patients with cardiomy- opathy and chronic heart failure is associated with im- provements in clinical outcome, exercise capacity, and quality of life (4,5). It also has been demonstrated that CoQ10 is beneficial in the treatment of ischemic heart        disease (6). Improved myocardial contractility after CoQ10 supplementation during ischemia—reperfu- sion injury in a swine model also was reported (7), Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of CoQ10, but a comprehensive explanation of its cardioprotective properties is still lacking.  Platelet aggrepation plays an important role in the development and progression of numerous cardiovas- cular diseases (8). Free radicals are established pro- moters of platelet activation and have documented strong proaggregatory properties (9). Moreover. oxy- gen radicals could modulate platelet surface selectin expression (10) and could enhance P selectin—depen- dent platelet-mediated leukocyte rolling (11). Peroxi- dation products stimulate platelet-release factors and activate membrane glycoprotein IIb/Illa (GP IIb Ula) (12). Therefore it is reasonable to expect that one mechanism by which antioxidants may produce clini- cal benefits in patients with cardiovascular diseases is     Received April 15, 1996: revision accepted May 30, 1996.

Hasim  The Council for Tobacco Research-USA, Inc. 900 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022  Dear Dr. Hasim:  | am submitting a grant entitled, "Novel Transcripts Involved In Breast Tumorigenesis". This grant was previously assigned a #4520. The new proposal represents a revised version of the previous grant.  The two reviewers had the following comments on our previous grant (#4520). The first reviewer was extremely enthusiastic abolit our project. He considered the proposed methodology novel, =: predicted that it would be successful, and recommended the projéet for funding. The second reviewer, on the other hand, expressed ; concerns about the P.I.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches. Per the first reviewer's comment, indeed we have successfully used positional cloning approaches and cloned BRCA2 gene as proposed in our previous application. To address the second reviewer's concern about the P.I.'s expertise in positional cloning approaches we have enclosed our latest publication describing cloning and identification of BRCA2 gene. Since the submission of our previous grant application we have cloned the gene, and hence the revised proposal has entirely different emphasis, i.e. to characterize the tumor suppressor activity of BRCA2 gene.  We hope that the reviewers will favorably consider this revised proposal and give the P.I. an opportunity to continue this exciting area of research  Sincerely yours,  Aros poh  Raj Kandpal, Ph.D. Assistant Professor __label__Letter

To: From:  Subject:  PHILIP MORRIS U.S.A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPOKDENCE  RICHMOND, VUERGINIA  Dr. D. A. Lowitz bate: March 26, 1974  N. 8. Rainer  QUARTERLY REPORT  Cigarettes were machine-made from Marlboro filler containing 5, 10-and 20% of a shredded, carbonized filler. Reductions in TPM and CO delivery have been found, confirming data obtained on eight different tests of hand-made cigarettes and an earlier test on machine-made cigarettes. The cigarettes are mild-tasting and do not appear to produce fiery particles.  Hand-made cigarettes were fabricated having a carbon core derived from a laterally crimped cellulosic non-woven sheet. No fiery particles were produced during smoking, and the ash has the same appearance as a control cigarette having no carbon core. This potentially low cost cigarette is expected to provide reduced TPM and gas phase delivery without sacrifice in taste. It could overcome the problem of brittleness encountered with the shredded carbon filler. The cigarettes may also serve as. a research model for investi- gation of combustion phenomena in the cigarette.  Studies continue in our efforts. to correlate the chemistry of smoking substrates. such as burley stems and cellulose, with the nature of the resulting smoke. Using cellulose as a model, it has been discovered that carboxyl groups produced by chemical oxidation of primary hydroxyl groups undergo rapid decarboxylation at low pyrolysis temperature (240°C). It is unlikely that the resultant product can form levoglucosan, the primary initial degradation product of cellulose. This may give some insight into an explanation as to why oxidized cellulose produces milder smoker than untreated cellulose. Other carboxyl groups, such as those produced by air oxidation, are more resistant to decarboxyla- tion. Aside from the informative value of this knowledge, it presents a novel route toward the utilization of most of the Briskin-type oxidized celluloses.  Work continued on providing samples of ozone treated burley stem material to J. Swain for subjective smoking evaluation. Results to date indicate reduced harshness of smoke. Further studies are underway to ascertain the effects of ammonium carboxylate groups in themselves and in combination with reduction of carbohydrate molecular weight. It has been found that the carboxyl content of  69ICCTSOOOT __label__Memo

'2458-93-29650  MEMORANDUM  March 26, 1993 MINIMUM SALES AGE FOR CIGARETTES IN PENNSYLVANIA  This memorandum responds to the February 18, 1993 letter from Richard A. Lewis, District Attorney for Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, to Ernest D. Preate, Jr., Attorney General of Pennsylvania, in which Mr. Lewis requests that the attorney General issue a formal opinion addressing the minimum sales age for cigarettes in Pennsylvania. Mr. Lewis suggests that  Pennsylvania law prohibits the sale of cigarettes to persons  under the age of 21. He notes that Section 6306 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6306, prohibits the sale of cigarettes to "any minor," and that the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa. C.Ss.  § 1991, defines a "minor" as "an individual under the age of 21  years."  In fact, the minimum sales age for cigarettes has been 18 since 1990, when Section 6305 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa. C.S. § 6305, was amended to raise the minimum sales age for “tobacco, in any form," from 16 to 18. The minimum sales age for cigarettes, as for other tobacco products, previously was 16, as  specified in Section 6305 prior to the 1990 amendment.  The District Attorney's reliance on the Statutory  Construction Act is misplaced. That Act itself provides that the  definitions contained in Section 1991 apply only when the context  does not "clearly indicate[ ] otherwise." 1 Pa. C.S. § 1991; see  800881992 __label__Memo

It is a. measurement of the average number of elements correctly identified by respondents after viewing the ad at the threshold exposure (which varies from: .2 to 8 seconds), The Index is computed as follows: Every element. recalled by every respondent is assigned one "point;" in addition, one point each is given for correct brand name and product identification,  All respondents' points are then accumulated, averaged, and expressed as a  percentage. (Elements of an ad consist of headline words or phrases, as well as pictorial elements.)  For example, if a respondent, after threshold exposure, claims to have seen "a pack of True cigarettes and a 5," his answer constitutes five points - one point each for the pack, the word "True", and the "5", and one point each for correctly identifying brand and product. If the average number of elements re-  called by respondents for that ad was 4,86, the Threshold Perception Index would be 486%.  The norm of 400% was developed through correlation of Communicus' pre-testing  and post-test data. (Post-testing estimates the number: of people who have noticed an outdoor ad in the marketplace. } ‘An ad which earns a Threshold Percention  Index of 400% or more is likely to perform well in Conmunicus' post-testing,  te. is likely to be above average in attracting attention under actual viewing conditions. »  It is theoretically possible for an ad to receive no correct brand: identi- fication, but still have a Threshold Perception Index of 400% or more. This is  unlikely since recognition of the brand name is usually worth two "points" in ‘the Index, However, if such a situation did occur, it would probably mean: that  the ad had excellent stopping power, but that it attracted attention with strong, creative elements which had little or nothing to do with the brand itself,  It is important to remember that the Threshold Perception Index is merely  Suggestive of actual performance and must always be evaluated within the context of all findings from the same test,  L.

J. Reynolds are gathering pertinent information that we believe will assist NIP in its determination. That information will be forwarded to you shortly by them.  In the meantime, as you may know, a! federal district court recently vacated the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency’s Report on Environmental Tobacco Smoke that sought to classify ETS as a known human carcinogen. I enclose a copy of the court’s opinion for your review and consideration as the NTP considers listing ETS.  The opinion begins by discussing the procedures Congress had established for EPA to follow in its research program on indoor air quality. The court concluded that EPA fell short of complying with those procedures. The court then, however, reviewed the record to determine whether, “aside from procedural defects” (page 38),| EPA conducted the risk assessment in accordance with the Radon Research. Act... The‘core scientific requirements of the Radon Research Act are  identified as “[g]athering all relevant information, researching, and disseminating findings”  (page 90) arid providing “clear, objective information about indoor air quality” (page 91).

Chronology of Events  On December 4, 1964, The Council for Tobacco Research initiated an expetiment on the effects of chronic exposure to tobacco smoke of populations of mice of various strains, to explore the effect of tobacco smoke when applied directly to the skin of mice as well as to various other organs of other species such as rabbits, rats or hamsters. It also was to support design and construction of a smoking machine. This was financed by a grant of $350,000 in five equal annual installments of $70,000 each to Bio-Research Institute, Inc.  A first smoking machine was designed and constructed by Richard Walton and began to be tested by us on December 2, 1965. Exploratory studies with various modifications of the Walton machine continued to January 1967 when the first group of 100 C57BL/6 mice were subjected to chronic inhalation studies. These were replaced by 200 Millerton Swiss mice in May 1967 because of high mortality among the black mice. A great deal of work was done on acute toxicity of smoke of various cigarettes in mice and a paper was published on this at a meeting of the Society of Toxicology  in 1967.  On November 1, 1967, a patent application for the smoking machine was filed by Richard Walton. On October 1, 1968, we suggested that ''the time had come to decide whether or not the Walton reverse smoker should be universally accepted."' We stated that, based on our experience, we were ready to begin a new chronic exposure experiment. This was based on a review of data on 34 surviving mice exposed five times per week for 55 weeks. Slides of these mice were reviewed by Loosli who called them poor and by Thelma Dunn and Harold Stewart who commented that "the dilatation of the alveolar spaces appears to be excellent, so we judge that your technique for expanding the lungs by the intratracheal instillation of  fixing fluid is satisfactory. "'  From 1968 to 1969 the first large-scale experiment for skin painting with native smoking machine jet condensate was carried out and the lesser activity of fresh smoke was first noted by Bernfeld September 5, 1969.  On November 7, 1969 the use of inbred Syrian hamsters was first sug- gested by us as part of a study of the effects of rodent viruses on tobacco smoke effects then proposed by Dr. Sim of Yale who wished to join us for this work. CTR declined to support this project.  CTR CONTRACTS 005496 __label__Report

Thelr findings will be compared with an age-matched u.exposed control population. The exposed group will tnelude 145 smokers and 55 non-smokers, a number which they belleve will be sufficient to provide prospective assessments of the relationships between AHH Enducibility and the development of disease known to be related to asbestos (lung cancer, and mesotheliomata).  Spectrofluoromet ric methods will be usd for the determination of AHH In cultured lymphoblasts. Studies will be rer-:ated on a sub-sample of the total population. Finally, Dr. Selikoff, a physician with extensive experience with the asbestos problem, will be a participant in the study through the provision of follov-up, presumably over a long perlod of time, on the subjects so that any  correlation between asbestos associated lung disease and AHK fnducibl lity might be determined.  Investigations will be conducted at the Channing Laboratory of the Harvard  Medical School which Is located at the Boston City Hospital. The laboratory facilities appear to be adequate. .  Samples will be collected by Dr. Self koff and his associates and there is a letter Indicating the collabcration acreement with Dr. Selltkoff.

The hypothesis of a mechanism f=  action mediated by a glutathione-dependent phenomenon had to be considered and supports the present ( 2 _7  study using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent specific glutathione depletor via y-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibition’  Animals and methods Pa  Female Swiss mice (25+2g) were given either ADT alone (10 or 100 mg/kg p.o.) or BSO alone (0.5 mg/kg ip.) or BSO (0.5 mg/kgipJ 3h prior to ADT (10 or 100 mg/kg p.o.). Control mice were given saline solution. Mice were sacrificed 5 h after ADT administration (or 8 bh  after BSO administration). Cytosolic reduced (GSH) and ozidized (GSSG) giutathione content and giutathione-related eazyme activities (GSSG-reductase, GSH-peroxidase, GSH-S-transferases) were measured in the liver of treated and control groups.  /  . / urt/g Results and commentaries  1- ADT effect /  Oral treatment of mice with tow dosage of ADT (10 mg/kg) induced an increase in glutathione content, and specially in GSH content. A 10-fold dosage of ADT was no more efficient, that can be due to a feedback competitive inhibition mechanism. There were variations neither in GSSG nor in glutathione related enzyme activities.

This depletion is due to the specific inhibitory effect exerted by BSO on gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and as attempted concerns the reduced glutathione that is synthesized only in cytoplasm.  This effect induced a marked decrease in glutathione-dependent  enzyme activities. such as GSH-peroxidase (33%), GSSG-reductase (30%) or GSH S-transferases (35%).

This protective effect seems to be initiated with the low ADT dosage (10 mg/kg), but was more evident with the high dosage (100 mg/kg), since glutathione content and the glutathione related enzyme activity values were quite similar to controls.     keene GSN corners and GSereruted enzyme actrees mgermrets BSO- of BSO+AD! reste meee Miter Alen S582" AGivt Pa edaemnna cerenes Giet ST dimming ie oe  Conclusion ee  tairain wane Oe  - ADT exerts an antagonistic effect on the BSO-induced y-glutamyicysteine synthetase inhibition. This effect was noticeable with ADT dosage as low as 10 mg/kg in mice given BSOatavery high dosage (0.5 mM/kg). Moreover, ADT alone was able to increase, in BSO-untreated mice, the liver cytosol reduced glutathione content. It can be concluded that ADT exerts a stimulating activity on the GSH synthesis, probably via the +  glulamylcysteine synthetase enzyme activity. The preventive effect of ADT on AAP-induced kthality and hepatotoxicity in mice (1) couldbe explained at least partly by this mechanism.  2501387695  D.

FASEB Feature Service July 1979 Page 12  CiGaReTTE SMOKE INHIBITS PROTEIN SYNTHESIS  The body's ability to manufacture proteins; a function which is absolutely essential to many life processes, appears to be affected by cigarette smoke, according to research published in the May, 1979 issue of The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.  University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy researchers Ruby J.B. Garrett, PhD,  and M.A. Jackson have found that cigarette smoke inhibits protein synthesis in  ’ the livers of experimental rats. Carbon moncxide, the investigators speculated,  may be the smoke component responsible for this inhibition, altering protein synthesis by directly interfering with the protein synthesizing machinery or by reducing oxygen levels in the cell to such an extent that the energy molecules needed to drive protein synthesis camot be produced. .  Dr. Garrett is a member of The American Physiological Society, part of the Federation of Anerican Societies for Experimental Biology.  A number of recent studies have shown that smokers and nonsmokers react differently to many drugs. One reason may be increased drug metabolism in cigarette smokers caused by the induction of special drug-metabolizing enzymes after chronic exposure to cigarette smoke.  Some investigators have shown that enzyme induction is related to protein synthesis. With this in mind, the Kentucky researchers set out to deternine the inmediate effect of acute smoke exposure on protein synthesis.  The experiments were carried out on laboratory rats exposed to either 15 or 60 puffs of cigarette smoke at a rate of one puff per minute. A “single-port  reverse smoking machine"' was used to generate puffs similar to those normally  (more)  Qin 12215 __label__Report
Research Department  MEMORANDUM September 2, 1971  NEW_IMPACT STANDARDS /715 MEV LoD  A new series of impact standards has been developed and recently reported by R&DE, Southampton(!), Although the Southampton approach was expected to be an improvemant over the chemical standards, we felt that BéW's needs would still not be met by these new standards. Consequently, we have been pursuing the development of our own series. Preliminary results are quite encouraging.  This memo covers my comments on the Southampton Report and the status of our developmental work.     O6-R     Ad Comments on R&DE Report Ri  Jeremy Wood's report contains several points of immediate importance in view of on-going WOODROSE activities and current R&D projects.  1. The new series of nine impact standards are designed to give more precise determinations than the previous standards, covering the same impact sensation range (0 to 4 is now 1 to 9).  2. The filter cigarettes are available from R&DE and Wood makes the recommendation that the new standards be used by all panels using WOODROSE .  3. Very casually in passing, Wood makes the comment that impact "should be based on the whole cigarette and not merely on the first few puffs." This is news to me.     The new series is based on the relationship between extractable nicotine delivery and impact. The desired levels of impact sensation are produced by blends of two flue-cured tobaccos, widely differing in nicotine concent, in proportions to yield theoretical nicotine deliveries, which give just noticeable differences (j.n.d.) in impact. Calculations for the tobacco blend formulations are based on the theory that the difference between two stimuli is what is important in determining j.n.d. and net absolute values,  The impact standards, identified as IMP/1, IMP/2...IMP/9, were evaluated by “blind” panel testing. Ten members scored, by the old scale, adjacent pairs from memory, i.e., no standards were used. The panel average re- sults ranged from 0.56 for IMP/1 to 3.50 for IMP/9 with all samples falling in the "carrect" sequence. However, for three of the adjacent pairs,     Diooe, D.

ARK  SWEDISH MATCH  . . May 28, 1997  LE 4  The Honorable Arne H. Carlson Governor's Office  130 State Capitol  St. Paul, MN 55155  Dear Governor Carlson:  Tam wriling to you on behalf of Swedish Match North America Inc. (“SMNA") to express my company’s Concer about particular aspects of HF. No. 117. By way of background, SMNA has recently bogun to import cigars into tho United States. Our product line ic comprised of cigars in all price segments (from low priced to premium) and it is our intention to introduce over 30 varieties of cigats into the United States’ market, Accordingly, SMINA's entry imo the United States (and Minnesota) cigar market will foster greater competition and offer adult consumers of cigars additional products from which to choose.  Section 5 of HLF. No, 117, however, represents 4 substantial bartier to SMNA's entry of the Minnesota cigar market. This section would require companies that sc cigars in Minucsota to submit annual reports which idenrify, by brand, whether detectable levels of ammonia o1 any compound of ammonia, arsenic, cadmium, formaidehyde or lead are present in thelr prochuct in its burned or unburned state.  SMNA does not currently have in place any testing procedures to determine the presence of these substances, J hag never had a need to develop sch jnocedures, because no other country or state requires collection of this information. Moreover, the development of such testing procedures would take significant time. SMNA would nut be able to develop such procedures prior to August 1, 1997 -- the date by which sellers of cigars in Minnesota must begin to collect data regarding and disclose the presence of the HF. No. 117 enumerated substances. ' Finally, even if a testing procedure could be developed in a timely mannor, the cost of testing over 30 varieties of cigars both in a burned and unburned state would be substantial.  Faced with these problems, SMNA simply could not sell its cigars in the state of Minnesota. Besed upon SMNA's knowledge of the United States cigar industry, SMNA anticipates that other relatively omell cigar manufketurers and importers would he forced to make the same choice because ILF, No. 17's requirements would be too burdensuime. Moreover, even larger cigar manufacturers and importers would be faced with wils choice, In stus, the impact of  Swedish Match Chewing ‘lobacce Division  ane I a RI                 Adsrest” rene tax ONE OE ET AMARONE  6800 wos: Bond firon (G04) 287-8200 04} 267-2208 Post ice Box 14688 Rohmoral, Vegisa 29290-1668  T11121-1794 __label__Letter

Philip Morris USA CONFIDENTIAL  PHILIP MORRIS U.S. A. INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: Distribution Date: August 2, 1993  From: _ T. Holland 49h ww . Subject: Cast Leaf - Monthly Development Summary - July 1993  NBL Product Development  Marlboro configuration cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 15 parts ammonia) produced during the April trial at the current BL Plant line speed (350 fpm) and at increased line speed  (390 fpm) were evaluated by the Flavor Technology panel and found to have subjective parity with the Marlboro control. When submitted to the Richmond panel, differences were detected, however, the opinion of the panelists were that NBL is close subjectively and could achieve  parity with fine tune adjustments to the dryer profile.  A BL plant factory trial was conducted in May to produce NBL at 390 fpm with a reduced ammonia formulation from 15 parts to 10 parts. Air sampling was conducted on Line 1 to confirm the reduction of ammonia in the dryer emissions. Preliminary results indicated a 40% reduction in ammonia emissions (normalized to production throughput) was achieved which is in line with expected reductions based upon theoretical calculations.  Cigarettes incorporating NBL (with 10 parts ammonia) produced in the May trial have been produced and are scheduled for evaluation by the Flavor Technology panel the week of  August 2, 1993. NBL Commercialization  A cost estimate to retrofit the BL Plant with the minimum essential equipment to produce NBL at an increase line rate of 390 fpm has been prepared. The estimated cost is $3.2 million  total capital and expense which would generate a 42.0 % ROI based upon reduced overtime at the BL Plant to produce forecasted production of 47 million pounds. An implementation schedule will be established after review with Environmental Engineering to assess the implications of implementing NBL with regards to timing and environmental control requirements for the environmental permit at the BL plant site.  With conversion of the BL Plant to NBL, the facility would have the capability to produce Cast Leaf with the addition of a guar gum feeder.  GG6E6S60506 __label__Memo

INTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE  Richmond, Virginia  To: -Colon Rowe Date: July 31, 1989 From: -Dick Howe  Subject: .Nicotine Overspray  Enclosed please find a draft cf the Job Safe Procedure for the over- spray of nicotine on cut filler or like material. In accordance with our previous discussions and with your approval, we developed this procedure for your explosion-proof room in Semiworks. We feel this offers several advantages to the small scale room previously considered. One is the obvious increase in safety from fire or explosion. In addition, it is more isolated from other work and we feel the drying can be done in the same room to avoid transporting the tobacco cutside.  The installation of the spray cylinder and valving/reservoir unit in the explosion proof room is underway. A hole will need to be drilled through to the adjacent room (primary) to install the spray unit control system which is not spark-proof. A window is to be added to the door of the explosion- proof room (not to exceed 100 sq.in.) to allow visual contact with the inside worker and the spray cylinder operation. This will allow the backup team to be in standby mode (not “on air").  Johnny Jones and Linda Guinn of EEP have assured me that the window in the door and the hole drilled through the wall can be properly sealed to maintain the explosion proof integrity of the room. K.H. Cho and Mike Penn are arranging to install a Class A, Division I (spark-proof) cylinder rotating motor with belt drive instead of chain drive and an airline lockout system for added safety. We simply need to ensure that the electrical conduit used for installation meets the same criteria.  This procedure is now scheduled to use nicotine free. base dissolved in ethanol instead of nicotine citrate. Our procedure was written to cover both contingencies.  To the best of my knowledge this experiment is planned for August 7, 1989. We plan to spray filler with alcohol first - as a “dry run” for our procedure and for use as a control sample for the research. Then we intend to spray one batch of filler with nicotine at the 2.15% loading level (filler analysis) which is designed to deliver the" middle” level in smoke required for the research. This experiment will be conducted very slowly with many samples taken to help define the hazards and safety precautions necessary. Extra safety precautions will be taken during this first run which may be deemed unneccessary upon review of the procedure and in light of the analysis data and the experience of handling the tobacco produced. The room may be needed all week.  The remaining three sprayings scheduled are to be done August 14, 1989 and August 15, 1989 if needed.

The Hispanic market in Pheenix is clearly a full-taste non-menthel murket. Marlboro an¢ Winston are far and away the leading brands. At best, menthol usage among Hispanic smokers is about equal to the E al average (30%), In ne way does menthol usage in the Hispanic community resemble that of the Black community. There does not appear to be any stigma asgociated with menthol cigarcttcs however,            KOOL and Salem full-taste styles are neck and neck in the Phoenix Hispanic market but neither is considered by siore managers to be a fast mover in compazisen to Marlboro and Winston,  Low 'tar' brands, menthol and non-menthol, nave exhibited only marginal growth among Hispanics according to the trade. Roughly 10-20% of brands stocked in stores in the heart of the Hispanic com- munity were hi-fi's.

Receptor-Specific Induction of Individual AP-1 Components in B Lymphocytes’  Li Huo* and Thomas L. Rothstein?**  Departments of *Medicine and ‘Microbiology and the *Evans Memorial Department of Clinical Research, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118  The inducible nuclear transcription factor complex, AP-1, typically consists of heterodimers between Jun and Fos proteins. Although components are drawn from families of related molecules, little is known about the physiologic regulation of jun- and fos-related gene products. In particular, it is not known whether expression of individual family members is stimulus-specific or whether the same signaling pathways are responsible for induction of all subunits. To clarify these issues, AP-1 components were examined following activation of primary 8 lymphocytes through two separate receptors, the surface Ig Ag receptor, and the CD40 receptor for T cell influences. Both forms of stimulation led to expression of JunB and JunD mRNA and protein; however, induction of JunB mediated by anti-lg Ab was protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent, whereas induction mediated by CD40 ligand was resistant to PKC depletion. The two forms of stimulation diverged even further with respect to Fos expression. Although both stimuli induced c-Fos, expression of FosB was stimulus specific at both the mRNA and protein levels, in that this component was induced by anti-Ig but not by CD40 ligand. Stimulated expression ‘of c-Fos and FosB was in all cases PKC-independent. These results provide evidence for receptor-specific differences in the expression of AP-1 components, primarily with respect to FosB. They also indicate that separate intracellular pathways may be used for induction of jun and fos gene products and that the same transcription factor (junB) may be triggered by two surface receptors through separate pathways that differ in PKC dependence. The Journal of Immunology, 1995, 154: 3300-3309.  eceptor interactions at the B cell surface leading R to proliferative responses initiate a series of in-  tracellular biochemical events that eventuate in alteration of the resting program of gene expression as a result of nuclear changes that regulate transcriptional ac- tivation. The likely mediators coupling cytosolic signaling to transcriptional activation are sequence-specific DNA binding proteins or transcription factors that express trans- activating activity. In recent work we and others have demonstrated that B cell stimulation is associated with in- ducible nuclear expression or modification of several tran- scription factor complexes, including NF-«B, NF-AT,  CREB, and AP-1° (1-6, 6a, 6b). The AP-1 complex con- sists of two proteins that may be represented as homo- or heterodimers and that bind the consensus sequence TGACTCA (7). Constituent proteins are characterized by the presence of a leucine zipper that is involved in dimer formation and are drawn from two gene families, jun and fos. Jun proteins may homodimerize or heterodimerize with Fos protein to form DNA-binding AP-1; Fos is inca- pable of homodimerizing or binding DNA alone. Well de- scribed family members include c-jun (8, 9), junB (10), JunD (11, 12), c-fos (13, 14), and fosB (15-18), which may be expressed in two forms as a result of alternative splic- ing, a full length version and a short form (16-18). In addition, two Fos-related Ags, Fra-1 and Fra-2, have been described (19-21) although sequences for the murine sys- tem have not been reported. Clearly, the Jun and Fos fam- ilies represent an extensive grouping that is of special in- terest because of the large number of proteins from which inducible AP-1 may be drawn and hence the extensive     Received for publication September 16, 1994.

Aller ( Subject: + Suggested Remarks Following Surgeon General's Report     Philip Morris Incorporated is a strong advocate of public ° debate. It is through such discussion and analysis of the issues that our citizens are able to reach their own personal decisions. When, however, a federal government department takes it upon itself to prohibit the making of that free choice,  x  we have moved out of the realm of public discussion and into that of coercion. This is where Mr. Califano, in his misguided zealousness, has taken us. Rather than devoting his time and money to in- - creased tobacco and health research, he has chosen to expend them on a public relations campaign aimed at making smokers appear as second class citizens whose rights are not worth protecting. Such demagoguery serves only to cloud the issue, _and is of no value in finding answers to public questions. In the last twenty years Philip Morris, along with other members of the tobacco industry, has provided more than $70 million for independent research on smoking and health questions. In many of these years this commitment has exceeded that of any government department, andi has been substantially  more than the research expenditure reported by all the voluntary  health associations combined. 4003040251     1 excerpted from "Facts About The Smoking Controversy" __label__Memo

Dilibertot, Gerry Gordon, and Brian Hermani§1  From the tLaboratories for Cell RBiciogy, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy and the §Cancer Cell Biology Program, Lineberger Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27399  Three specific platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms are thought to bind with differing affinities to two distinct PDGF receptors which undergo activation following dimerization. Recent evi- dence has been presented that marked differences exist between the ability of PDGF-AA versus PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB to stimulate alterations in second messen- gers in cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), a result which was thought to be due to low numbers of the A-type receptor in this cell type (Sach- inidis, A., Locker, R., Vetter, W., Tatje, D., and Hoppe, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10238-10243, 1990), In particular, PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB but not PDGF- AA could elicit alterations in cytosolic free calcium (Ca**,). However, because these studies were per- formed on large cell populations using biochemical as- says of PDGF activity, a minor PDGF-AA-Ca?'-re- sponsive population of cells might go undetected. To test this possibility, VSMC were isolated from either thoracic or abdominal pig aorta, and alterations in Ca**; were monitored using Multiparameter Digitized Video Microscopy following stimulation with PDGF isoforms alone, or either before or after exposure of VSMC to 5 mm EGTA. PDGF-AA-responsive cells were found to exist only in cultures of thoracic VSMC, caused oscillations in Ca”*;, represented 20% of the PDGF-BB-responsive cells, and were subsequently re- sponsive to PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB elicited monophasic alterations in Ca?*; in both thoracic and abdominal VSMC. Prior addition of EGTA inhibited PDGF-AA but not PDGF-BB-induced alterations in Ca?*;, Addi- tion of EGTA during PDGF-AA-induced Ca**; oscilla- tions inhibited subsequent oscillations in Ca”*;, while addition of EGTA at the peak of the PDGF-BB Ca** response resulted in a more rapid return of Ca**; to prestimulation levels. These data suggest that regional differences in the distribution of PDGF-A- and B-type receptor exists in viva, and that activation of the A- and B-type PDGF receptors results in distinct altera- tions in Ca’*;,  * This work was supported by Grants AG07218, AG10104, 2-PO1- CA29589, and 2-P30-C.A16086 from the National Institutes of Health. the Gustavus and Louise Pfeiffer Research Foundation, and Grant FRA-383 from the American Cancer Society.

PDGF" elicits a variety of biological activities in VSMC (mitogenesis, chemotaxis, and vasoconstriction) through the existence of distinct PDGF isoforms and receptors (1-4). Human PDGF consists of two disulfide-bonded homologous peptide chains, A and B (PDGF-AB). Each chain is the product of a distinct cellular gene, their expression being independently regulated and the two chains sharing approxi- mately 50% homology (5-7). Porcine PDGF appears to be a BB homodimer as is PDGF isolated from most animal species (except human} (8). Skeletal and smooth muscle, growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts and a number of tumor cell lines produce exclusively PDGF-AA (9-11).  These different types of PDGF molecules are thought to bind to at least two distinct types of PDGF receptors. The originally described receptor (B-type, 180 kDa, similar to the CSF-1 receptor) was found to bind the B chain of PDGF, is located on chromosome 4 and possesses tyrosine kinase activ- ity (12). A second type of PDGF receptor (A-type, 170 kDa, similar to the c-kit gene product) is thought to bind both PDGF A and B chains, is located on chromosome 4, and also contains tyrosine kinase activity (13). Since the receptors display some selectivity in terms of which PDGF chains they can bind, and because active PDGF molecules are thought to exist as dimers, a number of models have recently been proposed where PDGF binding to its receptors requires di- merization of the A- and B-type receptor subunits to elicit functional activity (14-16). These models predict that dimer- ization of two A-type receptors could lead to binding of all three types of PDGF isoforms (AA, BB, AB), while dimeri- zation of two B-type receptors could only lead to binding of PDGF-BB (although some data suggests that PDGF-AB can bind to cells containing only the B-type receptor albeit at 10- fold lower affinity than PDGF-BB). A key aspect of these models is that in cells lacking the A-type PDGF receptor, there should be no response to either PDGF-AA or PDGF- AB.  The mechanisms by which PDGF binding to its receptor is transduced into biological activity are still unclear. Our lab- oratory has been studying the role of POGF-induced altera- tion in Ca**; in PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis (17-21). PDGF addition to a variety of cells causes a rapid transient increase in Ca’*,; within seconds of addition (22), and results from our laboratory as well as others (17-21, 23-31) demonstrate that inhibition of POGF-stimulated increases in Ca**; also inhibit  ?

oa)  Souilbeengl, TOBACCO COMPANY:  MEMORANDUM January 2, 1991  TO:: FF. J. Schultz FROM: S. 8S. Miller  SUBJECT: Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes  Direction was given to develop a modified Newport cigarette with "low ignition propensity" properties that smoked equal to the control. Prior work by A. M. Ihrig) and C. I. Lewis showed that a blend containing between 30% and 50% expanded tobacco and a cigarette paper having a Coresta value between 9 and 11 would result in a cigarette having the: desirable “low ignition" properties. Although these modifications. gave the desired “low ignition" properties the cigarettes smoked very bland and were undesirable when compared to a control Newport..  A blend containing 30% Burley/Flue: cured P.T. with increased casing and. recasiing was developed to make the modified cigarette smoke comparable to a control Newport. This combination in addition to the low Coresta. cigarette paper yielded approximately a 35-40% increase in CPM. Higher filtration and air dilution was incorporated to reduce the CPM to the control. level.  Old Gold. and Golden Light "low ignition propensity" cigarettes were also developed using the same: blend, casing and recasing modifications.  Based on the Product Development. panel tests the test. samples were found comparable tio the controls.  When this project was started it was. referred to as. “Self Extinguishing Cigarettes" Project B-337. As of December, 1990 this project will be referred to as “Low Ignition Propensity Cigarettes," Project B-337.  Fabric ignition testing was done to determine if the test cigarettes after all combined modifications were made, still exibited low ignition properties. Also a series of analytical tests were run. to determine if the smoke: chemistry had. changed.  SULST6ELS __label__Memo

INTER-OFFICE MEMORANDUM March 7, 1986 TO: Der R. Pugh FROM: C. D. Mays, 8. F. Niven  SUBJECT: R.A.N. Project Extraction Programs  Dr. W. Y. Rice and A. J. Sensabaugh have recently conducted a series of experiments which resulted in cigarette smoke condensate displaying markedly reduced biological activity. These experiments involved the application of aqueous burley extract to flue-cured tobacco and preparation of cigarettes from the resultant treated flue-cured tobacco. Biological activity -was determined through use of Ames tests.  Investigation and developm t of this concept and a likely process for making ‘ees biologically active yet flavorful smoking products will include accitional experiments tsiaqg various solvents and extraction practices. ~ ent meetings with Gr. Rice cleared the way for us to begin extraction . .sies of sizable semples. We are to extract, or to have extracted by contracted means, at least three grades of burley tobaccos (must include KJOX) and use the extract to enhance three grades cf flue-cured tobaccos. Smoke condensate from resulting test cigarettes (burley extract enhanced flue-cured) will be given to Dr. Rice for biological assay.  we also understand that perhaps some or all the test Cigarettes should use expanded tobacco. We have just written a preliminary disclosure of a process invention covering the means for extract enhancement and friling value increase of tobacco/tobacco flavored material. In all iikelinocd, development anc commercialization of this new process will require and Justify design and construction of a bench scale pilot plant to be located either here or at Avoca,  We expect to begin extracting samples using conventional practices here this month and we are hopeful that the patent disclosure memorandum wil] clear the way for us to engage Muller Extract Company, GMBH for supercritical extraction/expansion studies.

KKEOO THER  | ANALYSIS OF THE GASEOUS PHASE OF CIGARETTE SMOKE  A number of anslyses were performed on the gaseous components of tobacco smoke during the first helf “of the twentieth century, but it was not until the 1950’s, when the availability and wide- spread use of more sophisticated quantitative instrumentation made it possible to determine very minute concentrations, that the major eontribution concerning the vapor phase composition appeared in  print. Until this time, the emphasis had been placed on the  particulate metter of cigarette smoke, which comprises little more  than one-twentieth of the whole smoke.  fhe analysis of cigarette smoke, composed of atmospheric  gases and a cemplex mixture of substances derived fron the ccmbus- tion end pyrolysis of tobacco, peses a difficult problen, For purposes of analysis, 1t is convenient to separate these substances into a particulate phase and a gaseous phase.

I am concerned about priorities too, so important areas aren’t neglected or that effort isn’t squandered on back-burner activities.  Summary of Activities  SUBSTRATE PROCESSING IMPROVEMENTS -- Priority #1  Improvements are sought in the present substrate process of loading -14 + 20 mesh alumina spheres into the aluminum capsule. Bead strength and attrition resistance should be improved and the flow of the beads into the capsules could be improved. Current efforts with Dick Haberkern and John Stewart are focused on increasing the strength of the substrate by doping the alumina prior to sintering. Oxide additives such as Na» and MgO alter the pore structure during the sintering process. The present concept is to maintain pore size at a minimum acceptable with concomitant development of maximum pore volume. Since pores are stress concentrators, large pores usually result in low strength. Some preliminary data look promising in this respect, but continuing effort is required. Inorganic powdered flow promoters, such as the tricalcium phosphate commonly used in pharmaceutical products, are being screened to determine effectiveness.

Gardner, Ph.D. Seientifie Director  The Council for Tobacco Research-U.S.A., Inc. 110 East 59th Street New York, New York 10022  Dear Dr. Gardner:  Following our discussion in New Haven, I reviewed my twin populations born between 1897 and 1952. Our records show that there were 7,859 pairs of like-sexed twins born in this period who sur- vived to one year of age. Studies we have conducted in the past would lead me to say that we should be able to locate approximately 60% or better of this population with both members alive and living  in Connecticut. This certainly is more than the minimum number of pairs we discussed.  I have requested permission to attend the meeting in Miami Beach the week of December 10 and have made reservations for arriv- ing on the 9th. I hope you will make reservations for me. I anti- cipate approval of my request and hope to see you shortly.  Sincerely yours,  WMA  Merton S.

October 19, 1994 MEMO  TO: J. D. Heck and C. L. Gaworski FROM: M. M. Dozier  SUBJECT:: Progress! Report for September 1994 ACUTE TOXICITY/IMMUNOMODULATORY TESTING  R. House at IITRI finished alll scheduled follow-up immune function studies for B100. While there was: some question. as to the suitability of some: of the posiitive assay controls. used, results suggest. no effect of B100 on natural killer cell activity or T-cell blastogenesis. (with anti-CD3). The extended dose Listeria host resistance assay (usiing B6C3F1 mice instead of CD1). was not valid due to a lack of the required 5-35¥ mortality in the control group. It is undecided! at. this: time whether to repeat this assay using Listeria or use another bacterial host resistance model. However, T-cell function as assessed by induction of delayed type hypersensitivity was affected by dosing with B100.. This may indicate that in vivo testing during the dosing period or in vitro methods using tissue harvested during the dosing period or shortly thereafter (before extensive celi replication) may better reveal immunomodulatory effects. It may also be interesting to look at stress-related endpoints (ACTH, glucecorticoids, etc).  Immunomodulatory testing of B35 was initiated, as well as range finder testing for B240 and B249.  Prices were received for both acute: toxicity and! immunomodulatory testing of compounds in. 1995,  CELLULOSE ACETATE {CA) FIBER. PROJECT  Due to the intense efffort required of the local arrangements committee for the upcoming TCRC, no work was done on this project this: month. Results on chemical analyses are still pending from F. Perini, who was also busy preparing a TCRC presentation.  TCRC.

Henry Paulus, Ph.D. Boston Biomedical Research Institute Dept. of Metabolic Regulation 20 Staniford St. Boston, MA 02114 Re: Grant No, 2723R1  Dear Dr. Paulus:  The Council for Tobacco Research, USA, Inc. is pleased to award you a renewal grant in the amount of $68,138.00 for the period from July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992 for the study proposed in your application “Adaptation of Yeast to Osmotic Stress.” It is understood that this grant is made subject to acceptance by institutional authorities. Also, many applications to CTR indicate partial or complete overlap with applications to other agencies. If the latter result in awards, we should be promptly notified so that we can negotiate an appropriate adjustment of our award.  The award is made without guarantee of support beyond June 30, 1992, even though we recognize that your original application proposed a study extending one year beyond that date. Therefore, if by November 30, 199! you submit to us a formal renewal application, including a report of your progress to date, your request will receive consideration.  Your attention is called to the enclosed “Important Procedural Information for Grantees", Please fill in the attached “Notice of Research Project” and return it to me. Drs. Donald Ford, Associate Research Director, and Harmon McAllister, Scientific Director, will serve as your primary contact with our scientific staff on matters concerning your grant. Please consult the staff as questions or problems arise, and keep us informed about the progress of your study.  As Principal Investigator, you should know that CTR recovers unexpended balances at the end of each grant year. We suggest that you personally keep an accurate record of expenditures and commitments to assure that you agree with your institution's official financial statement at the end of the grant year. Please note that year-end deficits cannot be recovered from CTR, even from funds awarded in a subsequent year. Finally, please be aware that our failure to receive timely annual financial statements from your grants office will stop further grant payments. Appropriate forms will be sent to your financial officer at the end of the grant year. Administrative problems are relatively rare and we hope that this statement of our fiscal policies will obviate any possible misunderstandings.

Hearing on General Services Administration Policy on Smoking’ in Federal Buildings  Per your request, I have. become involved in preparations for next Tuesday’s oversight hearing before the Public Buildings.and Grounds Subcommittee (Public Works Full Committee), chaired by Rep. Jim Traficant (D-OH). After learning of the hearing late yesterday afternoon, I have canvassed the “friendly” Member staffs of the Subcommittee and the Tobacco Institute. as. to: the current situation. My findings, initial actions, and' future considerations  are set forth below.  Background  Apparently, Chairman Traficant indicated his intention to conduct a hearing on the GSA’s regulations regarding smoking in federal buildings. at an organizational meeting of the Subcommittee several weeks ago. This item was one of fifteen items discussed and no particular emphasis or priority was given to the tobacco issue at that time.  Republican sources believe that Traficant has chosen to hold this hearing now because the federal building smoking policy has become a “high profile” issue due to: the actions of Rep. Durbin (D-IL). Holding the hearing now would also be in accord with the House Democratic leadership request that House Committee and Subcommittee Chairmen “get busy” to show action. Moreover, these sources see some reason to believe that there may be a Traficant/Durbin “conspiracy” at. work. Apparently, Traficant.has been “spending a lot of time” in the Appropriations Committee on specific District projects; which could indicate some type of a trade off between Traficant and Durbin (who chairs the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee).  The Hearing a ° The plans are for Tuesday to be an Oversight hearing on the GSA. There ar@y three items slated to be addressed: & ¢ The GSA smoking policy in federal buildings. & * The GSA plans for child care facilities: in all federal buildings. oO ¢ The GSA use of alternative fuels in all federally leased or owned La} automobiles. «J __label__Memo

FASEB Summer Research:Conference.on the “Physiology and Pathophysiology of the Splanchnic Circulation", which will be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado on July 26-31, 1992. This conference will tentatively have sessions on the following topics: _ 0  Session I Chemical Modulators of Gastrointestinal Blood Flow  Session II Interactions Between Neural . and Local Mechanisms of:  . Vasoregulation - Session III Molecular and Cellular Basis of Microvascular Functions. Session IV The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury:  “Role of Blood Flow and Vascular Permeability - Session V . The Microvasculature and Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury: Role of Angiogenesis Session VI . Role of the Circulation in Inflammatory Bowel. Disease (IBD) Session VII Hepatic Circulation and Metabolism Session VIII Alcohol Effects on the Liver and G.I. Tract. Session IX Portal Hypertension.  The philosophy and goals of the meeting are unique. “In addition to bringing | together clinicians. and. basic scientists with interests. in disorders of the  _ Splanchnic organs, the meeting will bring traditional investigators of the  splanchnic circulation together with investigators using more cellular or molecular techniques. Thus, we hope to identify potential new research areas and to stimulate interdisciplinary research efforts. As the Conference  Chairman, I would like to invite approximately 50 eminent investigators to speak at the meeting, and I want to encourage a number of promising young investigators to attend, by. paying their expenses. Although both the American Gastroenterological Society and FASEB have endorsed the conference. and have provided generous financial support, I still need about $15,000 to ensure that the meeting is a scientific success. The funds will be used exclusively for support of eminent clinical and basic science investigators’ meeting costs.  ($400) and travel expenses (between $400 and-$1000 for ‘domestic and foreign participants).  Any amount of funding your. organization can contribute will be a great help. In addition, if any of the members of your organization would benefit from | attending the conference, Please bring the opportunity. to their attention.

Boutwell, M.D. 2935 Harvard Drive Madison, WI 53705  Dear Roz:  First of all, we miss you. The SAB continues to roll along, but your wisdom and humor were always admired. Now, I need the wisdom especially.  It is possible that at some time in the future there may be some legal action which would touch CTR. We need someone of stature who would be willing to plainly state the facts, i.e., that the research supported by CTR over the years was never influenced by our sponsors and that the award of funds for biomedical research were made with total objectivity  by the SAB. No one is better qualified to do this than you are,  Frankly, this matter may never come up. The first anticipated possibility of needing such testimony is some two or three years in the future. However, our lawyers do want to know whom they might call upon, and I hope you will agree to do this.  Needless to say, you would be reimbursed for your time and expenses in connection with anything of this sort.  If you feel that you would be able to help me; I would appreciate it if you would send along a copy of your current curriculum vitae and bibliography. I will in turn pass them along to our attorneys.  I hope that you and Lou are doing well and I send my warmest personal regards always. Thanks and all best wishes.  Sincerely, Ly  mes F.

I AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL because I myself was a smoker for about 4.0 years. Now, here I sit with an . oxygen tank in my hands trying to get enough air to survive.  I applaud every young man and every young woman who chooses not to smoke. They show respect for the rights of others by first demonstrating respect for their own bodies. What a thoughtful example they are to all people (everyone from the ‘youngest infant to the oldest great grandparent) when they — refuse to follow the example of their smoking elders. It is adults who smoke who should be shamed by them. How asinine  of those adults who smoke to ask that they be allowed ta continue that travesty! Ce,  I am glad you indicated that your firm is Legislative Counsel for the Tobacco Institute. Now, please show self-respect and respect for the rights of ALL people who breathe air, by in- ~ sisting that tobacco find other legitimate uses--uses which do. not infringe on the rights of all human beings who have a right. ._ to breathe unpolluted air. et  I know I can't defeat you lawyers but I can keep "pecking away™ and maybe, some day, I can sit down in a public place to eat without having smoke blown into my face; maybe I can listen to a soeech or hear some music in a public place without enduring cigerette smoke and maybe I can consult a doctor without being asphyxiated by cigarette smoke in the waiting room before L get to see him. , me .  “esepesoso ©  Just last night I consulted my doctor because I was choking.

ea Oe vem oF  cigarettes, they often change their smoking patterns. “It” ---->  has been alleged that this is owing to "compensation" to --~  metre rte Hn     allow for differing nicotine contents of the cigarettes. “We found that the amounts of nicotine produced from the NC and the RC under human smoking conditions, however, were roughly proportional to the amounts produced under "standard" conditions. Our studies show that smokers smoke the NC differently than the RC, since they take more puffs closer together in time. The cigarettes are different from one another in many respects, however, other than nicotine yields. There is no evidence for compensation, as judged by  the amount of nicotine absorbed relative to the yield of  nicotine.  yeu 22. Did you at any time notice smokers compensating their smoking patterns when smoking the NC?  How one responds to a question on compensation depends on its definition. If one defines "compensation" as the smokers attempt to achieve a particular plasma nicotine level concordant with his/her accustomed plasma nicotine level when smoking his/her regular brand, when compared to PREMIER, then we can say there is no compensation. The smoker’s level of plasma nicotine level when smoking PREMIER  never approaches those plasma nicotine levels observed when  smoking the reference cigarettes.

PHILIP MORRIS USAC INTER-OF FICE CORRESPONDENCE  TO: FROM:  SUBJECT:  120 PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017-5592  Steve Piskor DATE: September 21, 1992  Karen Eisen, Natalfe Ellis  Marlboro Promotion Programs Qualitative Report  Attached Is the moderator's report on the recently conducted series of focus groups on Marlboro promotion ideas developed by Young & Rubicam. Key findings include:  » "Marlboro Country" offers opportunities to broaden and contemporize ihe brand's image through connections to both environmentalism and adventure.  * The concept of “The Mariboro Foundation" which would purchase open jand for  preservation offered particularly strong imagery and made consumers feel good about choosing Marlboro. However, there was also considerable cynicism as to the company's motives which made any retail tie-in suspect.  * The "Marlboro Adventure Team" concept (as executed by Y&R) offered greater potential for promotional programs but was more limited in its imagery. While some men relished the idea of an all out adventure in Marlboro Country, most were somewhat  intimidated. They would prefer weekend hiking or fishing trips rather than more strenuous “Adventures.”  « Some of the later groups combined the ideas and were excited by the concept of a Marlboro Environmental SWAT Team that would perform "heroic" clean-ups and  respond to natural disasters such as Hurricane Andrew. There appeared to be strong  appeal to the idea of modern-day Marlboro Men publicly performing strenuous “good deeds."  ec: D. Beran A. Burke E. Gee N. Lund A. Macrae J. Mullen-Sampson S. Piskor M.

Now the tobacco industry's offering a new set of ads to television stations urging children not to smoke. The Tobacco Institute's spots calls for kids to talk to their parents before lighting up. There's also an 800 number you can call to get a free booklet on how to help your youngsters avoid the habit.  (Graphic: Free Stop Smoking Booklet 1-800-342-9099 From The US Tobacco Institute)  However, the American Lung Association isn't impressed by the  campaign. A spokesman called it a calculated campaign that makes smoking appear to be an adult habit.  Jane Rinka, co-anchor:  Which we know it’s not. Smoking is unfortunately one of the  causes of health problems which keep the demand for medical professionals high.  # # #  TIMN 409443  Material supplied by VMS may onty be used for internal review, analysis or research.

PROJECT SUMMARY: -  Be brief-200 word maximum: (Include Objective, Approach, / . ~ Current Plans and/or . Progress) Analytical methods will be developed to separate the naturally occur- i ring stereoisomer 1-nicotine from d-nicotine. Attempts to. accomplish this { will involve the use of high performance liquid and capillary gas chromato— i . eraphic columns with stationary phases containing optically pure chiral i @ groups. Another approach to be investigated involves the interactions of t nicotine with various optically. pure chiral acids and separations of the re- . sulting diastereomeric ion pairs by liquid chromatography. A less attrac } tive possibility involves chemical modification of nicotine by an efficient | nonstereoselective process to a species which can besconverted to diastereo~ { meric derivatives. The resulting derivatives might be separable by liquid | or gas chromatographic techniques. Once suitable chromatographic methods ! ‘have been developed for the ‘micro-scale analyses of d- and i-nicotine, ‘studies will be initiated to accurately determine the degree of conversion of the natural l-isomer to its enantiomer during the burning of tobacco.  The comparative metabolism of d- and 1-nicotine will also be investigated in rats and mice following administration of the racemic compound. In addi~ tion, methods will ‘be’ developed for preparative-scale chromatographic separ~ ations of the enantiomers of nicotine and nornicotine. :     50168370 __label__Report

Although neither sample was rated quite equivalent to the current. production Brazilian in taste charac- teristics, they are both probably within the range of acceptability. The UHE Brazilian was preferred over the Manheimer Penguin Brand. The latter sample was designated as being Formosan but the ratio of neo- menthol to neoisomenthol indicates that the menthol is from plants grown in Brazil.  . » Tucker  CLT':.gm  Xe. Mr. C. E.

PROJECT TITLE : ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATIONS  PERIOD COVERED FEBRUARY 1981  WRITTEN BY : E. LECOULTRE, M. MURRAY AND: J.PIADE     SACCHARIN  Several tipping papers and one reference tipping paper sample were analyzed for saccharin. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed by HPLC. The method involved acid (0.05N H,S0,) and diethyl ether extraction and determination on a’ C8 column (15 cm) with water, acetic  acid, methanol (59/1/40) eluent.  All results were confirmed by Gc*/MS after gerivatization of saccharin to N-methyl saccharin (2) by M (197) and fragmentation. Results have been submitted to OC PME  (3) (4).  At the request of QC PME. a rather simple spot test for the presence of sodium saccharin on TP is being sought. The  precipitation reaction between a dilute acidic silver nitrate  solution and sodium saccharin seems promising. Work is continuing concerning the sensitivity and the selectivity  of the method.

Crttbivul  TOBACCO COMPANY  January 7, 1999  TO: Mr. 8, L. Enloe  FROM: Bob Klein  SUBJECT: CONDITION LETTER - Fourth Quarter 1998  LORILLARD SALES TRENDS  Maverick Specials -  Newport -  Newport 1280's -  Sales Continue to increase throughout the area. Most significant sales gains have been made in cigarette outlets, tax differential outlets and convenience stores. The continuous buy down is the driving force behind volume gains, The recent change to $6.50 per carton buy down gives us a greater advantage over the competition thus further increasing sales. However, with the increased buy down value, many accounts are now being identified as having RJR's EDLP Program. This may have a negative impact on limiting our promotional support at retail for Maverick brands. The two Box 100’s packings are experiencing sales growth as distribution and awareness are now at higher levels. Maverick is now firmly established as the #2 or #3 overall brand in the inner city of Atlanta. Menthol Box 100 is now a power brand in urban Atlanta.  All box packings continue to enjoy substantial overall growth. The Lights Box packings continue to experience distribution and awareness increases. Much of the Light Box growth is coming from outside the Newport family. Newport is maintaining its market position despite competitive programs and the recent impact of the price increase,  Distribution objectives are being met. Brand is beginning to show slow, but steady gains overall since the change in target class of trade to General Market stores. Sales continue to be spotty. Couponed product tends to sell through, however non-couponed product sales are usually slow. Actual sales continue to favor Full Flavor 1206's over  Light 120's.  hS  OL:4e __label__Memo

Smart. (PROJECT B. 491, SA)  Introduction  Samples of a prototype: smokable article (hereinafter called “experimental. cigarettes") were submitted by D. R. Smart for determinatiion of aldehyde delivery. Kent III cigarettes with the tipping perforations taped were analyzed as. a control.  Experimental  Both. experimental and control cigarettes were conditioned in  the smoking laboratory at standard FTC temperature and humidity conditions. for a minimum of 24 hours. The first 9 puffs of each cigarette were collected under standard conditions. using a 35. mL puff volume, 2 seconds in duration, at one minute intervals, then a clearing; puff was. taken. The whole smoke was trapped in a 125 mL Dreschel bottle comtaining 50 mL of trapping reagent. The trapping reagent. contained 200 mL of 0.125% dinitrophenyl- hydrazine. (DNPH) in acetonitrile, 20 mL of 1.N perchloric acid, diluted to 500 mL with acetonitrile. After smoking, the DNPH- smoke solution was neutralized with 2 mL of 1 N triethylamine.  The DNPH complexed smoke solutions were analyzed by HPLC-UV analysis at 360 nm. The Hewlett Packard 1090 M HPLC was equipped with Novapak. (C18) column 3.9: x 150 mm, with a 5 fim particle size. The mobile phase was acettonitrile, water, tetrahydrofuran (60:30:10) with a flow rate off 1 mL/min. An injection volume: of 10 PL was: used. Following each analysis, the column was washed with. acetonitrile at. 2 mL/min for 30: minutes.  Results  The aldehyde deliveries for the experimental cigarettes verses the Kent III’ control cigarettes are reported in Table 1. The aldehyde deliveries were substantially less for the experimental cigarettes.  Ce8S2eLE __label__Memo

Ford  The Council for Tobacco Research 900 Third Avenue  New York, N.Y. 10022  U.S.A.     3231     Dear Don:  It was lovely to talk to you on the phone. As I have said to you my outlook of life is now different. May I please request an extension without further funding of our grant entitled “Investigation into the Role of Regulatory Peptides in Human Lung Disease" Grant No. 1438A, which we have held jointly with Steve Bloom for the past years. The reason is the that we have now established a very strong link with our colleague surgeons, in particular Professor Magdi Yacoub from Harefield Hospital, and Mr. John Wallwork from Papworth Hospital, both groups of which are involved in heart lung transplants.  We have done sufficient pilot experiments to be able to say that a number of novel techniques are now established in our Unit, over and above biochemical numerical estimation and chemical characterisation of extractable peptides, and their immunocytochemical localisation in tissue sections. These include, tn vitro autoradiography for the mapping and characterisation of binding sites and Tn situ hybridisation/Nothern blot analysis for the study of the mRNA directing neuropeptide/endocrine peptide synthesis. These techniques now work very well in human tissue and we have established a baseline to investigate pathology. Unlike earlier days when availability of human diseased lung and heart tissue was difficult, now we have increased use of surgical transplantation technology. This material is plentiful and fully available. The potential of investigating diseased state in human applying modern technology is therefore with us and we would very much like to «rite up an exciting extension grant application to the best of our abilities and hence our delay. These techniques could open up a new field of investigative pathology.     I very much hope this will not cause too much inconvenience to the Council for Tobacco Research and I look forward to hearing from you.  Best personal regards,  @ = sutia w. Potak, vse mp FRCPath.

By that time, we should have completed two pilot groups.  If you prefer that we include data from a third group, it will take longer.  The earliest we could start a third group is in January. The Phase 1 report would include the results of the focus group, a description of our Baseline and Follow-up Questionnaires, a description of the smoking cessation group program, and the initial outcome of two (or three) pilot groups.

A general consumer survey recently completed in Japan further indicated that the low tar segment has considerable growth potential, The segment of smokers who are health conacious now comprise 32% of  the smoker population. Low tar cigarettes will undoubtedly have special appeal for this smoker group.  In an effort to penetrate this segment, PMKK has developed two  prototypes -- Olive I which is the Mount blend with 8mg, delivery. and Ulive 11 which is the mount blend with Gmg. delivery. .  QUALITATIVES  Two praduct tests hava recently been completed pairing each Oliva prototype with Caster.  Tha objactive of these studies are as follows:  1. To measure the acceptability of the Olive prototype to the  Japanasa smoker in general and to the Caster smoker in particular,  2. To evaluate the smoking characteristics of these prototypes as compared to Caster for future preduct development,  This report addresses the results of Test 2 -- Olive II vs, Caster. The results of Teast 1 -- Olive I vs. Caster have been released under separate cover,  Olive II was tested among two groups, Caster smokers and non-Caster smokers, the latter constituting a general representation of the Japanese smoker market.  ho S8hOhOoS2 __label__Memo

As an interim step, I propose that we consider combining the web gathered cigarette technology with conventional cut filler/ cigarette~-making capabilities. If we can feed the tobacco web into the center of the cigarette maker (Jim Pryor’s web funnel guide) and feed the cut filler to the periphery, we may be able to obtain some of the benefits of the web gathered cigarette technology sooner than originally projected.  In essence, this approach could provide incremental improveménts to our current products while minimizing the risks associated with a wholesale change.  I look forward to discussing this approach with the team at the next meeting and appreciate your interest and support.  diy  Jennifer Bailey __label__Letter

dune 2.  Hepatitis A: antibodies are but illness is not  prevalent  Research on hepatitis A may lag behind that on hepatitis 8, but a clinical picture of type A disease is becoming more clear.  The words “subclinical picture” might be more accurate, however, because according t Jules L. Dien- ptag. MD, and co-workers, much of the disease produced by the hepatitis A virus is not clinically apparent. They suggest it is this sporadic, inapparent infection that maintains the hepatitis A virus in nature between major detectable outbreaks  Recently in New York City, in serological testing of more than 1,000 specimens. this research team foun antibodies to hepatitis A virus in 91% of middle class volunteer blood donors and in 60% of poor persons frotn the inner city. Despite this prevalence, less than 5% of these people could remember having had heps- titis. The investigators say this is “consistent with the belief that most cases are clinically inapparent ”  Even when hepatitis A is clinically apparent. Dr Dienstag told an American College of Physicians audience in Boston, usually it is a mild, self-limited illness. Hepatic encephalopathy develops in a few patients, but, in the outbreaks that Dr Dienstag and colleagues have studied. all patients have survived. Thus, he ssid, evidence from these and other studies euggests thot hepatitis A rarely fulminates, and the virus so far has not been associated serologically with chronic liver disease.  Until recently, he says, most of what was known about the epidemiology of hepatitis A was learned from studies with volunteers and observations during natural outbreaks. Now that the hepatitis A virus has been identified and its antibody can be detected by immune adherence hemagglutination, radioimmu- noassay, complement fixation. and immune electron microscopy, “the means are at hand to test and extend our current underetanding of this virus.”  The virus contains RNA, Dr Dienstag pointed ovt, and it is “most likely an enterovirus” of the icosahedral picorna group, “although a few properties don’! fir”  He and his colleagues report that exposure to hepa- titis A virus is much more likely than exposure to the type B virus. A two to six times greater prevalence of antibodies to type A than to type B has been found in most populations studied in the United States and for both sexes The likelihood of exposure increases with the person's age, decreases with rising socroeconemic class. and varies from country to country in relation to their stages of development, emphasis on sanita-  JAMA.

With regord to age. the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis A virus increases with age in all socioeco- nomic groups tested, approaching 80% among persons 50 or older. It is possible that these older people were exposed to the virus years ago when living conditions were leas hygienic. Support for this idea is found in the declining number of reported childhood cases of hepatitis A in this country in recent years. However, anti-hepatitis A titers in immune serum globulin collected in large cities like Boston in the last 30 years have not shown a similar decline.  Another possibility is that, et least in urban areas, there may be continuous exposure throughout life At least half the people living in the lowes socioeconomic areas of New York appear to become infecied by the time they reach their 20s. But in neighborhoods where people of a higher socioeconomic class live, serological testing by age groups has to extend to people in their 40; and $0s before o SO% rate of exposure is reached.  Say Dr Dienstag and colleagues’ “One implication of these seroepidemiologic studies is the advisability of preparing immune serum globulin from plasma of older, lower socioeconomic class urban individuals ”  The inverse relationship of exposure to hepatitis A virus and socioeconomic class hes been reported by several investigators and holds “whether sotivece- nomic class is defined by level of education, religious group, working class or prison status. census classif- cation, or underdeveloped vs developed counir: ~  continued on pay: 2386     Medical Nows  Medical News ~         ,     1978     2329  pps. __label__Scientific

4yG-Chromo-Sister Chrom-In Vitro Setooer, 1983  PYRPOSE     The sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay detects the ability of a chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. The test may pe performed in vitro, using, for example, rodent or human ‘cells, or in vivo using mammals, for example, rodents such as  mice, rats and hamsters.  Il. DEFINITION  Sister chromatid exchanges represent reciprocal interchanges 2f the two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. These exchanges are visualized during the metaphase portion of the cell cycle and presumably require enzymatic incision, translocation and ligation of at least cvo DNA helices.  IIL. RSFSRENCE SUBSTANCES  ne  Not applicable. IV. TEST METHCD  Ae Principle  Following exposure of cell cultures to test chemicals, they are allowed to replicate in the presence of promodeoxyuridine (3rdU), followed by treatment with colchicine or colcemid to arrest cells in a metaphase- like stage of mitosis (c-metaphase). Cells are then narvested and chromosome preparations made. Preparations are stained and metaphase cells analyzed  for SCEs.  B. Description  In vitro SCE assays may employ monolayer or suspension cultures of established cell lines, cell strains or primary cell cultures. Cell cultures are exposed to test chemical and are allowed to replicate in the presence of BrdU. Prior to harvest, cells are treated with a spindle inhibitor (e.g. Colchicine or Colcemid *) to accumulate cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome preparations from cells are made, stained and analyzed  for SCEs.  —  SO88 O860S __label__Report
MEMORANDUM  April 7, 1976 TO: George Tel ford J FROM: Larry outude A RE: TRUE "QUIT" CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS  I have prepared the following analysis based on the Gallup and Robinson data for True "Quit" ads tested to date, a total of 15 observations. The ads tested ran during May, 1975 and February, 1976, and included the original | Tip-in test of the campaign. Although this analysis covers male smokers only, female data is also available if you find this type of report to  be useful.  This memo will:  1) Track effectiveness over time, and 2) attempt to isolate the ‘reasons for success or failure.  Listed below is a re-cap of each G & R observation of a True "Quit" ad. Also listed are average smoker scores for all cigarette ads (including True) run in the test issues, and average smoker scores for all Super Hi-Fi brands (excluding True) run in the test issues. Initial True scores were above the average for all cigarettes but fell below average in the third observation. The next 8 observations scored below average, while recent ads have scored much higher. However, the True "Quit" ads have consistently outperformed the average competitive Super Hi-Fi ads throughout the campaign.

The strategy is based upon the information provided us in the October 1990 "Cigarette Excise Legislation Priority 1 States" document.  Resources  In order to shape the state excise tax debate and influence its outcome, the LMC will utilize and access existing resources as well as develop new contacts where possible.

JUL 14 185  AMA Proposal Includes Regulating Tobacco as “Drug Delivery Vehicle’  TOBACCO, From Al ~  and that the industry deliberately con- cealed its knowledge from the public and the courts,  “No right-thinking individual can ig- nore the evidence” of tobacco industry duplicity, the JAMA editorial conclud- ed, “We should all be outraged, and we should force the removal of: this seourge from our nation and by so do- ing set an example for the world.”  The articles, taking up much of ‘next week's issue of JAMA, are based on an exhaustive analysis of internal tobacco industry documents conducted by a team headed by Stanton A. Glantz of the University of California at San Francisco, a prominent ant-smoking activist, The Brown & Williamson To- bacco Company documents have been the subject of newspaper articles and congressional hearings over the past year. The five articles provide the scientific review of the materials. vis though the major findings have been widely reported, Glantz said this schol- arly approach could serve as a guide for regulators, lawmakers, judges and others. “I see the big effect of these papers on the policymaking process,” Glantz said.  The Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company issued 2 statement calling the JAMA articles “little more than a cherry-picking exercise” that selec- tively quoted statements from thou- sands of pages of documents stolen from the company.  Administration officials said yester- day that White House and FDA offi- cials have been discussing options aimed at stopping the sale or promo- tion of tobacco products to minors. They said the discussions had reached “senior political levels” within the     White House but that the president had not been directly involved, and that no plan had been presented to  Reports that the administration  could be nearing a decision on whether :  to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco sparked a furor among lawmakers.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R- Ga.) said the FDA had “lost its mind” for “picking a brand new fight when we haven’t won the far more serious fights about crack and cocaine and her- cin.” Other lawmakers called for the resignation of FDA Commissioner Da- vid A. Kessler.  But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D- Calif.) said that the opposition to regu- lation was coordinated by the political- ly powerful tobacco industry. “When the industry tells them to jump, the only question is, how high?” he said.  Clinton said yesterday in a Rose Garden appearance that he was most concerned with “the impact of ciga- rette smoking, particularly on our young people.”  In a statement yesterday, Kessler said, “The focus of our attention is to find ways to discourage children from starting [to smoke] in the first place. The administration is discussing what options to pursue, and as normally happens, any significant proposed reg- wation involves discussions with de- partment and White House officials.”  Administration sources said yester- day that in recent weeks, policymak- ers have been discussing five or six regulatory “option papers,” focusing on blocking tobacco marketing and sales to minors,  Regulatory actions under discussion between officials in the department of Health and Human Services, the White  House and the agency include prohibit- ing sales via vending machines: and other unrestricted distribution meth- ods such as handing out free’ samples at sporting events. Other proposals in- clude restricting advertising designed to appeal to children or teenagers.  But a broader, more comprehensive regulatory scheme being discussed over the past year is apparently not now under consideration. That contro- yersial proposal would have mandated the slow reduction of nicotine levels in tobacco products over a period of 10 or more years, eventually rendering them non-addictive. Such a program— if it could have been implemented and  if a threshold for addictiveness could:  be established—could have allowed youngsters to engage in experimenta- tion without becoming hooked, its ad- yocates claimed. But the plan never  * made it to the White House, sources  within the administration said.  Neither Kessler nor the .AMA is recommending a total ban on the sale of tobacco products, James S. Todd, executive vice president of the Ameri- can Medical Association, said in an in- terview yesterday, “Prohibition really doesn’t work. What we want to con- centrate on is education” and prevent- ing young people from taking up the tobacco habit.  Brennan Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, said yesterday that her organization believes that the FDA does not have the authority to regulate its products, but added, “If what the administration is talking about is reducing youth smoking, that’s certainly a goal shared by the to- baceb industry.”  Staff writer Ann Devroy contributed to this report. :  CHCTLLDPOS __label__News

AIDS RESEARCH AND HUMAN RETROVIRUSES Volame 10, Supplement 1, 1994 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc, Publishers        DNA Inoculation Induces Protective in Vivo Immune Responses against Cellular Challenge with HIV-1 Antigen-Expressing Cells  BIN WANG,'-] MICHAEL MERVA.? KESEN DANG,? KENNETH E. UGEN,'-] JEAN BOYER! WILLIAM V. WILLIAMS,!3 and DAVID B. WEINERI-3  ABSTRACT  Direct genetic immunization induces immune responses through the delivery of nonreplicating transcription units that drive the synthesis of specific foreign proteins within the inoculated host. These proteins are processed within host cells and through association with relevant MHC antigens that can become the subject of immune surveillance and elicit immune responses against the pathogen. Direct introduction of genes into mice has been reported to be antigenic as demonstrated by the use of this technique to develop immune responses against human growth hormone, influenza proteins, as well as HIV-1 proteins. Most recently the demonstra- tion of the use of this technology to produce anti-HIV-] immune responses has been reported in nonhuman pri- mates. Accordingly a more detailed analysis of this technology could generate important insight into the gen-  erality of this approach for immune therapy or vaccine design.  In this article we further our investigation of direct DNA inoculation as a tool for induction of relevant im- mune responses against HIV-1 in vive. We demonstrate expression of HIV-1 antigens in the muscle of geneti- cally the animals. Inoculated animals demonstrate significant cytotoxic T cell responses against HIV-1 antigen-     expressing targets. Furthermore, using a novel challenge system, we demonstrate that the majority of  immunized animals can reject lethal, HIV-1 antigen-expressing cell challenge in an antigen-specific manner. This technology has relevance for the development of immunization strategies against HIV because it provides  for specific antigen production iz vivo without the use of infectious agents.  INTRODUCTION  D”™ THE CouRSsE of natural viral infection, viral proteins are synthesized within host cells. Some of the viral pro- teins produced will be processed by the host cell machinery into peptides, a portion of which will be available for association with the host cell MHC class | antigens. These processed pep- lides facilitate assembly of the mature MHC class | complex, which consists of MHC class [ antigen, processed peptide, and the nonpaiymarphic protein B.-microglobulin. The assembled complex is translocated to the cell plasma membrane and can  become the target for immune surveillance, particularly by CD8-restricted T cells (cytotoxic T cells). Similarly, viral pro- teins can be shed from the infected cell, collected, and processed by professional antigen-presenting cells including both macrophages and dendritic cells. These. professional anti- gen-presenting cells process the proteins into peptides and as- semble a portion of these peptides along with the a and § chains of the MHC class {I pathway, resulting in the mature MHC class [ antigen complex. The assembled complex is transio- cated to the ceil plasma membrane and can become the target for immune surveillance, particularly by CD4-restricted T cells  'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 3600 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.

To that end, enclosed are the slides from  PM's presentation at the April 1, 1998 Panel meeting. The presentation merely outlines one testing approach for possible presentation to the government at some point in the future. The presentation also may serve as an outline for a paper to  be published by the industry.  At its April 1° meeting, the Panel agreed that the companies would evaluate PM's presentation, then take the following steps in preparation for another meeting to be held  in May 1998:  e Determine the extent to which each company is willing to share its testing approaches with other Panel members or the members of the yet-to-be-formed expert panel. Also consider how such presentations would be made {e.g., written papers versus oral briefings). These presentations presumably would be made at the 4  May 1998 meeting. on Xo  ® Identify those assays that, in the opinion of each Fs company, are not appropriate for testing ingredients. 2 on  e Provide thoughts regarding the composition and role of the expert panel. Drs. Frawley and Squire, and possibly Doull, already have been suggested as panel members. __label__Memo

Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Texas A&M University Health Science Center, College Station, Texas 77843-1114,' and MicroCarb, Inc., Gaithersburg, Manland 208707  Received 13 April 1994/Returned for modification 22 June 1994/Acccpted 18 August 1994  Infections with Shiga toxin-producing Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and Shiga-like toxin (SLT)-producing Escherichia coli cause outbreaks of bloody diarrhea in which patients are at risk for developing life-threatening complications involving the renal and central nervous systems. Histopathology studies and in vitro experi- ments suggested that the toxins damage toxin receptor-expressing endothelial cells (EC) lining glomerular and central nervous system capillaries. In the presence of inducible host factors (cytokines), EC sensitivity to SLT toxicity was increased ~1 million-fold. We hypothesized that to manifest the vascular lesions characteristic of infection with toxin-producing bacteria, two signals were needed: systemic toxins and elevated proinflamma- tory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-a], interleukin 1 [IL-1], and IL-6}. Human EC do not secrete these cytokines when stimulated with SLTs in vitro, suggesting that additional cells may be involved in pathogenesis. Therefore, we carried out comparative analyses of the capacity of purified (endotoxin-free) SLTs and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce cytokine mRNA and proteins from murine macrophages. The cells were essentially retractory to SLT cytotoxicity, expressing low to undetectable levels of toxin receptor. SLTs and LPS induced TNF activity and IL-6 expression from macrophages, although dose response and kinetics of cytokine induction differed. LPS was a more effective inducing agent than SLTs. SLT-I-induced TNF activity and IL-6 expression were delayed compared with induction mediated by LPS, IL-la production required ~24 h of exposure to SLTs or LPS. Macrophages from LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice produced low levels of TNE activity when treated with SLT-I, suggesting that LPS and SLTs may utilize separate signaling pathways  for cytokine induction.  Infections with Shigella dysenteriae type 1 or enterohemor- thagic Escherichia coli are associated with outbreaks of bacil- lary dysentery or hemorrhagic colitis, respectively. Patients with these bloody diarrheal diseases are also at increased risk for the development of life-threatening complications involv- ing the renal and central nervous systems (2, 27). One of these sequelae, the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), is a major cause of pediatric acute renal failure. 5. dysenteriae type 1 expresses high tevels of a potent cytotoxin called Shiga toxin. Enterohemorthagic £. coli strains produce one or more exo- toxins which are collectively referred to as Shiga-like toxins (SLTs) or verocytotoxins. Serologic and nucleotide sequencing analyses showed that SLTs may be classified on the basis of their antigenic and genetic relationship to Shiga toxin (re- viewed in reference 42); SLT type I (SLT-I) is virtually identical to Shiga toxin, while SLT-II is ~56% homologous to Shiga toxin or SLT-I at the deduced amino acid sequence level. Although genetic variants of the toxins have been described, extensive biochemical and biologic studies have shown that all members of the SLT family are AB; holotoxins which act by inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis and utilize the neutral glycolipids globotriaosyiceramide (Gb,) or globotetraosylcer- amide (Gb,) as functional receptors (reviewed in references 10, 35, and 42).  The precise role of the toxins in colonic ulceration and bloody diarrhea or in the development of postdiarrheal sys- temic complications is not known. Comparative histopatho- logic examination of tissues from macaque monkeys fed either an invasive toxigenic S. dysenteriae type 1 strain or an atoxi-  * Corresponding author. Phone: (409) 845-1313.

Examination of kidney tissue from HUS patients showed damage to glomeruli, characterized by the swelling and detachment of glomerular endothelial cells (EC) from the basement membrane accom- panied by the deposition of microthrombi and influx of in- flammatory cells mto the glomeruli (46, 47), Rabbits given intravenous SLTs developed severe edema and petechial hem- orrhages in the cecal mucosa and widespread thrombotic microangiopathy, edema, and ischemic necrosis in the brain and spinal cord. Macrophages were occasionally found in the damaged tissues (4, 48, 65). Mice given SLTs developed acute bilateral renal tubular necrosis, and the sites of toxin-mediated damage and expression of Gb, were directly correlated (55, 61). Taken together, these data support the concept that the toxins act in vivo to specifically damage Gb3-expressing cells in target organs, EC damage may then facilitate the exudation of neutrophils and monocytes into the affected tissues.  Shiga toxin and SLTs were shown to be directly toxic for human vascular EC in vitro (43, 58), although the doses of toxin necessary to manifest EC killing were 10° to 10° times greater than the doses used ta lyse toxin-sensitive cell lines such as Vero or HeLa cells. We and others have found, however, that when EC were incubated in the presence of bacterial endotoxins or the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-e (TNF-«) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), they were markedly sensitized to the cytotoxic action of SLTs (33, 34, 58). The mechanism of cytokine-mediated toxin sensitization may involve increased synthesis and membrane expression of Gb; (59). Barrett ct al.

I hope you will find a way to make your readers aware of its contents and its availability, free of charge, from The Tobacco Institute.  Whether it be the issue of women and smoking, or any of the other controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products, we sincerely believe that a full, free and informed discussion of the issues is in the public's best interest. We agree with  the American Cancer Society's conviction that, "adult individuals must make up their own minds about smoking but, it requizes  that individuals know the facts."  For too long, adversaries of tobacco have attempted to influence those adult personal decisions, as well as public policy, with assumptions, opinions or conjectures not supported by scientific or medical fact.  FACT OR FANCY? was produced to present more factual, and balanced, answers on the nealth question about which mature women need to know more.     If we may provide any further information to you or your readers, please contact me. I have included our toll-free telephone number for the use of anyone desiring additional information or a copy of this publication.  Additionally, please consider The Tobacco Institute as a ref- erence source the next cime you have occasion to write about any aspect of the tobacco industry or the controversies surrounding the use of tobacco products.

Marmor     Lorillard Research Center, Lorillard, Inc., Greensboro, N.C., USA  SUMMARY  Cigarettes with closely matched physical characteristics were subjected to static burns inside a modified bell jar apparatus in order to investigate the effects of variations in cigarette construction and composition on the odor of sidestream smoke. Cambridge filter pads moistened with mineral oil and suspended inside the bell jars were highly effective transfer materials which captured the sidestream smoke odors. Triangle test odor evaluations of the exposed Cambridge pads established significant differences at the 95% confidence level between sidestream odors from cigarettes made with 100% burley, flue-cured, or oriental tobacco. Differences were also found between sidestream odors from tobacco grades within a single tobacco type and between equal blends of two tobacco types. Consistent with studies of sidestream menthol delivery and menthol levels needed to detect a just noticeable difference, no significant sidestream odor  differences were found between menthol and non-menthol versions  of the same cigarette.  *Presented at the 39th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference, Montreal, October 1985.

The test can be performed In a few minutes by @ techni: dan using equipment that costs only $150. He simply runs a small metal wheel over prescribed areas of the pay ilent's skin.  The wheel is an electrode, attached to two small batter. Jes. Another electrode is at- tached to the patient’s leg. A  meter records the resistance encountered by the flow of current, and the technician maps the pattern on a draw- ing of the human body.  “Almost everything that hap- pens in the body Is referred to the skin,” said Dr. Curt P. Richter, who has been work ing on the technique for 20 years. ‘A number of changes in internal organs can be de tected this way. It is particu. larly useful in some vascular diseases (diseases of the circu- latory system}."  What the technician records is the resistance of the skin alone to the electrie current.

Goldsmith Date: August 13, 1980  Hamish Maxwell  Capital Appropriation Request Fabriques de Tabac Reunies (Switzerland)  - New Research and Development Building at Neuchatel SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000 at U.S. $1 = SF 1.65)  Authority Requested  Philip Morris International requests approval from the Board of Directors for Fabriques de Tabac Reunies to spend SF 20,097,000 (U.S. $12,180,000) for the design, construction and installation of laboratory equipment and furniture for a new Research and Development building in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Previously authorized expenditures of SF 600,600 (U.S. $367,000) for engi- neering study and design are included in the above figure.  Background _  The proposed Research and Development center in Neuchatel will. provide services for. the entire European Region’ as local affil- -- dates have only quality control departments. The projected growth in European production (from 76.8 billion cigarettes in 1979 to 157.6 billion in 1984), the development of new brands and the addition of new technology will require greater and more complex services from the R&D Department in the future.  The R&D Department currently employs 121 people located in six separate buildings providing total area of 24,866 square feet. Three of these buildings are rented outside the main FTR manufac- turing complex. The physical decentralization of the R&D function is believed by management to have a negative impact on current  and potential performance, particularly in light of the projected departmental expansion.  Proposal  After consideration of the available alternatives, local management recommends construction of the new building and elimination of four of the six buildings presently in use. This will centralize the R&D Department in the manufacturing complex. The building will have four floors and provide 38,800 gross square feet and 20,700 square feet of laboratory and office space. It will accommodate  the building will be constructed to allow for further expansion if required. When combined with the two existing buildings to be retained, the total laboratory and office space for R&D will be 39,013 square feet by completion in 1982.  PERbETETog __label__Memo

NICKLES LESS PESSIMISTIC OVER THE FUTURE OF TOBACCO SETTLEMENT ~~ Saying that he could support a tax increase on smokers to help pay for alternative proposals, Nickles, R-Okla., did not provide specifics on how large a tax increase he would support but made it clear a Democratic pian of a gradual $ 1.50-per-pack increase was out of the question. "We are not going to pass a bill the Democrats are looking at just to increase taxes and spend more  money, '' he said. Still, having Nickles leave the door open for any kind of tax increase to pay for a government program in an election year may be the strongest evidence of the commitment he and others have to passing some sort of anti-tobacco legislation and of the pressure they are under to come through on that commitment. Presented with the historic agreement hammered out by the industry and state attorneys general last year, lawmakers have been grappling with how to respond ever since. Nickles, who for months has been extremely negative about the chances the tobacco settlement would be passed into law, repeatedly has vowed to pass some sort of legislation directed at warning teens against smoking as well as drug use. "I think we will pass legislation this year,'' he said. In addition to a direct tax increase, the senator said lawmakers also might consider a look-back approach that would give the government the authority to fine the tobacco industry if it did not reduce teen smoking. Nickles became the Senate Republican point man on the tobacco settlement late last year. Recently Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has most of the jurisdiction over that kind of. legislation, has stepped in as the lead Republican, at least for now. Nickles, who serves as the Senate majority whip and holds tremendous power over floor action, said he would take whatever came  .RJRO000000057002052  » POOA4 9323     696 L60e¢ __label__Email

Most educational and persuasive programs in public schools do not appear to deter the onset of smoking”. The recognition that narrow strategies  of prevention are not effective has led researchers to probe the problem more carefully in search of the critical social and psychological factors ° and processes which determine the onset of smoking4>:’, Notions of how and  why adolescents start smoking hgve yielded some promising early results in recent intervention studies®»4» » but despite considerable attention to the subject, no comprehensive model of the onset of smoking has been articulated  ? i i]  & Comprehensive reviews of the literature®»? list many different variables that have been associated with smoking among adolescents, but these vari- ables are usually only categorized rather than constructed into a general  explanatory model. Individual research reports have tended to concentrate  on only a few of the factors that may be directly related to smoking rather than complex models of direct, indirect, and interactive effects. Thus,  our understanding of how and why young people become habitual cigarette smokers has remained at a fairly basic level.  cJ  is & Investigators studying adolescent alcohol and drug use, behaviors which ~ are strongly correlated with cigarette smoking!0, have proposed and re- searched models of the onset of. those behaviors, but they have tended f° be more descriptive than explanatory. For example, Jessor and Jessor! show that marijuana use is correlated with a lack of conventional social i and personal values and control. Similar findings are reported with | respect to alcohol!?., Kandel (1975) 13 Proposes stages of adolescent involvement in the use of various substances and provides data which i show that experimentation with cigarettes, beer, and wine usually pre- cedes the use of stronger licit and illicit substances. Smith and Fogg (1978)14 focus on the role of personality and find that those who smoke x and use drugs do not conform to adult expectations regarding obedience and self-control. Thus, this line of inquiry has been relatively unsuc- cessful at generating an explanatory model of substance-use onset. DD In this paper we will Present a general model describing the causes of  cigarette smoking and describe some studies undertaken to validate the model.  9L8T 6LHOS  |  u73 __label__Scientific

THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WASHINGTON  wat? iw  The Honorable Robert E. Wise, Jr.  House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515  Dear Congressman Wise:  My responsibility as Secretary of Veterans Affairs! is to provide a safe patient environment. America’s proud veterans, whether smokers or not, require no artificial crutch o which to base thelr dignity. It is inherent.  1  Recently, you received a letter from Representatives Wise and Ridge urging you to support the smoking provisions jincluded in H.R. 3192. They would have you believe that it is a matter of dignity to permit smoking inside VA health care facilities. Tne issue is not dignity -- the issue is health care.  [  artery, or ventilation tubes to enable breathing, because smoking has so impaired their health. Or the patients lwho suffer the side effects of chemotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, loss of hair, and infections. These are the [dreadful results of smoking. And these same ill effects can happen to  Consider those who must endure catheters in the es or  non-smokers who are forced to endure passive smoke.  The smoking provisions are the antithesis of good {health practices. smoking kills and second-hand smoke kills. | Let me  get. the record straight on a few issues raised by the — congressmen:  ° Only one of four veterans smoke. We provide gutdoor smoking shelters at VA medical centers. Long term and chronic care patients can still purchase tobagco from VA canteens with medioal approval of their physicians. We have instituted smoking owho wie  programs to assist patients and employees who |wish to stop snoking.  °o The veteran who chooses to smoke does so of his own accord. VA's policy establishes medical center environments that encourage non-smoking behavior, particularly among people who already have major health problems which are aggravated by smoking, and protects those who do not smoke and who can be damaged by exposure to others’ snoke.  | | \ | | I     p16 vS2ts __label__Letter

We will maintain current pricing on WINSTON $4,00/$.40 specially marked product while these promotional supplies last. Contact your cigarette supplier for availability and additional information. By maintaining your inventories on WINSTON $4.00/$.40 specially marked product and other specially marked . product, you can continue to offer to your.customers a low price on these brands.  ConAsEmMehs” Our naw pricing effectively creates two price tiers for our products, premium and discount. All brand styles within each pricing tier (reqular/King/ 100/120) will be priced the same. We suggest that you consult with your cigarette supplier or chain headquarters for complete detalls of price changes that may have resulted from our announcement.  _ {tis recommended that you sell through on-hand higher priced inventories prior to rolling back your retail prices to consumers, We also suggest you reset your price for all brand styles in the premium and discount ‘categories at one time, thereby eliminating confusion for both stora personnel and customers. Instead of trying to target a certain date, our objective Is that you have maximum flexibility In resetting your prices as” most appropriate for you based upon your store's inventory situation.  We will not offer a retall participation/inventory protection program. Each retailer Is In the best position to tailor its pricing strategies to fit its particular Inventory levels, and It would be extremely difficult for us to audit the Inventory of over 300,000 retali outlets and offer a fair reconciliation of on-hand Inventory.  During the week of August 2, 1993, you will receive rallback point-of-sale materials to use in communicating your new lower prices to your customers.

Issue - Current Considerations  Currently SR's/RR’s report in-stock or OOS on Region designated brand styles resulting in: - Limited measures which provide little or no actionable information  - Inconsistent brand style tracking prevents chain, area, national rollup/views  - Current report is measured as % of doors - thereby assuming all accounts are equal  - Current report does not identify conditions/problems nor does it provide degree or extent of conditions  Objective  The objective of the revised product availability reporting procedures is to provide better measures and more actionable information on product availability at retail.  Action Steps for revised product availabllity reporting procedures.  1) Begin to track/monitor OOS at retail on dur top 20 national brand styles and region identified market opportunity brand styles effective August 26, 1996. (We will place the top 20 brand styles in SIS here in Winston-Salem...see attached list.)  - SR’s/RR’s will continue to report OOS at retail but with brand style focused on identified national and market place business needs. No change in reporting other than the number and selection of brand styles.  2) Each region must provide a list of brand styles (suggest no more than 5 to 10 - if any at all) that you would like to measure that are not included in the national top 20 brand styles.  Note to RSM's/RBM's: Piease submit these brand styles by Region to your respective AMO and they will ensure placement in SIS for August 26, 1996 effective date -  Respond to AMO week of August 19, 1996.     9Lezt 66LTS __label__Report

It’s called PIN Protection (Personal Identification Number). The PIN feature is a proven method in deterring fraudulent cellular use.  The PIN is necessary to allow you to place calls while roaming outside of North Carolina. While traveling, you will need to enter the PIN each day before placing your first call, entering a new city, when you return to North Carolina and anytime your call cannot be completed. Also, if you are working or traveling past midnight on any given day, you will have to re-enter the PIN at that time.  PROCEDURE:  When you are roaming and after you have powered up your phone, you will dial *560, the PIN, [SEND] and [END]. This activates the phone and makes it available to place calls. You only have to do this once each day, so long as you remain in the same service  RJR0000000507030726 70047 1080  eroe osees __label__Email

gey HATM,. DOT  INHALATION TOXICOLOGY OF GLYCEROL  6.4.3.4.2 General methods a for 14-day Glycerol Inhalation Study in Rats Conducted at a Contract Laboratory  6.4.3.4.2.1. Introduction  A 14-day nose-only inhalation study was conducted at Battelle’s Pacific Northwest Laboratory under contract to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco company. The objective of the study was to investigate the potential biological effects, if any, of 10 consecutive  workday exposures of glycerol aerosol in rats. In addition, the study was conducted to provide dose selection information for a  possible subchronic inhalation study of the same material.  6.4.3.4.2.2 Experimental Design  The study included four experimental groups. One group was exposed only to fresh filtered air and three groups were exposed to concentrations of glycerol aerosol of 1, 2 or 4 mg/liter; respectively. Exposures were conducted for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for ten consecutive workdays. Each exposure group  consisted of 10 male and 10 female rats which were 4 to 5 weeks old at receipt.  6.4.3.4.2.3 Experimental Animals  The Sprague-Dawley-derived rat was chosen as the test system for this study because of the historical data base available from previously conducted inhalation studies and its compatibility with other endpoints of interest to R.J. Reynolds. In addition, this strain has a lower incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia than does the other commonly utilized F-344 rat.  Test subjects were quarantined for 3 weeks and screened for clinical abnormalities prior to selection for test article  exposure. Complete serology evaluations were conducted twice, at a two week interval, prior to study start.  6.4.3.4.2.4 Animal Husbandry  Rats were individually housed in hanging, stainless steel wire mesh cages which were cleaned weekly. Animal care was in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and amendments (Public Law 91-579) "Specifications for the Humane handling, Care, Treatment and Transportation of Warm-blooded Animals other than Dogs, Cats, Rabbits, Hamsters, Guinea Pigs and Nonhuman Primates." Room conditions included 12 hours of dark, 12 hours  2029 2190S __label__Report

Last year, three million people started to smoke.  This year, the criticism will continue. And next year, too. Butafter all is said and done, another three million people will probably start smoking.  Maybe the people who criticize smoking should stare the facts in the face. Then they might recommend that if you've decided to smoke, but are concerned about ‘tar’ and nicotine, you might smoke Vantage.  Vantage offers smokers the rich, tobacco flavor they've come to appreciate. Witha substantial cut in ‘tar’ and nicotine.  So if you're one of those smokers who is now deciding between high ‘tar’ and nicotine cigarettes that taste good, and Tow tar and nicotine cigarettes that taste like nothing, you might appreciate Vantage.  Because Vantage is both high in flavor and low in ‘tar’ and nicotine.  That's why so many people who have smoked for many years have switched to Vantage.  And that’s why, if you've just started to smoke this year, we suggest you try Vantage yourself.                        ©)  VANTAGE      > OB San ~ Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking ts Dangerous to Your Health. _. . _. .

HK51522009  Importance of injection site for coronary blood flow determinations by microspheres in rats  PIERRE WICKER AND ROBERT C. TARAZI | Research Division, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44106  WICKER, PIERRE, AND Ropert C. Tanazi. Importence of injection site for coronary blood flow determinations by micra- spheres in rats. Am. J. Physiol. 242 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 11): H94-H97, 1982.—Because coronary blood flow (CBF) detes- Tinations require that blood and microspheres be uniformly mixed in the root of the aorta, we developed a technique of left- atrial (LA) catheterization in rats and compared the variability of results obtained by LA injection and left-ventricular (LV) injection as regards systemic [cardiac output (CO)), proximal (coronary), and distal (renal, cerebral) flows in anesthetized animals. CBF values averaged 410 + 224 and 358 + $9 (SD) ml. min™’.100 g”’ from LV and LA injection, respectively, or 5.7 + 2.9 and 4.9 + 1.3 (SD) %CO. The variability with LA injection was significantly lower than with LV injection as shown by the marked differences in standard deviations obtained with the two methods (224 vs. 99 ml-min™'.100 g~ or 2:9 vs. 1.3 SCO, P > 0.01). In contrast, no significant difference in variability was found for either CO or more distal regional flows. These results indicate that LV injections might be adequate for sys- temic flow and regional flows to relatively distal beds but that accurate measurements of CBF require LA injection of micro- spheres.  cardiac output; regional blood flow; left-atrial catheterization        SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION in 1967 by Rudolph ahd Hey- mann (13), the microsphere method has beeh extensively used because of its simplicity and the possibility of de- termining regional as well as systemic blood flow even in small animals like rats (7-9, 11, 14). However, the accu- racy of results from microsphere injections depends fun- damentally on the uniform mixing of microspheres in the bloodstream; in that respect the site of injection may be critical, particularly for coronary blood flow mieasure- ments. Because of alleged difficulties of left-atrial cathe- terization, most studies of rats have utilized a left-ven- tricular approach, assuming in the process that mixing was adequate (7, 9, 12, 14). However, experiments in dogs have shown that left-ventricular injections give less de- pendable results and more marked differences in the distribution of microspheres to the heart than injections into the left atrium (2, 5). Moreover our preliminary experiments in rats did show a high variability of coro- nary blood flow measurements with left-ventricular in- jections. We therefore developed a technique of left-atrial catheterization in rats thet could be performed with no major technical difficulties. This allowed us to compare the variability of blood flow detezminations made by left- atrial injections with that of measurements obtained by left-ventricle injection, as regards systemic (cardiac out-  He  put) and regional (coronary, renal, cerebral) flows. The results show that /) intra-atrial injections lead more consistently to adequate dispersion of the microspheres in the aortic root than do intraventricular injections and 2) the intra-atrial-injection technique must be preferred for precise determinations of coronary blood flow because of the lower variability resulting from better mixing of the microspheres.  METHODS  Experiments were carried out in anesthetized rats sep- arated into two groups. In group A (n = 10) the micro- spheres were injected first into the left atrium and sub- sequently into the left ventricle. In group B (n = 10) the left-ventricular injection was performed first followed by the intra-atrial injection. The sequence of studies was regularly alternated so that one animal of group A (left- atrial injection first) was followed by one of group B (left-ventricular injection first).  Preparation of rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were anes- thetized with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg ip), and anesthesia was subsequently maintained with small doses (6-10 mg/kg ip) given as required approximately every 30-45 min. The rats were intubated through the mouth and ventilated with room air. The same surgical sequence was used in all animals whatever the order of injection.  First, a catheter was positioned in the left atrium. The left-atrial appendage was exposed by thoracotomy through the third left intercostal space, the pericardium was opened, and a PE-10 tubing was advanced through a small cut of the lateral wall of the appendage, secured in place, and passed through the chest wall along the sternum. The chest was closed after lung expansion by positive-intratracheal pressure while a negative pressure was applied to the thoracic cavity. The animal was dis- connected from the respirator, and the rest of the exper- iment was performed while the rat was breathing spon- taneously.  Two catheters (made up of a 3- to 4-cm-long Teflon tubing inserted into a PE-50 tubing) were then advanced 3 and 3.6 cm in the aorta through a right- and left- femoral-artery cannulation, respectively. The right-fem- oral catheter was connected to a Micron MP-15 trans- ducer for blood pressure recording. The left catheter was used to withdraw blood. A PE-10 tubing catheter was finally inserted into he right-carotid artery.  In group A the carotid catheter was advanced into the left ventricle under blood pressure control after the left-  0363-6135/82/0000-0000801.25 Copyright © 1982 the American Physiological Society __label__Scientific

'R/GRANT NO, 2327M PROGRESS REPORT NO. 1 Period Covered: from 1/1/89 to 5/15/89 ame of Investigator: Joel P. Gallagher  Title of Original Grant: Nicotine and Its Direct Inhibitory Action in the Rat Septal Nuclei  Below are the four specific aims that were outlined to achieve the following overall objective, namely, to analyze in detail the membrane mechanisms by which nicotine activates a specific nicotinic receptor on septal neurons to yield inhibition.  A) Since nicotine hyperpolarizes directly dorsolateral septal neurons, we need to determine: the characteristics of the receptor responsible; the ionic specics and channel to which this receptor is coupled; and whether nicotine may also alter ion channels localized within the postsynaptic membrane that are not coupled to this nicotinic receptor.  B) We will determine how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission as recorded within our septal slice preparation, namely: 1) excitatory acid mediated excitatory transmission and 2) GABA mediated inhibitory transmission. These studies will include experiments to distinguish pre- and/or post-synaptic actions.  C) We will determine how nicotine interacts with several substances that we or others have demonstrated have biological activity within the septum, These substances are endogenous transmitters or modulators, ¢.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, somatostatin, etc.; or drugs, e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, etc.  D) Finally, using freshly dissociated septal neurons with patch clamp methodology we will examine the specific channels opened by nicotine and determine which, if any second-messenger systems may be associated with CNS nicotinic receptor activation.  mmary of results according to four specific aims stated above: @ 1. Nicotine hyperpolarizes DLSN neurons  a. Receptor type - Non - skeletal muscle nicotinic receptor  - somewhat sensitive to mecamylamine, but not sensitive to hexamethonium or d-tubocurarine  - completely blocked by kappa-BGTX (neuronal bungarotoxin)  b. Ionic species and channel coupled to CNS nicotinic receptor responsible for hyperpolarization.  - K* - channel  - Ca** - dependent, but does not require initial depolarization.  . response blocked by intracellular injection of GTA, while hyperpolarizations resulting from application of serotonin, norepinephrine or dopamine persist.  - response persists after pertussis toxin treatment which blocks GABA,-induced  hyperpolarization. 2. Nicotine can also depolarize these same neurons. a. Receptor type - different from hyperpolarization, since mecamylamine enhances depolarization. b. lonic Species - unknown, presently - depolarization associated with decreased conductance, maybe potassium ion, B, Nicotine alters synaptic transmission 1, Nicotine primarily acts to depress late hyperpolarizing response (LHP) and then fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). There appears to be little effect on excitatory synaptic potential, but additional experimetns using both non-NMDA and NMDA antagonists are required. C, Nicotine interaction with other substances - to be done. N. Nicotine action on freshly dissociated neurons - to be done.  esse see attached manuscript submitted to Nature and two abstracts. __label__Scientific

So it is no coincidence that the tobacco giant: is pitching the new smoke: to con: sumers just: like de- caf. Packs of: Next carry we word “De- Nic’ beneath the: Next logo. The brand's ads proudly prociaum:. ‘“‘Intro- ducing. de-nicotined tobacco with rich flavor." And, of course; the copy.aiso tells consumers that the nicotine-removal. process is natural.  Philip Morris’s normally chatty tobacco PR people are still refusing to talk about the product or its positioning, even though! Next is being tested in Toledo, Ohio: Omaha, Neb.; and Hartford. Conn.. The:     :, Campaign, created' by Lee Burnett Co.. is:  appearing in local and national media in-:  -. cluding, regional editions of Time, News:  week and People.  But marketers speculate that the com- pany’s “Smoke Sanka” strategy is de signed to make low-nicotine Next seem as soothingly (amillar to pulfers as possible. “They Nave set up.a simple analogy.” adds Al Ries. chairman of Trout & Ries: Ine.,  _ & New. York marketing-strategy firm. “In  the minds of people, having ‘a smoke anda cup:of coffee tend to be things you do to- gether.”  Moreover, the caffeine comparison en-  |. ables Philip Morris to imply it has a safer  lenges. Some industry critics warn the use of the word “de-nicotined” ts problematic scrutiny: At issue is: whether. consumers interpret it to mean no nicotine or 90 little  + nicotine that there are'so health risks is :.: volved. “This word is potentially misiesd:  * ing.” says Clif Douglas, assistant director  of the Coalition: on Smoking or Health.  “Some consumers will. consider. the prod- uct to be safe or safer than other tobacco products."  tho fact. Next has.) mulligrams:of nic- otine,.Uie same amount asin Cariton and Now.. But’ Next contains significantly. higher levels of tar:)!  Marketers also question Next's focus on: the issue of choice in the ad copy. Some: ads boast that the brand “offers smokers a: choice they have never had.” Others de-: clare: “The: Next choice is yours: But:an: ad man for a rival tobacco company 'cau- tions: “If you are a smoker wormed about tar and nicotine and you: are invited to: make choices,. your. next choice may. be to quit altogether.”  In any event, Philip Morris clearly be- lieves it has'a winner on its hands... Distnb-  utors in the citles where the brandis being:  tested say‘ the company is sparing no:ex-  pense to: launch the: product, even by. its:  own lavish standards. Asan incentive for  distributors to take on the: brand. Philip: Morris is paying them $60.4 case—double: the industry's standard rate. Even more:  unusual, salespeople are getting, pald a handsome 20 ‘cents for every carton they sell.  At. Geo. Canalos: Ine., Dennis: Grahi.,. vice president of. merchandising. says he: hasn't even begun giving: hls: Toledo-area. customers introductory. “buy. one, get one: free’ deals. but has already had to reorder:  Next three times. “I think Philip Morris ts on to something.” he says:  Greg Moses: a twopack-a-day. Cam- bridge Lights smoker in Sandusky, Ohio. who has sampled Next, agrees. “Caritons and Now are like sucking.on air,” Mr. Mo- ses says. “These Nexts havea flavor. and that's what a. smoker wants.”  eal  BIELIESZOR __label__News
Dr. Redford B. Williams, Jr. (Duke University Medical Center) opened the conference with a discussion of hostility and hormones as biobehavioral mechanisms in CAD. He said that looking at type A behavior is like looking at total cholesterol. There are a lot of components, some of which are toxic, some may be protective, and some may not be related to the development of CAD. The so-called global type A behavior should be broken down into its microcom ponents and their contributions, individually and in combination with other components, need to be assessed. The microcomponent concept may explain why some small angiographic studies have failed to show an effect of type A be-  “havior in CAD. The power of the "toxic" components was not strong enough to overcome the "protective" canponents in the small studies.  After adjusting for all the standard risk factors, type A behavior is related to coronary heart disease (CHD) only in people 55 years of age or younger. This is true for females as well as males but men are at a higher CHD risk. Dr. Williams said this age effect was there no matter how one looks at the data. He also said that global type A at sufficient power is related to CHD, and asked if biologically-vulnerable types A's died earlier and did not live long enough for the effect of type A behavior to be seen after age 55.  Looking at the components of type A behavior is the next step and all agreed that type A's have a potential for hostility. (It was also noted that type B's with CHD exhibit same characteristics of type A behavior, but not enough to be called type A's.) Another characteristic is the repression of anger. Those who express their anger do not have an increased amount of CHD. It was also noted that all risk factors get weaker as age increases. The sug- gestion was made that if population samples aged 45 years or over are em ployed, these people may be too old for the effect of many risk factors to be seen.  Another factor to be considered is that a lot of type A behavior may be determined by the sympathetic nervous system. Increased levels of cortisone, norepinephrine, and testosterone have been observed in type A's. Using these hormones, Dr. Williams is going to see if he can produce atherosclerosis in the Egyptian sand rat by chronically creating the type A hormonal milieu.!  Dc. Theodore M. Denbroeki (University of Maryland) discussed hostility and CAD. He said that global type A behavior is primarily characterized by loud, explosive, rapid speech, i.e.,; a vigorous voice style, and hostile peo- ple are more likely to speak this way. Some 80-85% of type A's exhibit explo- sive speech. Dr. Denbroski noted that Rosenman in his Western Collaborative Group Study found a ratio of type A's to type B's of approximately 50/50. However later studies, including MRFIT, have had ratios closer to 75/25. He questioned whether there had been a shift over time of investigators looking primarily at vigorous speech characteristics.  wee 1 The rat is mt a good model for atherosclerosis. However, Dr. Williams said  that this particular rat, a desert animal, develops atherosclerosis readily when fed a normal diet. Dr. James Blumenthal, also from Duke, told me Dr. - Williams was also going to use miniature swine, which is a good model.  LES6 ETHOS __label__Report
Soulard  MEMORANDUM May 14, 1987     TO: J. D. Heck  FROM: A. P. Deaton T. A. Vollmuth  SUBJECT: Monthly Summary Report for Life Sciences Section: April  The following text is a summary of the activity of the Life Sciences section during the month of April, 1987. For the most _ ‘part, this report is organized by study.  1. AMES ASSAY (Hazleton Laboratories America)  The following compounds were sent out for testing in April: BOO6, B212,  The following report was received and accepted as final: B208.  2. AMES ASSAY (Lorillard Research Center)  The following reports were accepted as finals: A078, AO91, A093, A143, BO59, B061, B208, B209, B210, B211.  Several Cigarette Smoke Condensates, including D019, D023, D029, D033, D034 and Reference samples were tested for comparative mutagenicity in the Ames assay. Very little __ evidence of mutagenicity was exhibited for these samples and no obvious differences were noted between samples. Since these samples were frozen prior to testing, it is thought that more reliable results might be obtained with fresher samples. This may be pursued in a future study.  3. UDS ASSAY (Microbiological Associates) The following compounds were sent out for testing in April:  B004, BO10, B129, B144.  4. UDS ASSAY (Hazleton Laboratories America)  S689S82L8  Final revisions were made to the UDS protocol and approval given for Hazleton to test compounds at a rate of 4 per month. __label__Memo
